Trump who was involved in what he called an \\u201coperation\\u201d to keep Mr. Trump in office after he lost the 2020 election.\", \"The subpoena was the committee\\u2019s latest attempt to obtain information about efforts underway in Mr. Trump\\u2019s White House to invalidate the election. In his book, titled \\u201cIn Trump Time,\\u201d and in interviews with The New York Times and other outlets, Mr. Navarro has said that he worked with Stephen K. Bannon and other allies of Mr. Trump to develop and carry out a plan to delay Congress\\u2019s formal count of the 2020 presidential election results to buy time to change the outcome.\", \"Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the chairman of the committee, highlighted how openly and proudly Mr. Navarro has discussed those machinations, saying he \\u201chasn\\u2019t been shy about his role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and has even discussed the former president\\u2019s support for those plans.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Navarro has insisted that the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6 was not part of his plans, which he said included having Vice President Mike Pence reject electors for Joseph R. Biden Jr. when Congress met in a joint session to formally count them.\", \"\\u201cTo pull off an operation Bannon has dubbed the Green Bay Sweep \\u2014 and thereby keep President Trump in the White House for a second term \\u2014 we must have only peace and calm,\\u201d Mr. Navarro wrote in his book.\", \"He said the idea was for Mr. Pence to be the \\u201cquarterback\\u201d of the plan and \\u201cput certification of the election on ice for at least another several weeks while Congress and the various state legislatures involved investigate all of the fraud and election irregularities.\\u201d\", \"There has been no evidence of widespread fraud or irregularities in the 2020 election, though Mr. Trump continues to claim that it was \\u201cstolen\\u201d from him.\", \"Mr. Navarro also wrote a 36-page report alleging election fraud as part of what he called an \\u201cImmaculate Deception.\\u201d In an interview with The Times, he said he relied on \\u201cthousands of affidavits\\u201d from Mr. Trump\\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and Bernard B. Kerik, the former New York police commissioner, to help produce the report, which claimed there \\u201cmay well have been a coordinated strategy to effectively stack the election deck against the Trump-Pence ticket.\\u201d\", \"The Jan. 6 committee described the claims in Mr. Navarro\\u2019s report as having been \\u201cdiscredited in public reporting, by state officials and courts.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Navarro said that he made sure Republican members of Congress received a copy of his report and that more than 100 members of Congress had signed onto the plans. (Ultimately, 147 Republican members of Congress objected to certifying at least one state for Mr. Biden.)\", \"\\u201cMy role was very specific in the Green Bay Packers sweep,\\u201d he said in an interview. \\u201cI was the analytical guy who provided the receipts, as Bannon calls it. When the hearings were held and the congressmen were having the debate over the results, they\\u2019d have my report in their hands.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI tried repeatedly to get to Pence,\\u201d Mr. Navarro said, \\u201cand I couldn\\u2019t do it. I was locked out.\\u201d\", \"An aide to Mr. Navarro was also in contact with a group of Trump allies who were pushing for the former president to order the seizure of voting machines.\", \"When the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn and the lawyer Sidney Powell arrived at the White House on Dec. 18 to press Mr. Trump to pursue their plan, they were escorted in by Garrett Ziegler, a young aide to Mr. Navarro, according to Mr. Ziegler\\u2019s account.\", \"Mr. Ziegler\\u2019s credentials were revoked after the incident.\", \"Mr. Navarro is currently defying a subpoena from another congressional investigation. He is refusing to cooperate with a subpoena from the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis.\", \"He said Wednesday he would respond to the Jan. 6 committee\\u2019s subpoena shortly.\", \"More than 500 witnesses have cooperated with the Jan. 6 inquiry so far.\"]","href_hash":"fb32ac7e89f211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fb32ac7e89f211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
