The hit series transformed what a police procedural could look, sound and feel like \\u2014 according to Hollywood lore, the show was pitched as \\u201cMTV cops\\u201d \\u2014 and made Johnson an international star.\", \"But there is another, perhaps less appreciated contribution to Johnson\\u2019s global celebrity, one that predates his recent supporting roles in critically acclaimed films like \\u201cKnives Out\\u201d and TV series like \\u201cWatchmen.\\u201d From 1996 to 2001, he played the title character in \\u201cNash Bridges,\\u201d a CBS police procedural that, like \\u201cVice,\\u201d was set in a gorgeous city (San Francisco) and featured a buddy cop sidekick \\u2014 played this time by Cheech Marin, one half of the stoner comedy duo \\u201cCheech & Chong.\\u201d Twenty years on, Nash remains one of Johnson\\u2019s favorite roles.\", \"\\u201cI liked his nimbleness, how he could be funny one moment and dead cold serious the next,\\u201d Johnson said on a recent afternoon here at the Peninsula hotel. \\u201cAnd I was curious to see if I could capture that kind of lightning in a bottle again.\\u201d\", \"At first blush, a leading role in the two-hour TV movie revival, \\u201cNash Bridges,\\u201d debuting Saturday on USA, may not seem like the most obvious \\u2014 or necessary \\u2014 move for Johnson. But as with many a CBS procedural, the show\\u2019s popularity, and pedigree, belie the relative lack of attention it has received from the chattering classes. At its peak, \\u201cBridges\\u201d had a sweet prime-time slot and a then-and-still-whopping $2 million-an-episode budget, with a weekly audience of more than 8 million viewers. In syndication, the series has found audiences in dozens of countries. And it\\u2019s a trivia lover\\u2019s dream, with origins tracing back to the writer Hunter S. Thompson.\", \"For Johnson, it is also his first time leading a police procedural in two decades. \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t have been so excited about it if I had to write it for someone else,\\u201d he said.\", \"Johnson, who wrote the new movie with Bill Chais and Carlton Cuse, the creator of the original series, spoke candidly about his reasons for revisiting the \\u201990s procedural, in a wide-ranging conversation that also touched upon some of the stories from his younger, wilder days. Those reasons included love, money and the curiosity befitting a man who, at 71, is naturally given to reflections on the ways people change \\u2014 or don\\u2019t \\u2014 over time.\", \"He wanted to know what Nash \\u2014 an amiable police inspector and amateur magician who patrolled San Francisco in an early \\u201970s bright yellow Plymouth Barracuda \\u2014 would be like 20 years down the road. Not that he didn\\u2019t have ideas. Ideas derived, perhaps, from his own experience.\", \"\\u201cI imagine him to still be very fit, and very capable,\\u201d Johnson said of Nash. \\u201cI imagine him to be wiser, and more thoughtful about things.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe would still slap the crap out you,\\u201d he added, using a cruder term. \\u201cBut he\\u2019d think about it first, and make sure it was coming from a good place.\\u201d\", \"The decades since \\u201cVice\\u201d first made Johnson a star, in 1984, have given him plenty of material. They have, in fact, been the stuff of legend \\u2014 not all of which is verifiable, and not all of which he remembers. He married Melanie Griffith (twice), set a world record in powerboat racing and released two hit singles (one with his then-girlfriend Barbra Streisand). There were struggles with substance abuse, stories of women\\u2019s underwear virtually raining from open windows. There was Miami in the \\u201980s.\", \"Along the way, Johnson had five children, including a daughter, Dakota (of the \\u201cFifty Shades\\u201d franchise), who is racking up A-list anecdotes herself these days. More recently, he has undergone a kind of renaissance, transforming himself from a leading man into a versatile character actor, specializing in a kind of winkingly scuzzy, unreconstructed American male in films like \\u201cMachete\\u201d (2010) and \\u201cDjango Unchained\\u201d (2012), and in TV shows like \\u201cEastbound & Down\\u201d (2009-13).\", \"When Johnson first took on the role of Nash Bridges, he had been looking for a change. Despite the structural similarities of \\u201cBridges\\u201d and \\u201cVice,\\u201d its two lead characters were very different. While Sonny skewed toward the tormented and dour, Nash was upbeat and funny, quick with a snappy line. Johnson appreciated the break.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019d just done a stint on \\u2018Miami Vice\\u2019 for five years, and the show and the character had just gotten darker and darker,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAfter a while, it was like, how dark and desolate and without hope can we make Sonny? And I said, \\u2018I\\u2019m not doing that again.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The series began as something of a favor to Thompson, the iconoclastic journalist and writer of \\u201cFear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\\u201d among other books, who was a neighbor and good friend of Johnson\\u2019s in Woody Creek, Colo., at the time.\", \"\\u201cI was hanging out at his house, and he allowed to me that he was broke,\\u201d Johnson said. \\u201cAnd I had this 22-episode commitment at CBS. It was probably 3 a.m. in the morning, and I said, \\u2018Let\\u2019s just conjure up something, and I\\u2019ll take it to CBS and see if we can get it done.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"They sketched out an idea about two off-duty cops hired to protect a senator\\u2019s wife with Tourette Syndrome, called, what else, \\u201cOff Duty.\\u201d Later that day, Johnson looked at what the two had wrought.\", \"\\u201cIt was unmakeable,\\u201d said Johnson, who became an executive producer on the eventual show. The premise was rejiggered into a procedural about two on-duty cops who were always getting into mischief with off-hours, get-rich-quick schemes. Johnson had the writers watch the 1940 screwball comedy \\u201cHis Girl Friday\\u201d to get a taste of the snappy repartee he wanted.\", \"\\u201cWe were still adjusting the tone of the show through the first order of 12 episodes,\\u201d he said. Thompson ended up writing two episodes and making an uncredited cameo as a piano player in the first season.\", \"The show had notable talent above the line. \\u201cBridges\\u201d was the first series Les Moonves greenlit as head of CBS. Cuse, the creator, went on to become a showrunner of \\u201cLost,\\u201d among other series. Writers included Jed Seidel (\\u201cTerriers,\\u201d \\u201cVeronica Mars,\\u201d \\u201cGilmore Girls\\u201d) and Shawn Ryan, the creator of \\u201cThe Shield.\\u201d\", \"Damon Lindelof got his start on \\u201cBridges\\u201d before going on to cocreate \\u201cLost\\u201d and create the acclaimed HBO series \\u201cThe Leftovers\\u201d and \\u201cWatchmen.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI was a writer\\u2019s assistant before \\u2018Nash Bridges,\\u2019\\u201d Lindelof said. \\u201cDon and Carlton gave me my first big-boy job.\\u201d\", \"The show garnered strong ratings for six seasons before being unceremoniously dropped in 2001, the result of a dispute between CBS and Paramount, one of the show\\u2019s producers. The whole thing \\u201cleft a sour taste in my mouth,\\u201d Johnson said.\", \"The new movie, he said, was one way to remedy that. Johnson has a deep, protective love of the character, so much so that when the actor\\u2019s business partners at Village Roadshow, who co-own the rights to \\u201cBridges,\\u201d approached Johnson about reviving the show, he couldn\\u2019t imagine anyone else playing Nash.\", \"\\u201cWhen Michael Mann was going to make \\u2018Miami Vice\\u2019 as a movie, he didn\\u2019t call me, and I didn\\u2019t call him,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut I knew it was a mistake, and a no-win situation for Colin Farrell. Because everybody on the planet identified me with that character.\\u201d\", \"And of course, there were also the financial benefits of bringing back a property that Johnson\\u2019s production company owns a big piece of, including a portion of the original show\\u2019s 122-episode library.\", \"\\u201cIf I didn\\u2019t think there was something worthy here, I wouldn\\u2019t do it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut there\\u2019s no question there was a business component to it.\\u201d He hopes the \\u201cBridges\\u201d movie might eventually lead to a series of some sort, or maybe a run of two-hour specials.\", \"In the revival, we catch up with Nash after 20 years \\u2014 he\\u2019s still charming, still in San Francisco. (\\u201cWe owned the city of San Francisco,\\u201d Marin recalled of the experience of shooting the original. \\u201cIf you\\u2019ve gotta own a city, that\\u2019s the one to own.\\u201d) He and Marin\\u2019s character, Inspector Joe Dominguez, have evolved, but not so much that they aren\\u2019t befuddled by the changes that millennials and the intervening decades have wrought on the department.\", \"Production began in San Francisco in May. Johnson\\u2019s colleagues are quick to talk about what a fun and giving guy he is to work with and for, and the attention to detail he gives to every aspect of the show.\", \"\\u201cHe knows the name of every crew member,\\u201d Marin said.\", \"Others mention his special skills, like his apparently uncanny abilities behind the wheel. For most driving sequences onscreen, the car is placed on a trailer so the actors don\\u2019t need to actually drive; sometimes they\\u2019re shot in a studio using green screens or projectors. The opening scene of the movie, which has Bridges zipping around San Francisco with a discombobulated Marin riding shotgun \\u2014 that\\u2019s all Johnson.\", \"\\u201cDon will hold the car at exactly 40 miles an hour to keep pace with the camera car, while doing a two-minute-long scene of dialogue perfectly,\\u201d said Greg Beeman, a director on both the original \\u201cBridges\\u201d and the new one. \\u201cI\\u2019ve tried it after \\u2018Bridges,\\u2019 and no other actor can do it.\\u201d\", \"What co-workers won\\u2019t do is tell any Don Johnson tales out of school, even those they might have heard thirdhand or seen splashed across a tabloid.\", \"But Johnson will. That story about how he got sent to reform school at the age of 12 after hot-wiring a car? \\u201cYeah, I probably made that up,\\u201d he said. The time he was snorting cocaine in the men\\u2019s bathroom of a club and ran into Jimi Hendrix? \\u201cThat was a club in New York called the Hippopotamus,\\u201d he explained.\", \"Those wild \\u201cVice\\u201d-era parties at Johnson\\u2019s home, where U2 and dozens of models might show up? Well, Johnson couldn\\u2019t go out back then. He was the hottest guy on the planet\\u2019s hottest show, so the party was brought to him.\", \"\\u201cWhat went on behind closed doors, I have no idea,\\u201d he said.\", \"These days, Johnson\\u2019s life is a lot more serene. In addition to his hopes for more \\u201cBridges,\\u201d he has plans to do a film for Netflix, and has other projects in the works that he declined to name.\", \"Johnson can pick and choose projects \\u201cto a certain extent,\\u201d he said, but he still likes to be asked, as he was for \\u201cBridges.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI still like the idea that somebody asked for you,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI like the idea that someone sends a script and says, \\u2018We want Don Johnson to do this.\\u2019\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"179cd9314dd911eca04fcf809600a91b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"179cd9314dd911eca04fcf809600a91b"}},
