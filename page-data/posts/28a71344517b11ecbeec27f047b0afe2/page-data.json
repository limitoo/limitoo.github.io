The rest of the country will be in orange, which allows for larger gatherings but restricts access for those who remain unvaccinated.\", \"From December 15, the Auckland boundary will lift and Aucklanders will be free to travel around the country, despite the ongoing community outbreak in which 23 percent of cases have been children under 12 and 14 percent fully vaccinated.\", \"To travel outside the Auckland boundary, anyone aged 12 or over will need to be fully vaccinated or have had a negative Covid-19 test within three days of departure. This will reduce the number of infected people leaving Auckland, but cases will spread across the country as people travel to see wh\\u0101nau and go on holidays.\", \"As part of our research to build a population-based contagion network, we used electronic transaction data from previous years to derive movement patterns across the country. We show that during weeks without public holidays, just over 100,000 travellers left Auckland to visit one or more other regions.\", \"For the summer period of 2019-2020, close to 200,000 people left Auckland each week, with travel peaking over the Christmas and New Year period. The most common destinations for these trips were Thames-Coromandel (30,000 people), Tauranga (17,000 people) and Northland (15,000 people).\", \"While full (two-dose) vaccination levels in Auckland are almost at 90 percent - remembering that 90 percent of eligible people means only about 75 percent of the total population, with lower rates for M\\u0101ori - rates are much lower in many places Aucklanders like to visit over summer. This provides much less protection, against both illness and transmission, and any outbreak would be larger and more rapid.\", \"Vaccination coverage in these areas is increasing but is unlikely to be at 90 percent before Christmas. Holiday destinations also have health infrastructure designed for the much lower local population and face additional pressures if visitors get sick.\", \"New Zealand's outdoor summer lifestyle might be an advantage; transmission is greatly reduced outdoors with good air movement. But people should remain mindful anytime they move into an environment with less ventilation, such as using the toilet at the beach or sharing a car. A good rule of thumb is if you can smell perfume in the air then there's a transmission risk.\", \"Covid-19 is passed on through the air we breathe, which is why masking remains important, as long as the mask fits properly.\", \"People planning to travel should reduce their risk of exposure during the two weeks before a trip.\"]","href_hash":"28a71344517b11ecbeec27f047b0afe2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"28a71344517b11ecbeec27f047b0afe2"}},
