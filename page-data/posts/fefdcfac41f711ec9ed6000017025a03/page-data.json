So that sits on me without oversight of the judicial system.\\\"\", \"It is usually the police who charge people and then prosecute them for crimes. But the most serious crimes - about 5 percent of all prosecutions - become Crown prosecutions. When they do, the Crown Solicitor can add to the police charges, modify the charges or withdraw them.\", \"This is the power of the Crown Solicitor, and yet Dickey does not work for the government: All of New Zealand's Crown Solicitors are lawyers in private law firms.\", \"Why do we trust the private sector with these decisions?

There's a terrible imbalance here.\\\"\", \"McKinnel wanted to quantify the imbalance.\", \"Private law firms aren't subject to the Official Information Act (OIA), so McKinnel used the OIA to ask Crown Law, the government department which oversees Crown prosecutions, how it ensures Crown Solicitors aren't contributing to bias in the justice system.\", \"But the sleuth, who became a household name after his investigative work helped free Teina Pora from jail for a murder he didn't commit, came back virtually empty handed.\", \"Crown Law said it didn't monitor the ethnicity of defendants and nor did it have internal policies about bias in the criminal justice system.\", \"In the 26-page contract between Crown Law and Crown Solicitors, called the Terms of Office, just two paragraphs are devoted to diversity and the Treaty of Waitangi.\", \"One paragraph says Crown Solicitors are \\\"committed to the values and principles\\\" of the Treaty and will deliver services to reflect that. The other paragraph says \\\"where practicable\\\" Crown Solicitors should try to \\\"reflect the diversity of the community which the warrant serves\\\".\", \"McKinnel didn't ask how many of the Crown Solicitors themselves were M\\u0101ori.\", \"But Crown Law had agreed to an interview with RNZ. Seeing as there are only 16 Crown Solicitors - there are 17 warrants but one solicitor covers the Hawke's Bay and Gisborne regions - we expected Crown Law could easily give us an ethnic breakdown.\", \"***\", \"Deputy Solicitor General Madeleine Laracy has booked Quiet Room No 1 at the Crown Law office, just across the road from Parliament.\", \"Laracy, formerly the chief spy watchdog in her role as acting Inspector General of Intelligence and Security, heads the Criminal Group at Crown Law and is directly responsible for monitoring the Crown Solicitor Network.\", \"She's an enthusiastic and expert advocate for the virtues of the Crown Solicitor system, revelling in its history and gently chiding when she feels its shortcomings are overstated.\", \"But 48 minutes into the interview, when asked the simplest of questions - how many of the Crown Solicitors are M\\u0101ori? - there is a long and unexpected pause.\", \"\\\"I don't know if any of the Crown Solicitors would label themselves as M\\u0101ori,\\\" she eventually responds. \\\"We don't ask that question. We don't have that data. We don't ask them how they identify.\\\"\", \"Since Crown Law doesn't have the data, RNZ decided to collect it for them. Because they are private law firms not subject to the OIA they didn't have to respond but 11 of the 16 did.\", \"The responses showed many were failing to reflect the diversity of their communities. The Crown solicitor firms in Christchurch, Gisborne and Whanganui had no M\\u0101ori prosecutors at all and outside Auckland few firms had more than one.\", \"Interestingly, one of the best performers on diversity is a firm that had to start from scratch when a new Crown warrant was issued for Manukau, breaking the Auckland-wide monopoly enjoyed by Meredith Connell.\", \"Kayes Fletcher Walker was a small criminal defence law firm with three people when Natalie Walker was made the first Crown Solicitor for Manukau in 2015. The firm now has 39 lawyers - 24 are P\\u0101keh\\u0101, six are M\\u0101ori and four are Pasifika. The firm also has prosecutors from China, Sri Lanka, Iraq, Macedonia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\", \"Laracy accepts that there is bias in the criminal justice system - it would be difficult not to, given more than half the prison population is M\\u0101ori despite making up only 16 percent of the general population.\", \"But the way to combat that, Laracy says, is by Crown Solicitors \\\"ensuring that they prosecute impartially and without discrimination\\\".\", \"If a prosecution was driven by discrimination, she says, that would not go unnoticed.\", \"\\\"That's going to show up in the fact that there isn't sufficient evidence and it isn't in the public interest and those concerns should be readily identified in the court process.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/48972/four_col_large_1M1A7963.jpg?1443489120\\\" alt=\\\"Acting Director of GCSB\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nUna Jagose \\nPhoto: RNZ / Alexander Robertson\\n</div>\", \"Maybe. But then as Brian Dickey said, as he recalled his angst over the rape allegation that never went to trial, sometimes a Crown Solicitor's decision is never exposed to the bright lights of the court room.\", \"So who monitors the performance of Crown Solicitors? The short answer is Madeleine Laracy's boss, Solicitor General Una Jagose, the government's chief legal advisor and chief executive of Crown Law.\", \"According to the Terms of Office, the Solicitor General conducts reviews of Crown Solicitors which are \\\"designed to ensure high standards\\\" and \\\"examine the legal acumen and performance\\\".\", \"But Crown Solicitors are only subject to these reviews every three or four years and the public is asked to trust their performance is acceptable without being able to verify that it is.\", \"RNZ asked for copies of the performance reviews but Crown Law wouldn't hand them over, saying they are not subject to the OIA.\", \"Dickey reckons his performance review would stand scrutiny. \\\"In a way I would like you to have it because it is really good,\\\" he says, deploying the deadpan drawl which belies his skill as a prosecutor.\", \"\\\"We're subject to an enormous amount of public scrutiny. We're not subject to this very bespoke particular aspect of public scrutiny,\\\" he says, narrowing the allegation and neutralising it, as if defusing a bomb.\", \"When a case is appealed, the Crown Law office in Wellington goes through the file with a fine-tooth comb, he says.\", \"\\\"It's very hard for an office my size to hide anything in terms of the way that we conduct the public office aspect of being Crown prosecutors.\\\"\", \"***\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/276387/eight_col_210803_MEREDITH-CONNELL_011-169.jpg?1633049791\\\" alt=\\\"Brian Dickey, partner at Meredith Connell and the Crown Solicitor in Auckland.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nBrian Dickey sometimes appears in front of Justice Simon Moore, who held the Crown Warrant before him \\nPhoto: RNZ / Claire Eastham-Farrelly\\n</div>\", \"Dickey clearly takes his role very seriously. He became Crown Solicitor in 2015 after Simon Moore, who worked at Meredith Connell, was appointed a High Court Judge.\", \"Sometimes Dickey can turn up to court and his old mentor is the judge, as he was in the Epiha trial.\", \"For McKinnel it is all a bit too close for comfort. The private law firms are dynasties, he says. The Crown Warrant seems to be handed down through the ages.\", \"\\\"Where's the contestability with the law firm that has held a warrant for 100 years,\\\" he asks. \\\"You can't tell me that that is the free market working. It goes beyond that. These geographic monopolies, these dynasties, have a great deal of power and influence in society.\\\"\", \"If you ask a Crown Solicitor, Crown Law or the government minister responsible for the system about this, you'll end up in a circular argument which effectively boils down to this: We've always held the warrant because we have the expertise. We have the expertise because we've always held the warrant.\", \"The politician at the top of the legal system, Attorney General David Parker, articulates this view most eloquently, or pompously, depending on your view.\", \"\\\"It's perfectly natural [for Crown Warrants to stay with the same firm] because it's the repository of that specialist knowledge that's accrued from working for the Crown through the generations that is imbued in those firms,\\\" Parker says.\", \"\\\"They are effectively a local monopoly. But you deal with the monopoly concern through having regulated prices, not by pretending that you should change it through some sort of competitive tender process.\\\"\", \"When he talks of regulated prices, he means there is a cap on the amount spent on Crown prosecutions each year, currently $41 million. This is divided up among the 17 warrants, based on the volume and complexity of cases.\", \"This bulk funding regime was introduced in 2013 and led to considerable cost savings - a 25 percent reduction, according to a 2016 statement by former Attorney General Chris Finlayson, who presided over the changes.\", \"\\\"We do not pay them on an hourly basis, so if they do more hours, they do more hours. There's no more money,\\\" Laracy says.\", \"But bulk funding may have introduced unintended consequences, according to research by Andrew Britton, who worked as a Crown prosecutor himself.\", \"For his 2018 paper, Pressing for Sentence, An Examination of the New Zealand Crown Prosecutor's Role in Sentencing, Britton spoke to ten Crown prosecutors about the impact of bulk funding, among other issues.\", \"One prosecutor told him the warrant had been \\\"a license to print money\\\" but that changed with bulk funding, and in some firms \\\"equity partners have made decisions that they are not going to take a pay cut - they will just live with having less staff\\\".\", \"More alarming was the suggestion that lawyers in these firms might use plea bargains to clear work off the books.\", \"''I certainly do believe that we will be accepting pleas to lesser charges on less principled bases than we did in the past, to dispose of cases,\\\" one lawyer told him, adding that there was \\\"definitely variation\\\" in how people were charged between different Crown firms.\", \"\\\"There are a lot of suggestions that some people are doing unprincipled resolutions to get things disposed of quicker so that they can get more money,\\\" one lawyer told him.\", \"Laracy is quick to stomp on that idea. \\\"We've seen no evidence of that,\\\" she says. \\\"Theoretically the incentive is there,\\\" but she believes the open court system provides the checks and balances in plea bargaining.\", \"\\\"One of the protections against that is the public nature of prosecutions.

Parker, who has spent 20 years in Parliament and has been Attorney General in two governments, thinks the private law firms provide a healthy buffer, keeping the prosecution function well away from politicians.\", \"\\\"I look at other systems overseas where they have more politicised judiciary and a less hands-off approach and I think they have worse outcomes.\\\"\", \"But prominent defence lawyers and legal academics think the system is ripe for change, and for them it's a matter of principle.\", \"\\\"It's almost like a franchising system when you franchise out the bus services for a particular area.
