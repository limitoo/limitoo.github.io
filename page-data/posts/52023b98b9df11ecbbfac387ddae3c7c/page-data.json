He did not provide other details about her treatment or mental condition.\", \"She is scheduled to be formally arraigned in court next week and both Lori and Chad Daybell are set to stand trial together early next year.\", \"They are charged with conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder in connection with the deaths of Lori Daybell's children 7-year-old Joshua \\\"JJ\\\" Vallow, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan, as well as Chad Daybell's first wife, Tammy Daybell.\", \"Lori Daybell is also charged in Arizona with conspiring to kill her former estranged husband, Charles Vallow, with the help of her now-deceased brother, Alex Cox.\", \"Chad Daybell has pleaded not guilty to the charges and Lori Daybell has not yet had an opportunity to enter a plea. Chad Daybell's attorney, John Prior, declined to comment on the case.
