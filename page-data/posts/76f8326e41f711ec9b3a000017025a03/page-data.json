The standoff has intensified a long-simmering confrontation between Belarus, a repressive former Soviet republic, and the E.U., which includes Poland, and raised new security concerns for the European bloc.\", \"Western officials accuse Aleksandr Lukashenko, Belarus\\u2019s leader, of intentionally trying to create a new migrant crisis in Europe in an act of retaliation against sanctions imposed after his disputed 2020 election victory. Human rights groups said Poland was illegally pushing migrants who had crossed the border back into Belarusian territory.\", \"The sharp increase in tensions has rattled European officials, with images of desperate migrants evoking the refugee crisis of 2015. Leaders are now scrambling to strike a balance between protecting the bloc\\u2019s external borders and preventing a worsening humanitarian crisis among the migrants camped along the edge of a forest in freezing weather.\", \"Details: At least 3,000 people who hoped to enter the E.U. gathered yesterday near the Kuznica border crossing, near the Belarusian city of Grodno, Polish officials said. In response, Poland increased its forces in the area to more than 17,000 soldiers, border guards and police officers.\", \"Reporting: Poland has prevented journalists, aid organizations and E.U. officials from traveling to the border area, making reports from the scene difficult to verify. The Polish authorities said eight people had died trying to cross the border.\", \"African nations face a big question: Who gets to keep using fossil fuels, and for how long, during the transition to clean energy?\", \"As world leaders meet at COP26 in Glasgow, some African leaders and activists are vocally opposing a speedier pivot to renewables for their countries. Though a swift transition is crucial in the global fight against climate change, it would be particularly costly for poorer nations, they argue, especially those with an abundance of natural gas or other fossil fuels.\", \"Instead, they are pressing for a slower transition, one that would embrace a continued reliance on fossil fuels \\u2014 particularly natural gas, which burns more cleanly than coal or oil, but which still pumps planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Wealthier nations would lead the way and then transfer technical knowledge on renewables to Africa later on.\", \"Quotable: \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing to cut here,\\u201d Titus Gwemende, the climate director at the Open Society Foundation, a grant organization, said of Africa\\u2019s emissions. \\u201cAfrican countries are the ones on the receiving end of this problem. It\\u2019s the bigger emitters that should have the responsibility to cut.\\u201d\", \"People in France over the age of 65 will now have to get booster shots to remain eligible for vaccine passports that are needed to gain access to many public places, Emmanuel Macron, the country\\u2019s president, announced yesterday. The new rule takes effect Dec. 15.\", \"\\u201cVaccinate yourself so that you can lead a normal life,\\u201d Macron implored those who had still not gotten their first shot. He added, \\u201cBeing free in a nation like France entails being responsible and showing solidarity. I\\u2019m therefore counting on you.\\u201d\", \"Since the pandemic began, 119,000 people in France have lost their lives to Covid-19. The country now has one of the world\\u2019s highest vaccination rates, with 69 percent fully vaccinated. But new cases have been increasing in recent weeks, as have hospital admissions. The W.H.O. warned last week that Europe was back at the center of the pandemic.\", \"Context: Though billed as an address on the pandemic, Macron\\u2019s 27-minute speech resembled a campaign declaration, as the president summarized what he considered his accomplishments and listed his goals for a potential second term. Macron is leading in the polls ahead of the election next April.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"At one hospital in Alaska, a state hit hard by Covid, Indigenous foods are part of the healing plan. Seal soup, caribou stew and other traditional dishes are prepared for patients who are often hundreds of miles from home.\", \"Two years ago, the Times Magazine published \\u201cThe 1619 Project: A New Origin Story,\\u201d a project led by the journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones that made the bold claim that the moment in August 1619 when the first enslaved Africans arrived in the English colonies could be considered the origin date of what would become the U.S.\", \"\\u201cThe reasoning behind this is simple: Enslavement is not marginal to the history of the United States; it is inextricable,\\u201d writes Jake Silverstein, the editor of the magazine. \\u201cSo many of our traditions and institutions were shaped by slavery, and so many of our persistent racial inequalities stem from its enduring legacy.\\u201d\", \"That claim prompted significant pushback from some and a profoundly enthusiastic response from others. The project is now a book, and it arrives amid a prolonged debate over how American history is taught. \\u201cNo matter how diligent the work has been, the book will kick up a new round of debates,\\u201d Jake writes.\", \"Read more about the 1619 Project.\", \"This caramelized shallot pasta is ideal for a cool fall evening.\", \"In \\u201cThe Dawn of Everything,\\u201d the anthropologist David Graeber and the archaeologist David Wengrow aim to rewrite the story of our shared past \\u2014 and future.\", \"Our testers have yet to find a better house shoe than these ultra-durable felted-wool slippers, designed in Denmark.\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: Home to the highest and lowest points on earth\\u2019s surface (four letters).\", \"And here is the Spelling Bee.\", \"You can find all our puzzles here.\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing.
