Dr. Califf is familiar to most members of the Senate: He had been F.D.A. commissioner in the last year of the Obama administration, confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 89-to-4.\", \"If confirmed this time around, Dr. Califf would assume command of an agency that has been led on an interim basis by Dr. Janet Woodcock for nearly a year. It is unlikely that he would be confirmed before 2022, as the United States heads into its third pandemic year and anticipates vaccines for children younger than 5 and new Covid-19 treatments.\", \"During the Trump administration, the agency came under scrutiny for caving in to political pressure as the pandemic unfolded. A flurry of decisions that allowed questionable treatments and other products to flood the market stirred concerns. Dr. Califf would also inherit frustrations over the cost and scarcity of rapid tests, the challenges posed by a mutating coronavirus and a demoralized staff. At the hearing, Dr. Califf said emergency preparedness and response would be his first priority, but he offered few specifics.\", \"Members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions expressed satisfaction with the agency\\u2019s pandemic response so far. Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the panel\\u2019s ranking Republican member, said the next commissioner could \\u201cnot take their foot off the gas.\\u201d\", \"Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat who led the hearing, said she received 13 letters of support for Dr. Califf from 90 signatories, including six former agency commissioners.\", \"The Senate hearing grew emotional when some members delved into the devastating toll wrought by the opioid epidemic. Fatalities are at a historic peak, with 100,000 deaths through the 12 months that ended in April. Critics in Congress are bitter over the agency\\u2019s handling of the potent painkillers.\", \"Even before the hearing, Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat whose state has felt the drug crisis acutely, announced on Tuesday that he would oppose Dr. Califf\\u2019s confirmation, noting that opioid deaths have only mounted since Dr. Califf\\u2019s previous term as commissioner. In 2016, Senator Manchin delayed and voted against Dr. Califf, citing the same concerns that Dr. Califf would do little to curb the opioid epidemic.\", \"\\u201cIt is abundantly clear the F.D.A. has failed to keep Americans safe,\\u201d Senator Manchin said in a statement on Tuesday. \\u201cHow many more Americans have to die before we see a culture change at the F.D.A.? If there was ever a time for a change in leadership at the F.D.A., an institution with such direct impact on the American people, it is now.\\u201d\", \"Another senator, Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, said he had \\u201cgrave reservations\\u201d about Dr. Califf\\u2019s nomination. He had voted against him five years ago, too.\", \"At the hearing, Senator Maggie Hassan, a New Hampshire Democrat, criticized the agency for failing to change opioid policies as the death toll soared for years. She called for an overhaul of opioid medication labeling. Senator Ben Ray Luj\\u00e1n, a Democrat from New Mexico, expressed outrage about the 2013 approval of the medication Zohydro, which was authorized over the objection of an agency advisory committee.\", \"\\u201cSomething\\u2019s got to change,\\u201d Senator Luj\\u00e1n said. \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m hoping, doctor, that you can be that person.\\u201d\", \"The senators\\u2019 concerns drew a pledge from Dr. Califf that he would undertake a \\u201ccomprehensive review\\u201d of the agency\\u2019s opioid policies if he were confirmed. He said he would look at options for addressing the crisis, including a change to the labeling of opioid medications. \\u201cIf I\\u2019m confirmed, I\\u2019m going to take a very aggressive approach on this,\\u201d he said.\", \"The hearing concluded without a vote. The panel will take one at a later date, and that would be a precursor to a full vote in the Senate, which has not yet been set. Dr. Califf\\u2019s earlier stint as commissioner lasted nearly a year, until President Donald J. Trump was sworn into office.\", \"Dr. Califf\\u2019s other experience at the agency as deputy commissioner for medical products and tobacco may help guide him as the agency considers how to proceed with new vaping products and whether to allow Juul to stay on the market. The F.D.A. recently authorized an electronic cigarette to be sold in the United States, a decision that weighed the benefits of helping some adults quit smoking against the risk of youth addiction. Dr. Califf described the level of youth vaping as an \\u201calarming rate,\\u201d noting that the appointment of a new leader of the agency\\u2019s tobacco unit would be a key decision.\", \"The agency has a role in approving and ensuring the safety of an array of products, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, medical devices, food and tobacco products. It touches on goods that account for 20 cents of every dollar Americans spend.\", \"Another issue at Tuesday\\u2019s hearing, raised by Republican lawmakers, was the F.D.A.\\u2019s imminent decision on mifepristone, the first of two drugs given to terminate a pregnancy in the initial 10 weeks of gestation. The abortion drug had been highly restricted by the F.D.A., which for years required it to be dispensed to patients in person by specially certified medical providers.\", \"In April, the F.D.A. temporarily lifted the in-person requirement for the duration of the pandemic, writing in a letter to doctors\\u2019 groups that a review of medical literature showed few adverse events from the treatment and noting the risk of Covid-19 transmission during office visits. The letter, signed by Dr. Woodcock, allowed dispensing through the mail, making it easier for patients to get the pills. Biden administration officials have been concerned that Republicans\\u2019 objections to that decision could strengthen opposition to Dr. Califf\\u2019s nomination.\", \"\\u201cI can assure you the staff will be looking at the latest data and apply the best science and make the best possible decision,\\u201d Dr. Califf told the Senate panel. \\u201cI have confidence in that staff and I know them well.\\u201d\", \"Throughout the hearing, Dr. Califf emphasized the importance of generating and relying on thorough data and using it to advance therapies that work and abandon those that fail. He outlined his contributions as a researcher to cardiology drug and device development that had \\u201chelped millions of Americans.\\u201d He said, \\u201cI learned firsthand that it is essential that we produce high-quality evidence to sort the effective and ineffective treatments.\\u201d\", \"But Dr. Califf\\u2019s career was also held up as an example of the \\u201crevolving door\\u201d nature of the agency, where officials one day are regulating major drug and device companies and upon leaving, accepting lucrative jobs in the industry. Since Dr. Califf left his post as F.D.A. commissioner, he has shifted from mostly academic leadership at Duke University to executive and consulting roles with pharmaceutical and biotech companies.\", \"Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, noted that nine out of the last 10 F.D.A. commissioners went on to work for or served on boards of directors in the pharmaceutical industry.\", \"\\u201cUnfortunately, Dr. Califf, you are not the exception to that rule,\\u201d Senator Sanders said, asking how the American people can \\u201cfeel comfortable you\\u2019re going to stand up to this powerful special interest.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI have a history of doing that,\\u201d Dr. Califf replied, noting that he agreed to comply with the agency\\u2019s ethics pledge.\", \"In May 2017, Dr. Califf joined Verily, the life sciences arm of Google, and reported $2.7 million in income and between $1 million and $5 million in stock from his role as head of clinical policy and strategy, according to an ethics disclosure. In another government ethics filing, he said he would resign from the position upon confirmation.\", \"Dr. Califf\\u2019s pledges to modernize the F.D.A., though, echo arguments of his supporters, who say working in the industry provides critical knowledge and insight into lifesaving technology. He nodded to his recent experience in technocrat medicine, repeatedly invoking the need for better data to guide decision making.\", \"\\u201cAll F.D.A.\\u2019s actions regarding the products the agency regulates must focus on protecting consumers and patients,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSafety matters.\\u201d\", \"His income disclosure indicated that he retired in November 2019 from Duke University, where he had been a tenured professor and founding director of the Duke Clinical Research Institute. He continued to serve as an adjunct professor, but said he would resign from that role as well if confirmed.\", \"Dr. Califf also said that he would resign from leadership roles at pharmaceutical and biotech firms, divest his stock and refrain from direct decision-making related to companies where he served as a compensated board director. He was awarded more than $1 million in unvested stock options as a board director of Centessa Pharmaceuticals, the disclosure shows, some of which will be \\u201caccelerated\\u201d so he can cash them out; other shares will be forfeited. The company is working on therapies for hemophilia, narcolepsy and other conditions. He earned at least another $850,000 from stock options in Cytokinetics Inc., a South San Francisco company developing therapies for people with impaired muscle function.\", \"He also reported owning $250,001 to $500,000 in stock in Amgen and Bristol-Myers Squibb and $100,001 to $250,000 in Gilead Sciences Inc., which he pledged to divest if confirmed. BMS has a Covid treatment in the pipeline, and Gilead has an approved antiviral treatment.\"]","href_hash":"2e7d9e095d3511ec8ad473d8ff7b646b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2e7d9e095d3511ec8ad473d8ff7b646b"}},
