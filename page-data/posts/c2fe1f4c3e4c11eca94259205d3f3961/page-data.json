","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-05T07:27:30.000Z","content":"[\"Training for a marathon two years ago, I ran so fast, I couldn\\u2019t believe the clock. It felt like I was lying.\", \"Now when I trudge down those same paths where I took my limits and beat them, I\\u2019m a little wistful. It feels like a beautiful dream.\", \"I\\u2019m not a professional runner \\u2014 it\\u2019s something I do as a hobby, and it has been a rewarding one. For the 15 years I\\u2019ve raced marathons, I mostly got faster each time.\", \"But when I got an email a few weeks ago confirming I had qualified for an elite start I\\u2019d coveted in the New York City Marathon \\u2014 with a time logged just before the pandemic \\u2014 my excitement quickly turned to dread. This Sunday, I\\u2019ll probably run the slowest marathon of my life.\", \"With everything else that\\u2019s happened since my last marathon, I haven\\u2019t put in the kind of obsessive work that goes into training. Getting slower is easy to ignore when you\\u2019re jogging alone without a watch, as I\\u2019ve done for much of the past year. But my 26-mile tour of New York will clarify things quite a bit.\", \"Still, I want to do it. I haven\\u2019t run this race in almost a decade, even though I\\u2019ve lived roughly two miles from the finish the whole time. After last year\\u2019s pandemic cancellation, this 50th running of the race will be historic. Healthy. Hopefully also fun.\", \"I\\u2019m 37 and I\\u2019ve spent so much of my life convinced that not moving forward automatically meant sliding back. Running was an easy way to measure that. I worried that any slower time wasn\\u2019t just another valley before a new peak, but that it foretold a deterioration I was determined to defy.\", \"I\\u2019m not the only one who struggles with this. Regarding a phenomenon he called \\u201csuccess addiction\\u201d in The Atlantic last year, Arthur Brooks, a Harvard professor, explained, \\u201cThough it isn\\u2019t a conventional medical addiction, for many people success has addictive properties.\\u201d Success stimulates the neurotransmitter dopamine, which keeps you coming back for more. Psychologists call it the \\u201chedonic treadmill,\\u201d where you get so caught up in the relentless pursuit of success that you put it before everything, even happiness. The faster you go, the harder it is to jump off.\", \"My hedonic treadmill was racing. It became a symbol of my trajectory in most other areas of life as well: work, relationships, health. The satisfaction and pride my highs have brought me were real. But it started to be as much about coveting those highs as fearing the lows.\", \"Sometimes it feels like I\\u2019m racing the ghost of my former self. I\\u2019ve outrun her for so long that I don\\u2019t know what to do with the fact that now she might finally be closing in.\", \"This marathon feels like a test of whether I can handle that. I\\u2019ve never been more uncertain about the future than I am now. But I have learned one thing. Over the past two years, in almost every part of my life, I\\u2019ve had no choice but to slow down \\u2014 and the world didn\\u2019t end, as I feared.\", \"Like many others, I\\u2019m ending this year realizing the life I had before the pandemic isn\\u2019t waiting for me on the other side. We all lost a lot. It\\u2019s time to figure out what to do with what\\u2019s left.\", \"Shalane Flanagan, one of the best runners America has produced, is trying to figure this out, too. Ms. Flanagan, who won the 2017 New York City Marathon with a time of 2 hours 26 minutes, emerged from a career-ending double knee surgery two years ago and set out to race six marathons, each in under three hours, this fall.\", \"She\\u2019ll be running among us commoners instead of the pros, if still faster than almost all of us, in the five boroughs on Sunday. At age 40, her times may be slower than her best, but they are still extraordinary. In reclaiming her sport on her own terms, Ms. Flanagan has taken the dusk of retirement and turned it into a dazzling sunset.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve had a lot more fun this way,\\u201d she told me. \\u201cI dip my toe into being uncomfortable, but not so much that I can\\u2019t soak up what\\u2019s going on around me, which I couldn\\u2019t do when I had almost laser beam tunnel vision as a professional.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBy dialing back just a little bit, it\\u2019s like a completely different sport to me now,\\u201d she continued. \\u201cIt\\u2019s liberating. I don\\u2019t have to meet anyone\\u2019s expectations but mine.\\u201d\", \"It has also felt different for me, to \\u201cjog\\u201d instead of \\u201ctrain.\\u201d The rigidity is gone. Sometimes when I get back from my regular running loop, my partner asks whether I did a long run. No, I tell him, I\\u2019m just a little slower, so it takes a little longer. But I\\u2019m healthy. I\\u2019m fast enough. I\\u2019m less injured than I\\u2019ve been probably since I was 12.\", \"It takes courage to accept where you are now, to resist trying to force yourself back to what you once were. As great as it feels to peak, eventually we crest and then descend. Whether that\\u2019s now or later, we\\u2019ll all get there, and that\\u2019s fine. The ghost of my former self may still try to haunt me, but she\\u2019s no longer a rival I have to beat. Everything she has is mine, too.\", \"On Sunday, I\\u2019m going to wake myself up before dawn. I\\u2019m going to tear through Central Park like I\\u2019m running the best race of my life. When people cheer for me, I\\u2019m going to cheer back. I\\u2019m going to cross the finish line as if I won. And when I see my ghost sprinting up ahead of me, I will smile.\"]","href_hash":"c2fe1f4c3e4c11eca94259205d3f3961"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c2fe1f4c3e4c11eca94259205d3f3961"}},
