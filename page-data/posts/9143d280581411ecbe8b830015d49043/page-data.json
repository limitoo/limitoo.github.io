Discussions about the most appropriate response have been ongoing for months.\", \"China is seeking to both discourage and preempt boycotts by warning against the \\\"politicization of sport.\\\" It has also threatened unspecified \\\"countermeasures\\\" should anyone take the symbolic step to protest Beijing's actions during a sensitive period for the reputation and legitimacy of the Chinese leadership, including Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, who will expect a successful Winter Games to propel him toward an unprecedented third term in office next fall.\", \"Many capitals may opt out of a coordinated diplomatic boycott for fear of embarrassing and therefore antagonizing the Chinese government; others may quietly downgrade their Olympic delegation and not send any senior representatives at all while choosing not to publicize the decision for similar reasons.\", \"Here is the growing list of countries that are using Beijing 2022 to take a very public stand against the People's Republic of China's (PRC) controversial policies.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947490/every-country-boycotting-beijing-2022-winter-olympics.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">File: The logo for the 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Game in Beijing is unveiled on December 15, 2017.</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">United States</div>\", \"The U.S.'s diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Games was officially confirmed by White House press secretary Jen Psaki on December 6.\", \"\\\"The Biden administration will not send any diplomatic or official representation to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games given the PRC's ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and other human rights abuses,\\\" Psaki said.\", \"\\\"U.S. diplomatic or official representation would treat these games as business as usual in the face of the PRC's egregious human rights abuses and atrocities in Xinjiang. And we simply can't do that.\\\"\", \"The government-level boycott means it doesn't extend to athletes. Team USA has been clear about its desire for American sportspersons to compete in Beijing when the competition opens on February 4. Psaki said they would have the White House's \\\"full support.\\\"\", \"The idea of a diplomatic boycott is not new. It was floated as far back as May by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who riled Chinese officials with her suggestion at the time.\", \"Following Psaki's confirmation, the State Department said it expected more countries to announce their decision \\\"in the coming days and weeks.\\\" Meanwhile, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the U.S. would \\\"pay a price\\\" for its decision.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Lithuania</div>\", \"The Baltic nation was technically the first to publicly confirm its intention to boycott Beijing 2022 at an official level.

He said the decision was made after considering a \\\"range of factors,\\\" chief among them logistical constraints associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\", \"He said the decision was relayed to the Chinese government in October, with New Zealand athletes expected to receive support from diplomatic staff.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Scotland</div>\", \"Scotland's Sport Minister Maree Todd confirmed the country's planned diplomatic boycott in a written response to Scottish parliamentarian Ross Greer on December 7.\", \"Todd said: \\\"The Scottish Government continues to be deeply concerned by reports of serious, widespread and systemic human rights abuses committed against members of the Uyghur and other minority ethnic communities in Xinjiang, as well as by China's overall record of human rights violations, including in Tibet and in Hong Kong.\\\"\", \"No Scottish ministers or government officials will be present at the Olympics in Beijing next February, she said.
