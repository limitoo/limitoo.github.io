The 30-year-old was very excited about the job when he was first hired. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"I was ecstatic. I was. I told everybody that day. I called my mom. I told my wife, was happy,\\\" Lucius told \\\"CBS Mornings\\\" co-host Tony Dokoupil.\\u00a0\", \"But while many line workers at Kellogg's still have pensions, premium healthcare and great wages, other workers like Lucius get less\\u2014no pensions, pricier healthcare and less pay than colleagues who do the exact same job.\\u00a0\", \"Lucius said he makes $15 less than some of the coworkers he works alongside with. He said that there are two classes of workers at Kellogg's and he is in the lower class.\\u00a0\", \"Kellogg's operates on a two-tier contract system. Since the 1980s, companies in dozens of industries have used it to cut costs by lowering pay for new hires like Lucius. \\u00a0\", \"Lucius believes if he could receive the same money that some of his coworkers receive, he'd be able to buy a house and start putting money into his children's college savings.\\u00a0\", \"In a statement to CBS News, Kellogg's notes \\\"the union agreed to a two-tiered system in 2015,\\\" which the company says is \\\"not unusual in any industry as a way to control rising benefits costs.\\\" \\u00a0\", \"Rick Wartzman from the Drucker Institute said that's both true and the problem.\", \"\\\"America was more of a 'we' culture, and in more recent decades I think we've become an 'I' culture,\\\" Wartzman said.\", \"In his book, \\\"The End of Loyalty: The Rise and Fall of Good Jobs in America,\\\" Wartzman details why wages for the typical worker rose right alongside productivity after World War II.

It's a huge deal. Tony, this last, you know, 40-50 year period, we have left so many people trailing so far behind,\\\" Wartzman said. He blames familiar changes like automating jobs and moving them overseas.\\u00a0\", \"But he also points to a less appreciated change: a shift in the culture of the business itself, tying CEO pay to the stock price and valuing investors ahead of everyone else.\", \"\\\"So, there's a real, frankly, personal incentive for all too many to try and do all kinds of things to see the share price go up and worry a lot less about those on the front lines,\\\" Wartzman said.\", \"\\u00a0Work at all of Kellogg Co.'s U.S. cereal plants came to a halt in October after workers went on strike.\\u00a0\", \"Along with \\\"transitional employees\\\" like Lucius, on the picket line include Kellogg's workers considered \\\"legacy employees\\\" \\u00a0who have been grandfathered into a better deal. \\u00a0\", \"Among those on the picket line include Kellogg's workers who are considered \\\"legacy employees\\\" and have been grandfathered into a better deal. \\u00a0\", \"One worker said she is striking because she wants her niece and nephews to have what she has. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"We're doing it for the next generation,\\\" another person said.\\u00a0\", \"But with many everyday Americans fed up, the question is: Where can they really go?\\u00a0\", \"Among the 10 jobs that will add the most positions in America this decade are: home health aides, fast food workers and general laborers \\u2013 with a median salary of just over $30,000.
