Trump under oath in a civil fraud investigation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, an unusual move that comes at a critical juncture in a parallel criminal investigation into the former president.\", \"Ms. James, whose office is also participating in the criminal investigation being run by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., wants to question Mr. Trump on Jan. 7 as part of her separate civil inquiry into his business practices.\", \"If Ms. James finds evidence of wrongdoing in the civil inquiry, she could file a lawsuit against Mr. Trump, but she could not file criminal charges.\", \"Her request comes as Mr. Vance is pushing to determine whether Mr. Trump or his family business, the Trump Organization, engaged in criminal fraud by intentionally submitting false property values to potential lenders. Mr. Vance, a Democrat, did not seek re-election and is leaving office at the end of the year. He will be succeeded by Alvin Bragg, a former federal prosecutor elected in November.\", \"And because the two investigations overlap \\u2014 both Ms. James and Mr. Vance have been focused on whether Mr. Trump inflated his property values to secure financing, and their offices are working together on the criminal inquiry \\u2014 Mr. Trump could refuse to sit for a deposition once Ms. James formally subpoenas him. Ronald P. Fischetti, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said in a brief interview on Thursday that he would ask a judge to quash the subpoena.\", \"Mr. Trump\\u2019s lawyers are likely to argue that the former president\\u2019s testimony could be unfairly used against him in the criminal investigation, violating the constitutional right against self-incrimination. If a judge sided with Ms. James, Mr. Trump could invoke his Fifth Amendment right and decline to respond to questions.\", \"Still, while that decision could not be used against Mr. Trump in the criminal investigation, it might harm him in Ms. James\\u2019s civil inquiry. Jurors are barred from inferring anything from a defendant\\u2019s refusal to testify in a criminal case, but the same is not true in a civil inquiry, where Mr. Trump\\u2019s silence could be used against him.\", \"News of the move came just hours before Ms. James, a Democrat who had announced a run for governor in New York, said that she would instead seek re-election as state attorney general.\", \"\\u201cI have come to the conclusion that I must continue my work as attorney general,\\u201d she said in a statement. \\u201cThere are a number of important investigations and cases that are underway, and I intend to finish the job.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Trump has repeatedly referred to both the criminal and the civil investigations as politically motivated witch hunts and has denied all wrongdoing.\", \"Mr. Fischetti said that the news of Ms. James\\u2019s request had not come as a surprise.\", \"\\u201cThis is what the A.G. has been doing, working hand in glove with the D.A.\\u2019s office,\\u201d he said, implying that Ms. James\\u2019s decision was political and noting that she intended to seek re-election.\", \"Danny Frost, a spokesman for Mr. Vance, said that Ms. James\\u2019s request was \\u201cnot part of the criminal investigation.\\u201d He declined to elaborate and would not say whether Ms. James\\u2019s office had notified Mr. Vance\\u2019s prosecutors about the request to question Mr. Trump.\", \"A spokesman for Ms. James, whose attempt to question the former president was first reported by The Washington Post, declined to comment.\", \"Bruce Green, who directs a center for legal ethics at Fordham University, said in an interview that it was typical for civil investigations to defer to criminal inquiries. Ms. James\\u2019s actions, he said, might suggest she wants to put her investigation on a firm footing in case the criminal inquiry does not result in charges.\", \"\\u201cYou don\\u2019t want to forgo doing the civil investigation on the theory that the prosecutors are going to indict, and then they don\\u2019t,\\u201d Mr. Green said.\", \"The criminal investigation, which is focused on Mr. Trump\\u2019s statements about the value of his assets, has proceeded in fits and starts for more than three years and is reaching a crucial phase toward the end of Mr. Vance\\u2019s tenure.\", \"Over the last several months, the investigators have issued subpoenas for records about Mr. Trump\\u2019s properties, and interviewed a banker employed by the former president\\u2019s top lender, Deutsche Bank.\", \"Ms. James\\u2019s civil investigation into Mr. Trump, which has been underway since March 2019, is focused on some of the same strands as the criminal investigation being overseen by Mr. Vance, and has included scrutiny of similar properties, including Mr. Trump\\u2019s Seven Springs Estate in Westchester County.\", \"Last winter, Ms. James was able to obtain a number of documents relating to the inquiry after a judge twice rejected Mr. Trump\\u2019s attempts to block their release. Some of the documents were relevant to a conservation easement at the Seven Springs property.\", \"Ms. James was examining then whether the easement \\u2014 a legal agreement meant to protect a land\\u2019s conservation value \\u2014 was legitimate and whether the Trump Organization had improperly valued the estate, allowing it a $21 million tax deduction to which it should not have been entitled.\", \"Over the course of the investigation, Ms. James\\u2019s prosecutors have also scrutinized some of Mr. Trump\\u2019s other financial transactions, including the restructuring of the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago in 2010.\", \"If Mr. Trump is deposed next year, it would be the second time he has been questioned under oath since leaving office. In October, he was questioned for hours in connection with a lawsuit filed by a group of demonstrators who said Mr. Trump\\u2019s bodyguards had attacked them outside Trump Tower in 2015.\", \"That deposition has not yet been released, and it is not clear when it might become public.\"]","href_hash":"d4f89cc85a0711ecaf71a7ac31b65752"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d4f89cc85a0711ecaf71a7ac31b65752"}},
