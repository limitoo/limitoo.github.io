It was the latest abrupt change to the International Space Station\\u2019s operations since Russia blew up one of its old satellites in space earlier this month.\", \"Tom Marshburn and Kayla Barron, two U.S. astronauts who arrived at the orbital outpost earlier this month, were scheduled to don their spacesuits and scale the laboratory\\u2019s exterior at 7:10 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday. Their mission of about six hours was to replace a broken communications antenna.\", \"A NASA flight director at the agency\\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston was alerted to a space debris threat Monday evening by U.S. Space Command, which tracks thousands of objects in orbit. NASA later canceled the spacewalk \\u201cdue to the lack of opportunity to properly assess the risk it could pose to the astronauts,\\u201d it said in a statement early Tuesday morning.\", \"NASA finished its assessment of the risk Tuesday afternoon and deemed Thursday a safer opportunity for the spacewalk, Gary Jordan, a NASA spokesman, said in an email. But Mr. Jordan could not indicate whether the debris was related to the Russian antisatellite missile test, saying \\u201cthere is not enough information available to further characterize the debris at this time.\\u201d\", \"A spokeswoman for the U.S. Space Command did not immediately answer questions for comment.\", \"The postponement comes two weeks after Russia struck a defunct Soviet-era satellite with an antisatellite missile, spawning thousands of untraceable smithereens that could remain in orbit for decades. The widening field of hazardous space debris created new threats to the space station and could jeopardize other satellites in orbit.\", \"Mark Vande Hei, a NASA astronaut on the space station, checked in with mission control in Houston on Monday after waking up to an email that showed the spacewalk had been canceled.\", \"\\u201cSorry for the news,\\u201d a NASA official in Houston replied to Mr. Vande Hei over the ground-to-space channel. \\u201cWe\\u2019re probably almost as disappointed as the crew members today, but I know it\\u2019s a little bit harder for you guys waking up to this news.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s just real life, this is how things work out sometimes, and I\\u2019m really glad people are looking out for our safety,\\u201d Mr. Vande Hei said.\", \"The initial debris cloud from the Russian satellite strike came dangerously close to the space station, which housed a crew of seven astronauts, including two from Russia. A NASA mission control official in Houston abruptly awoke the agency\\u2019s astronauts soon after the strike, urging them to take shelter in their spacecraft in case they needed to return to Earth. The crew kept certain hatches on the station closed for days following the incident and opened them when the immediate danger had abated.\", \"The weapon test, carried out by Russia\\u2019s Ministry of Defense, occurred at a moment of heightened tensions between the United States and Russia, as U.S. officials have warned allies that Moscow is building a military presence on its border with Ukraine. And the safety threats to the space station posed by the missile test also occurred as NASA is negotiating with Roscosmos, Russia\\u2019s space agency, to trade astronaut rides to the International Space Station on U.S. vehicles for seats on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Officials from both countries consider such arrangements key to maintaining operations on the space station.\", \"\\u201cThere are about 1,700 new objects, larger objects that are being tracked,\\u201d Dana Weigel, NASA\\u2019s deputy manager of the space station, said on Monday during a news conference that previewed the scheduled spacewalk. \\u201cIt will take a few months to get all of those cataloged and into our normal debris tracking process, where we can then assess miss distances and how close these items get to the I.S.S.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Weigel said that the Russian weapon test doubled the size of the background debris environment for the space station. She said that the new field of wreckage raised the risk to spacewalking astronauts by about 7 percent. But she said that \\u201cfalls within the family\\u201d of similar risk calculations for past spacewalks.\", \"The Russian missile test, which lifted off from the Plesetsk launch site, roughly 650 miles north of Moscow, angered U.S. officials and drew condemnation from other countries, including Australia, Canada and Britain.\", \"Bill Nelson, NASA\\u2019s administrator, said shortly after the test that it was \\u201cpitiful that the Russians would do this.\\u201d\", \"The spacewalk delay came a day before the White House will convene the first meeting of the National Space Council during the Biden administration. In a letter sent to the council on Monday, lawmakers on the Senate Commerce Committee urged Vice President Kamala Harris, the council\\u2019s chairwoman, to act on the Russian antisatellite test and \\u201cwork to develop international dialogue on norms of responsible behavior in space.\\u201d\", \"There have been a dozen spacewalks this year, many of which added new components and solar panels to the space station\\u2019s exterior. NASA intends to keep the 21-year-old orbital laboratory running until 2030, pending congressional approval. But the station has already shown signs of its age, like cracks and air leaks that were discovered on a key module in 2019.\"]","href_hash":"b136317253d311ec851b696ad64907c9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b136317253d311ec851b696ad64907c9"}},
