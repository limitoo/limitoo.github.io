She said: \\\"I'm running for Governor because opportunity in our state shouldn't be determined by zip code, background or access to power,\\\", posting an announcement video with the slogan \\\"We are One Georgia.\\\"\", \"Georgia, historically a red state, backed a Democrat in the presidential election in 2020 for the first time since 1992. Georgia also saw two runoff elections won by the Democrats in January 2021, giving them control of the Senate.\", \"Since losing to Kemp in 2018, Abrams' profile has increased as a voting rights activist and she has been widely credited as influencing the Democrats' wins in the state in 2020 and 2021 by boosting voter turnout, especially among people of color.\", \"Her campaign for governor will be able to attract millions, but the situation today is very different to what it was at the start of the year.

I'll beat her again, but it will be hard to do with Brian Kemp, because the MAGA [Make America Great Again] base will just not vote for him what he did with respect to Election Integrity and two horribly run elections, for President and then two Senate seats.\\\"\", \"Former Georgia Senator David Perdue, who lost re-election to Democratic Sen.
