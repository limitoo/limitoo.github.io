By Monday, that average had dropped slightly to $4.711, more than $1 above the national average of $3.394.\", \"Gas prices have exceeded $5 per gallon in some parts of California, with an average cost of $5.664 reported in Mono County on Monday, AAA data showed.\", \"Gas costs in Los Angeles County also set new records over the weekend, with the area reporting new record prices three times over one week, according to KABC-TV.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1941602/gas-prices-california.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Average gasoline prices continue to rise in California even as national averages began to stabilize near the end of November.

Gas prices already tend to be higher in California because of state taxes imposed on gasoline purchases. The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration set the state's current excise gasoline tax at just over 51 cents per gallon, with other state and federal taxes bringing the total tax for a gallon of gas to 85.38 cents, according to the American Petroleum Institute. These combined taxes are higher than the gas taxes collected in any other state, the institute's data shows.\", \"In addition to high state taxes, fees collected through California's cap-and-trade program add fees, which were at about 35 cents per gallon by late November, according to SFGate. Rising gasoline demand heading into the holiday season, after Californians have spent nearly two years battling the coronavirus pandemic, has also led to an uptick in demand, which has subsequently contributed to rising prices, AAA Southern California spokesperson Doug Shupe told the Los Angeles Times.\", \"AAA spokesperson Jeffrey Spring also told the Times that heavy rainfall during a storm in October affected production at some oil refineries in California, which he credited with boosting gasoline prices in Northern California and contributing to the average price hikes throughout the state.\"]","href_hash":"756d405a514811ec93db91c1c45dc776"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"756d405a514811ec93db91c1c45dc776"}},
