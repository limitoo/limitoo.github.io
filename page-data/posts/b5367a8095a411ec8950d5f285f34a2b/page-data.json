Why does it seem to be lowering requirements just when the outbreak is growing? And when will it all end? RNZ is here to clear it all up.\", \"Phase three is designed to help the health system handle an Omicron outbreak of several thousand new cases a day.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/284357/eight_col_test.jpg?1641968647\\\" alt=\\\"Covid-19 antigen tests underway with the buffer solution being dripped into the test area of the results strip\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nRapid antigen tests will become a much more prevalent form of testing under phase three. \\nPhoto: 123RF\\n</div>\", \"The shift means a greater focus on individual responsibility, rather than relying on health services to be able to cope and contact trace in the way they had earlier in the pandemic.\", \"\\\"Act as if you might have Covid, and behave accordingly to protect others including using masks and so on,\\\" Dr Bloomfield has advised.\", \"Testing\", \"Case and contact management\", \"Isolation\", \"While Omicron is considered milder than the dangerous Delta variant and is less likely to put people in hospital, some people do still get very sick and it spreads so quickly many more people can be expected to get very ill.\", \"That is, while any one person is less likely to get severe symptoms, many more people overall can be quickly expected to get the virus, so the total number of people who do end up in hospital all at once is likely to be significant.\", \"New Zealand has been recording steadily increasing numbers of daily cases, topping 3000 yesterday and hovering around 5000 today - the trigger for moving to phase three.\", \"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has this week been saying the outbreak is not expected to peak for three to six weeks, and the nature of Omicron means case numbers can be expected to keep doubling every three to five days until we near that peak.\", \"New modelling shows the peak of Covid-19 in the Omicron outbreak in Auckland and Northland alone could reach 4000 daily cases, if transmission is low, or 9000 if it is not.\", \"Even a low-transmission scenario would mean about 400 cases from Auckland and Northland in hospitals at any given time. It would put heavy strain on New Zealand's health system - general wards as well as intensive care - which has suffered decades of underinvestment from successive governments.\", \"Bloomfield noted today that the low-transmission scenario relies on widespread uptake of the booster shot.\", \"The high number of cases from Omicron means the follow-up interviews with cases and high-intensity contact tracing systems will not be able to keep up, so the systems will instead focus on the most high-risk people.\", \"During this time, New Zealand can also be expected to remain in the red traffic light setting. Ardern has suggested these settings, the vaccine passes and mandates are likely to last until the country has progressed well past the peak of cases, so the health system remains operational.\", \"Vaccinations - especially booster doses - are a big help in reducing hospitalisation from Omicron, and New Zealand's high rates will have helped prevent some of the high death rates seen overseas.\", \"Bloomfield also noted studies from the US have shown vaccines - particularly the booster shot - do still help reduce the spread of Omicron.\", \"\\\"One of the studies, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, shows that compared with being unvaccinated the odds of contracting Omicron after receiving three doses dropped by 67 percent - two thirds - and for Delta the risk declined by a stunning 93 percent.\\\"\", \"Masks and other public health measures like frequent, thorough hand-washing also help slow the spread of the virus, so it will be important for people to continue to do this while the virus is spreading.\", \"While the government says it intends for heavy lockdowns to be a thing of the past, the traffic light system does maintain localised lockdowns as an option should things get really out of control.\", \"Meanwhile, the government is also gearing up for more people to start isolating at home when arriving from overseas, beginning from next week with those coming from Australia and expanding to New Zealanders coming from the rest of the world two weeks later.\", \"Hipkins said further advice on whether arrivals will continue to be required to isolate is being sought, considering the virus is circulating widely already.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/262909/eight_col_high_WYNTK-LOGO-BANNER_%281%29.jpg?1620365910\\\" alt=\\\"No metadata\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\"]","href_hash":"b5367a8095a411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b5367a8095a411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
