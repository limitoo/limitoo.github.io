The magazine, which debuted on Sept. 17, is devoted to what Hamilton, the first secretary of the Treasury, fought for: a strong national government that guides and helps the development of a productive, more self-sufficient economy.\", \"I recently interviewed the three founders of National Development to find out where they think the United States is now and where it needs to go next. All three \\u2014 Robert Atkinson, Marshall Auerback and Michael Lind \\u2014 see what they represent as a movement that cuts across party lines. They like a lot of what Donald Trump did on trade, while also liking a lot of the industrial policy in President Biden\\u2019s Build Back Better program.\", \"Those opposed to the \\u201cnational development\\u201d movement argue that it amounts to having the government pick winners and losers. The critics say tariffs and other trade barriers hurt consumers while protecting undeserving but politically well-connected domestic producers. These advocates for free markets and free trade have held sway in U.S. policymaking at least since World War II, but their influence is weakening \\u2014 in part because of the rise of China, which is both an economic and a geopolitical rival.\", \"Here are the first two paragraphs of National Development\\u2019s statement of principles:\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re not beating around the bush,\\u201d Atkinson told me. Atkinson is the founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. He says he wants National Development to become a \\u201cwatering hole\\u201d where people from different political backgrounds can meet to explore common interests. \\u201cFolks in their 30s who are advising a senator or House member and are really into this,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s kind of our core audience. We don\\u2019t need full-page ads in The Times and Washington Post.\\u201d\", \"Auerback, who worked in finance for more than 30 years, says he finds himself agreeing with the trade agenda of Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, \\u201ceven though I think his positions on liberal values are awful.\\u201d As for Trump, Auerback calls him \\u201ckind of a weird bird\\u201d but says he admired Trump\\u2019s insistence on stronger incentives for the use of higher-wage American labor in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement. \\u201cEveryone \\u2018knows\\u2019 free trade is an unalloyed benefit to everyone \\u2014 and it\\u2019s not really,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe benefits are not shared in an equitable way.\\u201d\", \"The National Development founders disagree with the so-called New Brandeisians \\u2014 scholars like Tim Wu and Lina Khan (both of whom are now Biden administration officials) who support vigorous antitrust actions to curb the power of Big Tech and other large companies. The National Development philosophy is that most innovation in the private sector is done by big companies, so breaking them up would set back the United States.\", \"I spoke with Lind, the author of many books on American democratic nationalism, about that. The extra profits that monopolies and oligopolies earn can be recycled into research and development, he said. \\u201cInnovation doesn\\u2019t come from mom-and-pop restaurants competing with each other,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThe Google boys in the garage, yes, but they had a Defense Department grant.\\u201d (Their main grant was from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the National Science Foundation.)\", \"Lind is a professor of practice at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin. He rejects the economic theory that holds that Americans get paid more because they have more skills than Chinese workers. The real reason they get paid more, he says, is that they have better tools to work with, allowing them to produce more per hour of labor. But capitalists can and do change that equation by moving the \\u201ctools\\u201d \\u2014 machinery, software and so forth \\u2014 to countries where labor is cheaper. In some, though not all, sectors the government needs to stop that from happening, he argues: \\u201cAny national government should always put its people\\u2019s interests first.\\u201d\", \"We haven\\u2019t heard the end of this debate.\", \"I recently interviewed Asad Umar, Pakistan\\u2019s federal minister for planning, development, reforms and special initiatives, about Pakistan\\u2019s success in fighting Covid-19. Its reported Covid mortality rate is well below that of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India and Iran. Last year Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary, indirectly complimented Pakistan\\u2019s record while denigrating America\\u2019s Covid-19 response, saying, \\u201cHeck, if we had run it as well as Pakistan ran the response we would have saved in the neighborhood of $10 trillion.\\u201d The World Health Organization and the World Economic Forum have also lauded Pakistan.\", \"Pakistan is far from perfect. There have been only 46.7 vaccination shots per 100 people as of Oct. 31, compared to 131.3 shots per 100 people in the United States. Mask-wearing is spotty. There are too few doctors, partly because many women who go to medical school never practice medicine, instead becoming \\u201cdoctor brides.\\u201d And the rate of infections and deaths might be understated (the government says it\\u2019s not). Still, even a modicum of success is welcome in a nation that still hasn\\u2019t eradicated polio.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve done reasonably well,\\u201d Umar, whose ministry oversees the National Command Operation Center that\\u2019s battling Covid-19, told me. One key to success has been centralized planning and policy formulation, he said. That has included testing, tracking, vaccinations, data collection and \\u201cmicro\\u201d lockdowns that are calibrated to local conditions. \\u201cCountries with centralized, coordinated responses did well\\u201d in fighting Covid-19, Umar said. (Left unsaid: Those without centralized responses \\u2014 such as the United States \\u2014 have stumbled.)\", \"\\u201cRussia\\u2019s and China\\u2019s positions in the world economy have been reversed since they implemented different modes of marketization. Russia\\u2019s share of world G.D.P. almost halved, from 3.7 percent in 1990 to about 2 percent in 2017, while China\\u2019s share increased close to sixfold, from a mere 2.2 percent to about one-eighth of global output. Russia underwent dramatic deindustrialization, while China became the proverbial workshop of world capitalism.\\u201d\", \"\\u2014 Isabella M.
