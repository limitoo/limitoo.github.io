rain\\u00a0is the result\\u00a0of an atmospheric river but it's not the only one to have hit the country this year.\", \"There was also an atmospheric river during the devastating\\u00a0flooding in

often by the end of the century, under both emissions scenarios.\\\"\", \"The moderate emissions scenario (SSP245 for any climate buffs out\\u00a0there) is projected\\u00a0to result in 2.5 to 3
