We've spoken to the experts to find out.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/20204fcf41a73ffdc74acc9d4c5c0811\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Social media posts often claim the constitution prohibits state governments making laws regarding telecommunications. But that's not the case.</div>\", \"Online,\\u00a0Section 94H(1) of the Commonwealth Privacy Act\\u00a0is being used as a common defence for not having to display a QR code for check-in purposes.\", \"Under the provision, which was added to the act last year, employers must not dismiss employees if they refuse to download the COVIDSafe app \\u2014 the federal government's widely criticised contact tracing tool that has all but been\\u00a0abandoned.\", \"The section does not make it illegal to require businesses to display a QR code under public health orders, nor does it relate to check-in apps introduced by state governments (such as the Service NSW and Service Victoria apps).\", \"Another law regularly referenced by those arguing against QR check-ins is Section 51.5 of the Australian Constitution which confers on the federal government the power to make laws in regards to telecommunications.\", \"This is often incorrectly interpreted to mean that only the federal government can make laws about mobile phones, and the states cannot.\", \"However, Joellen Riley Munton, former dean of the University of Sydney Law School, told Fact Check this view reflected \\\"a weak understanding of Australian constitutional law\\\".\", \"\\\"Section 51 of the constitution confers a power on the Commonwealth to make laws with respect to telecommunications, but it does not rob states of their plenary powers to make all manner of laws,\\\" Dr Riley Munton said in an email.\", \"\\\"It is just that a state law that is inconsistent with a validly made federal law will be ineffective.\", \"\\\"In any event, the QR code requirements can easily be characterised as laws related to public health, since it is a tool to assist with contact tracing.

class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Requiring proof of vaccination does not breach discrimination or biosecurity laws.(Supplied: Victor Dominello on LinkedIn)</div>\", \"Arguments around the legality of proof-of-vaccination requirements have been similarly debunked.\", \"The\\u00a0Nuremberg Code, drafted in 1947 in response to deadly medical experiments carried out by the Nazis during World War II, is commonly referenced as grounds for sidestepping vaccination requirements.\", \"But the code applies to medical experiments, not COVID-19 vaccinations, with\\u00a0many fact checkers having addressed\\u00a0claims that it renders numerous pandemic public health orders illegal.\", \"Other social media users have listed sections 4 and 6 of the\\u00a0Disability Discrimination Act\\u00a0to argue against the requirement to disclose vaccination status, either to keep a job or enter premises.\", \"However, according to\\u00a0Tasmania's former anti-discrimination commissioner Robin Banks, a \\\"very important point\\\" about the act is that it only provides protection to people with a disability.\", \"\\\"[It] doesn't provide protection if\\u2026 you don't have a disability,\\\" Ms Banks told Fact Check.\", \"Section 4 of the act merely sets out the definitions used in the act \\u2014 it provides no legal argument for why an individual should not disclose vaccination status.\", \"Section 6, meanwhile, makes it unlawful to engage in indirect disability discrimination; for example, a person with a disability being required to do something with which they cannot comply.\", \"But for discrimination to have occurred, Ms Banks explained, a person must be able to prove they are less able to comply with the requirement because of their disability, and the requirement must be \\\"unreasonable\\\" in the circumstances.\", \"Ms Banks said this was the point at which arguments against proof-of-vaccination requirements fell flat.\", \"\\\"Vaccination status does not readily fall within the definition of disability, nor does being unvaccinated,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"There is no basis that I can see that it could be argued that being unvaccinated is a disability for the purposes of the protections under disability discrimination laws.\\\"\", \"She added that \\\"requiring a person to disclose their vaccination status may be reasonable in many circumstances as it may be a necessary part of measures needed to reduce community transmission of a deadly and highly infectious, airborne virus\\\".\", \"Finally,\\u00a0Section 95 of the Biosecurity Act, which states that \\\"force must not be used against an individual to require the individual to comply with a biosecurity measure\\\", also had \\\"no role to play in relation to people who refuse to disclose their vaccination status\\\", according to Ms Banks.\", \"\\\"It protects against use of force in respect of such failures except in specific circumstances; for example, requiring [people] to be tested for the presence of a particular human disease, to provide particular body samples, to require them to stay in a particular place, or not visit a particular place or places.\", \"\\\"Section 95 \\u2026 does not appear to be directly relevant to the question of whether or not a person's vaccination status can be sought.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">In other news</div>\", \"<img

in the wake of the Glasgow climate change summit.(AP:\\u00a0Steve Reigate/Pool Photo)</div>\", \"With the UN Climate Change Conference, or COP26, getting under way in Glasgow this week, fact checkers around the world were busy debunking climate misinformation.Those at Reuters, for instance,\\u00a0found\\u00a0that statements made by climate sceptic Maurice Newman in an opinion piece published in The Australian six years ago had been taken out of context online to create the impression that an Australian politician had labelled climate change a \\\"UN hoax\\\" designed to create a \\\"New World Order\\\".\", \"The online posts originated in Russian state media coverage of the op-ed from 2015, according to Reuters, which also noted that while Mr Newman was the chairman of the business advisory council to prime minister Tony Abbott, he was not a politician.\", \"Moreover, the views expressed by Mr Newman were personal opinions and were \\\"at odds with the scientific consensus on climate change\\\".\", \"Reuters also\\u00a0took aim\\u00a0at claims that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had used the Glasgow Summit to pledge to eliminate cash in an effort to curb emissions.\", \"But as the fact checkers found, those claims were based on a misunderstanding of Mr Johnson's slogan of \\\"coal, cars, cash and trees\\\", with the cash component referring to funding for initiatives to combat climate change and not to a plan to eradicate cash payments from society.\", \"Fact Check has\\u00a0previously debunked similar claims\\u00a0suggesting the NSW government planned to force residents to transfer their money to a \\\"virtual wallet\\\" by mid-2022, which would then be used in lieu of cash for purchasing goods and services.\", \"BBC Reality Check, meanwhile, this week\\u00a0weighed up\\u00a0comments by climate activist Greta Thunberg, who disputed claims that the UK had reduced emissions by 44 per cent since 1990.\", \"According to the BBC, the 44 per cent reduction referred to \\\"territorial emissions\\\" \\u2014 emissions that occur within a country's borders, including exports but excluding emissions from international aviation, shipping and imports.\", \"Territorial emissions figures are commonly used by governments when reporting their emissions, including in submissions made under the Kyoto protocol.\", \"However, data relating to \\\"consumption emissions\\\", a measure which includes goods produced overseas and imported by the UK, shows the country's carbon footprint was estimated to have contracted by 26 per cent between 1997 and 2018.\", \"A\\u00a0new report\\u00a0from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) \\u2014 an international organisation that tracks online hate and misinformation \\u2014 has found that 10 online \\\"fringe publishers\\\" are responsible for 69 per cent of digital climate change denial.\", \"The American far-right news site Breitbart topped the list of \\\"superpolluters\\\", which also included Newsmax, The Washington Times and Russian state media sites such as RT.com and Sputnik News.\", \"According to the report, engagement with posts on Facebook that linked to content from the 10 identified sites accounted for more than two-thirds of all Facebook interactions with climate denial content.\", \"By producing content on social media platforms to sow climate change scepticism, the \\\"Toxic Ten\\\" websites created a sense \\\"that there is a more extensive debate than there really is\\\", the CCDH noted.\", \"\\\"They spread baseless, unscientific climate denial on their own websites but the real objective is to harness the power of social media platforms to spread this skepticism to the public and prevent consensus on facts and solutions \\u2014 even though our lives depend on both,\\\" the report found.\", \"And while Facebook had promised in March 2021 to begin adding links to correct information on such posts, just 8 per cent of the most popular posts containing climate misinformation from the Toxic Ten carried those labels.\", \"The report also noted that the Toxic Ten, which reached 186 million followers on social media platforms, were in part funded by Google Ad revenue, jointly generating up to $5.3 million over six months.\", \"The CCDH previously published\\u00a0a report\\u00a0on the \\\"Disinformation Dozen\\\", a group of social media influencers responsible for around two-thirds of anti-vaccine content online.\", \"Edited by Ellen McCutchan\\u00a0with thanks to Fae O'Toole and Matt Harvey\", \"Got a fact that needs
