Treasury Chief Rishi Sunak will also be fined. \", \"The news came after London's Metropolitan Police force said earlier Tuesday that it was issuing 30 more fixed penalty notices in relation to the \\\"partygate\\\" scandal, which has angered many in Britain and seen dozens of politicians and officials investigated over allegations that the government flouted its own pandemic restrictions. \\u00a0 \\\"The Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer have today received notification that the Metropolitan police intend to issue them with fixed penalty notices,\\\" a spokesperson for Johnson's office said. \\\"We have no further details, but we will update you again when we do.\\\" \\u00a0 It was not clear how much Johnson and Sunak were fined.\", \"Johnson has denied any wrongdoing, but he is alleged to have been at several of the dozen events in his 10 Downing Street office and other government buildings that are being investigated by the police. \\u00a0 Johnson's government has been shaken by public anger over revelations that his staff held \\\"bring your own booze\\\" office parties, birthday celebrations and \\\"wine time Fridays\\\" in 2020 and 2021 while millions in Britain were barred from meeting with friends and family because of his government's COVID-19 restrictions. Thousands of people were fined between 60 pounds ($79) and 10,000 pounds ($13,200) by police for rule-breaking social gatherings. \\u00a0 Opponents, and some members of the governing Conservative Party, have said that Johnson should resign if he is issued a fine for breaking rules he imposed on the rest of the country during the pandemic.\", \"In total, police said they were issuing at least 50 fines for the breaches, but did not identify who the recipients were. Police said they had sent questionnaires to more than 100 people, including the prime minister, and interviewed witnesses as part of the investigation.\\u00a0\", \"In January, civil servant Sue Gray published a report into some of the gatherings, the ones not under criminal investigation. She said \\\"failures of leadership and judgment\\\" in Johnson's government allowed events to occur that should not have happened.\"]","href_hash":"a79eb624ba6811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a79eb624ba6811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
