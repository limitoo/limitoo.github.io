Her usual meal was an off-menu request: a turkey sandwich on medianoche bread, with cream cheese and strawberry preserves.\", \"She had to explain the sandwich so many times that she asked the restaurant\\u2019s manager to put it on the menu to make it easier to order. At some point in the late 1920s or the early \\u201930s (nobody remembers when), she returned to find her name in neon lights, with the sandwich on the menu for 25 cents.\", \"\\u201cIt was quite a surprise for her,\\u201d Margarita Ulacia, 82, of San Jos\\u00e9, Costa Rica, said about her mother\\u2019s reaction to the sign. \\u201cBut she was delighted, and my grandmother was horrified.\\u201d\", \"A friend of Ms. Vald\\u00e9s-Fauli\\u2019s even had a dream that the sandwich would become famous. And it did. When Cubans left the island after the Cuban revolution, the sandwich followed.\", \"Nearly a century after the sandwich was invented, classic Cuban establishments like Versailles, La Carreta or Pinecrest Bakery still have a place for the Elena Ruz on their menus.\", \"\\u201cIt became an icon of Cuba,\\u201d said Antonio \\u201cBobo\\u201d Llizo, the second-generation owner of Los Bobos Cafeteria in Doral, Fla. \\u201cIt\\u2019s one of the sandwiches that my dad had to recreate and place on the menu.\\u201d\", \"At Mr. Llizo\\u2019s restaurant, chefs butter the medianoche bread \\u2014 a sweeter, softer sibling of Cuban bread, similar to brioche \\u2014 stuff the sandwich with thinly sliced turkey breast, Philadelphia cream cheese and Smucker\\u2019s strawberry preserves, and then heat it.\", \"Ms. Ulacia said that her mother, who died in 2011, probably didn\\u2019t request butter on her sandwich. But chefs have found it helps brown the toasted Elena Ruz.\", \"Despite its long-held fame, the sandwich is barely ordered anymore, Mr. Llizo said. Young Cubans are forgetting about the sandwich and its history. When his daughter brought little Elena Ruz sandwiches to her elementary school for a presentation on Ms. Vald\\u00e9s-Fauli, most of the Cuban parents had never heard of it.\", \"But Mr. Llizo and other restaurateurs wouldn\\u2019t dare take it off the menu.\", \"\\u201cNot having it would kind of remove your Cuban card,\\u201d said Daniel Figueredo, who serves a version of the sandwich at his restaurant Sanguich de Miami on Calle Ocho.\", \"His Elena Ruthless is an adaptation of the original Elena Ruz, substituting homemade guava marmalade for the strawberry preserves and adding bacon to mix. It\\u2019s on his secret menu because it\\u2019s a sloppy sandwich to prepare.\", \"\\u201cI believe traditions should be protected,\\u201d Mr. Figueredo said. \\u201cBut I do believe that you have some parameters you can develop and have fun.\\u201d\", \"Michael Beltran, who was raised in a Cuban household and runs Ariete, Nav\\u00e9 and Chug\\u2019s Diner, agrees.\", \"\\u201cPeople need to stop getting into, \\u2018Well that\\u2019s how it\\u2019s supposed to be,\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cCuban food is up in the air for interpretation. Interpret it all the ways.\\u201d\", \"In fact, there have been many interpretations of the Elena Ruz, something that her daughter takes issue with, at least when it comes to the origin of the dish.\", \"\\u201cRespect the form in which the sandwich was created, and if you do a variation,\\u201d Ms. Ulacia said in Spanish, \\u201cdon\\u2019t play with the name.\\u201d\", \"Recipe: Elena Ruz Sandwich\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
