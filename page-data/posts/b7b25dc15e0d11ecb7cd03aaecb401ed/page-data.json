Grocery store chain Kroger announced a $50 surcharge for salaried, non-union employees starting in January. In addition, Kroger said it is changing its policy of two weeks paid sick leave for those employees who contract COVID, removing unvaccinated employees from eligibility for the leave, according to The Associated Press.\", \"The AP also reported that Kroger was offering its employees $100 bonuses for getting vaccinated.\", \"Delta Air Lines also implemented a $200 per month insurance surcharge for their unvaccinated employees Nov. 1, which they announced in August and said at the time they had a 75 percent vaccination rate among employees, according to USA Today.\", \"The airline also began administering weekly COVID tests among its unvaccinated employees in September.\", \"In Arizona, state health officials reported over 3,000 COVID cases and an additional 81 deaths caused by the virus, with a slight dip in hospitalizations to 2,723 as of Tuesday.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952781/arizona-covid-vaccine-requirement-health-insurance.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A nurse shows off a vial of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine outside of the Chatham County Health Department on Dec. 15, 2020 in Savannah, Georgia.
