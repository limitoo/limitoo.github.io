The filmmakers, Peter Middleton and James Spinney, mostly run through the well-trodden timeline of Charlie Chaplin\\u2019s life and fame \\u2014 from poverty to ubiquity to exile in Switzerland \\u2014 but they keep up a wondering, questing approach.\", \"Narrated by the actress Pearl Mackie (\\u201cDoctor Who\\u201d), the film maintains a sprightly tempo, trying out angles on Chaplin: his technique of working out comedy bits and scenes on camera; the story of an impersonator named Charlie Aplin; his satire of Adolf Hitler in \\u201cThe Great Dictator\\u201d; and his virtuosic creation, the Little Tramp, which is linked to the star\\u2019s impoverished upbringing in South London. There is also commentary by the actor and director Mack Sennett, the actress Virginia Cherrill (star of \\u201cCity Lights\\u201d), and Lita Grey Chaplin, who worked for Chaplin at 12 years old and married him at 16.\", \"The film features two dramatizations of audio interviews by lip-syncing actors (a method the directors also used in \\u201cNotes on Blindness\\u201d). In one chat, Chaplin imparts behind-the-scenes tidbits to Life magazine at his Swiss mansion; in the other, an older neighbor in South London reminisces about Charlie to Kevin Brownlow (who himself co-directed the important three-part 1983 series \\u201cUnknown Chaplin\\u201d). There\\u2019s also a recreation of a contentious press conference from 1947.\", \"Middleton and Spinney address Chaplin\\u2019s romantic scandals but sympathetically dwell on his persecution by anti-Communists in the United States. The tell-all promise of the film\\u2019s title dwindles away into predictable perspectives from members of his family. But this introduction to Chaplin shines whenever he performs, displaying his comic genius for doing everything wrong to absolute perfection.\"]","href_hash":"e0c3187358e911ec860041a44871c280"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e0c3187358e911ec860041a44871c280"}},
