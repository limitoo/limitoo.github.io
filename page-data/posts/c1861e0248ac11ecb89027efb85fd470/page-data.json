He was 88.\", \"His death was announced on his website. No cause was specified.\", \"Over more than five decades, Mr. Smith\\u2019s historical thrillers and adventure novels, which often spanned several generations and several continents, became a popular franchise of series and sequels.\", \"Reviewing his book \\u201cThe Diamond Hunters\\u201d in The New York Times Book Review in 1972, Martin Levin wrote that \\u201cthe potpourri Wilbur Smith has assembled is rife with lifelong misunderstandings, undying hates, unbelievably nefarious schemes and nick\\u2010of\\u2010time rescues \\u2014 delivered with the deadpan sincerity of the pulp greats.\\u201d\", \"Raised on a 30,000-acre cattle ranch in what was then the British protectorate of Rhodesia (and is now Zambia), Mr. Smith was a bookish boy whose strict father discouraged reading (\\u201cI don\\u2019t think he ever read a book in his life, including mine,\\u201d he told The Daily Telegraph in 2007) but went on to draft plots on official paper he lifted from his work at the government\\u2019s Inland Revenue Service.\", \"He completed his first manuscript in 1962. Twenty publishers sent telegrams rejecting it. He revised and reduced it, embracing the advice of Charles Pick, the deputy managing director of the publishing house Heinemann, to tell a story that drew more fully on his own experience. \\u201cWrite only about those things you know well,\\u201d Mr. Smith said Mr. Pick advised.\", \"Inspired by the life of his grandfather, who was lured by the Witwatersrand gold rush of the 1880s and fought in the Zulu wars, and by his own upbringing on his father\\u2019s ranch, Mr. Smith wrote \\u201cWhen the Lion Feeds,\\u201d which was published in 1964.\", \"It became the first in a successful series of what Stephen King in 2006 praised as \\u201cswashbuckling novels of Africa\\u201d in which \\u201cthe bodices rip and the blood flows.\\u201d Subsequent decades would bring other series, based in Southern Africa and ancient Egypt.\", \"\\u201cI wrote about hunting and gold mining and carousing and women,\\u201d Mr. Smith said.\", \"He set other books in locales ranging from Antarctica to the Indian Ocean. \\u201cWild Justice\\u201d (1979), one of the first of his books to become a best seller in the United States (where it was published as \\u201cThe Delta Decision\\u201d), was the story of the hijacking of a plane off the Seychelles \\u2014 one of many places Mr. Smith called home. (He also had homes in London, Cape Town, Switzerland and Malta.)\", \"Wilbur Addison Smith was born on Jan. 9, 1933, in Broken Hill, Northern Rhodesia (now Kabwe, Zambia). He was named for Wilbur Wright, the aviation pioneer. His father, Herbert, was a rancher who became a sheet metal worker. His mother, Elfreda, was a painter who encouraged his reading.\", \"He contracted cerebral malaria when he was 18 months old. \\u201cIt probably helped me,\\u201d he said later, \\u201cbecause I think you have to be slightly crazy to try to earn a living from writing.\\u201d He caught polio when he was a teenager, which resulted in a weakened right leg.\", \"When he was 8, his father gave him a .22-caliber Remington rifle. \\u201cI shot my first animal shortly afterward and my father ritually smeared the animal\\u2019s blood on my face,\\u201d he wrote in his memoir, \\u201cOn Leopard Rock: A Life of Adventures\\u201d (2018). \\u201cThe blood was the mark of emerging manhood. I refused to bathe for days afterward.\\u201d\", \"He attended Michaelhouse, a private boys\\u2019 school in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands of South Africa. He started a student newspaper there, but he hated school.\", \"\\u201cMichaelhouse was a debilitating experience,\\u201d he later recalled. \\u201cThere was no respect for the pupils. The teachers were brutal, the prefects beat us, and the senior boys bullied us. It was a cycle of violence that kept perpetuating itself.\\u201d Reading and writing, he said, became his refuge.\", \"\\u201cI couldn\\u2019t sing nor dance nor wield a paintbrush worth a damn,\\u201d he told the Australian website Booktopia in 2012, \\u201cbut I could weave a pretty tale.\\u201d\", \"He said that he had originally wanted to write about social conditions in South Africa as a journalist, but that his father nudged him toward what he thought was a more stable profession. After graduating from Rhodes University in Grahamstown (now Makhanda), South Africa, with a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1954, he worked for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company for four years, then joined his father\\u2019s sheet metal manufacturing business. When that company faltered, he became a government tax assessor.\", \"He married Anne Rennie in 1957. They divorced in 1962 after having two children: a son, Shaun, and a daughter, Christian. He married Jewell Slabbart in 1964; they had a son, Lawrence, before that marriage also ended in divorce. In 1971, he married Danielle Thomas; she died in 1999. The next year he married Mokhiniso Rakhimova, who was 39 years his junior and whom he met in a London bookstore. He adopted her son, Dieter Schmidt, from a previous marriage. Complete information about survivors was not immediately available.\", \"A few of Mr. Smith\\u2019s books have been adapted into films, including \\u201cShout at the Devil\\u201d (1976), which starred Lee Marvin and Roger Moore.\", \"Mr. Smith had his detractors, who saw some of his writing as glorifying colonialism and furthering racial and gender stereotypes. And he was not always a favorite of critics.\", \"He maintained, as he told the Australian publication The Age, that he paid little attention. \\u201cThe snootiness of critics is so silly,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re judging Great Danes against Pekingese. I\\u2019m not writing that literature \\u2014 I\\u2019ve never set out to write it. I\\u2019m writing stories.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cNow, when I sit down to write the first page of a novel, I never give a thought to who will eventually read it,\\u201d he is quoted on his website, recalling the advice of his first publisher, Mr. Pick: \\u201cHe said, \\u2018Don\\u2019t talk about your books with anybody, even me, until they are written.\\u2019 Until it is written, a book is merely smoke on the wind.\\u201d\", \"Later in his career, Mr. Smith was churning out two books annually, with the help of a stable of co-authors.\", \"\\u201cFor the past few years,\\u201d he said when he announced the collaboration, \\u201cmy fans have made it very clear that they would like to read my novels and revisit my family of characters faster than I can write them.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c1861e0248ac11ecb89027efb85fd470"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c1861e0248ac11ecb89027efb85fd470"}},
