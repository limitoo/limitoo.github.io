Obrador follows with an approval rating of 66 percent, followed by Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi with 58 percent, Merkel with a 54 percent approval rating, and Australia's Scott Morrison with 47 percent.\", \"Among those who ranked last are Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\\u00e1nchez with an approval rating of 37 percent, and France's Emmanuel Macron and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who received approval ratings of 36 percent and 35 percent respectively.\", \"The survey by Morning Consult Political Intelligence also shows that since Biden took office in January, his approval rating has dipped a total of 6 percent, from 50 percent on January 21, 2021, to the president's current 44 percent approval rating.\", \"In contrast, individuals who disapprove of Biden as leader has jumped from 28 percent, to 48 percent in the same time frame.\", \"Meanwhile, nationwide, Biden continues to suffer poor ratings, with a recent USA Today-Suffolk University poll showing that the president's approval rating currently stands at 38 percent. That survey was conducted in the days that followed the elections that took place across the United States on November 2.\", \"David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, told USA Today that the results indicated a \\\"historic low point\\\" for the Biden administration.\", \"\\\"This poll also shows that the generic congressional ballot test of voters has flipped to Republicans, which is unusual because this indicator often gives Democrats the edge,\\\" Paleologos told the news outlet of the poll results.\", \"\\\"The generic congressional ballot test is an important barometer of voting behavior because it removes individual dynamics of each race and focuses on how voters are leaning between the two parties. In the Suffolk/USA TODAY poll, this indicator not only tilted to Republicans, but it also completely flipped the other way.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928057/biden-delivers-remarks-infrastructure-bill-passage.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during a press conference in the State Dining Room at the White House on November 6, 2021 in Washington, DC.
