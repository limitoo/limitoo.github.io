The vaccine requirement will cover 84 million private sector workers.\", \"The plan requires all businesses with 100 or more employees to mandate vaccination. Workers who refuse must undergo weekly testing and wear masks.\", \"U.S. officials also unveiled new emergency rules for health care workers, requiring 17 million of them who received Medicare or Medicaid funding to get vaccinated by the same date.\", \"Some major companies including Tyson Foods \\u2014 which now has a 96 percent vaccination rate \\u2014 and United Airlines were quick to embrace the mandates, but others have held off.\", \"Biden has imposed vaccine requirements on federal workers, but the new rule covering employees of all large private businesses is a more dramatic use of his executive power.\", \"The numbers: Seventy percent of adults in the U.S. are now fully vaccinated. Some experts have estimated that 90 percent or more of the total population \\u2014 adults and children \\u2014 would need to be fully vaccinated for the U.S. to reach herd immunity.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"The major deal announced at the climate summit in Glasgow on Thursday included 23 countries that are promising to stop building and issuing permits for new coal plants for the first time.\", \"But the U.S., China, India and Australia \\u2014 all major coal producers or consumers \\u2014 were not part of the pact. Observers in Glasgow said they were disappointed in the absence of the U.S. from the sweeping pledge to phase out the use of coal. The decision appeared to be driven by U.S. domestic politics.\", \"Among those countries that did sign on, however, are five of the world\\u2019s top 20 power-generating countries: Poland, Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam and Ukraine.\", \"The Biden administration did join a pledge to end financing for unabated oil and gas, as well as coal, in other countries by the end of next year. That move will steer public financing away from fossil fuels.\", \"Quotable: Alok Sharma, the British politician who heads the COP26 conference, declared that \\u201cthe end of coal is in sight.\\u201d\", \"Few details: The promise to phase out coal, which is the single biggest source of planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions worldwide, was short on specifics and offered leeway in phaseout dates. Future presidents could also reverse the progress.\", \"Authorities in Addis Ababa accelerated their crackdown against ethnic Tigrayans, who are accused of sympathizing with the rebels pressing toward the city.\", \"The U.S. diplomat Jeffrey Feltman landed in the capital for talks with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed with the backing of regional African leaders, who are alarmed about a possible all-out collapse in Ethiopia.\", \"Door-to-door searches and arrests targeted Tigrayans, who are from the same ethnic group as the fighters who have battled Ethiopian government forces the past year, raising concerns of bursts of ethnic violence.\", \"The fighting seemed to be spreading. A Tigray People\\u2019s Liberation Front leader said the group\\u2019s fighters had reached a town about 120 miles northeast of Addis Ababa, where they were locked in battle with Ethiopian forces.\", \"The government teeters: Abiy, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, now finds his very future as leader in doubt.

Two weeks later, the city is a Covid hot spot, with an outbreak among mostly unvaccinated people that is threatening to burden intensive care units. The region\\u2019s president, Massimiliano Fedriga, said, \\u201cIt is the moment to say with clarity: Enough idiocy.\\u201d\", \"This movie season, black-and-white films are everywhere. Kyle Buchanan spoke with the cinematographers behind three major monochromatic features to examine the trend.\", \"A new spin on Shakespeare, \\u201cThe Tragedy of Macbeth,\\u201d is not only leached of color, but also shot in a claustrophobic aspect ratio rarely used since the 1950s. \\u201cIt\\u2019s meant to bring theatricality, and to lose temporality,\\u201d the cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel said.\", \"The technique can also have a narrative purpose, as it does in \\u201cPassing,\\u201d which follows two light-skinned Black women, one of whom has been passing for white. In a scene where the friends are reunited, the movie\\u2019s cinematographer, Eduard Grau, flooded the shots with light. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t want to clearly show to the audience at first whether our characters were white or Black or mixed-race,\\u201d Grau said. \", \"One of the strengths of black-and-white \\u201cis not to tell you how a person or place looks, but how they feel,\\u201d said Haris Zambarloukos, the cinematographer for \\u201cBelfast,\\u201d a film about a boy in Northern Ireland during the 1960s. \\u201cIt has a transcendental quality to be of the past and the present.
