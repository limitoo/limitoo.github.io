In 2015 New Zealand won the youth title again.\", \"Globally 3x3 is now more competitive - and professional - than it once was but Basketball New Zealand's head of high performance Leonard King still believes New Zealand will win a senior three-a-side medal before they do in the five-a-side competition.\", \"\\\"3x3 allows in my mind New Zealand an even footprint to compete,\\\" King says.\", \"\\\"In the five-a-side we've got a good six or seven players that are really world class but once you get past the sixth and the seventh player there is a bit of a drop off, in 3x3 you've got four world class players there is no drop off in talent so I definitely could see us medalling at an Olympics.\\\"\", \"Despite 3x3 reaching new heights King still needs to twist a few arms to get players to commit to a format which pays players differently and offers different ways to represent their country.\", \"\\\"You're going against years and years of tradition of the five-a-side which is all anyone ever knew, the pathway for five-a-side and how to earn a living is entrenched ... trying to educate the athletes as well as our coaches on 3x3 hasn't been easy but the great thing is that've had a lot of success so that success draws players to it.\\\"\", \"After briefly stepping off the international circuit, New Zealand has a busy upcoming few months on the 3x3 global stage.\", \"New Zealand withdrew from qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics as Covid-19 hit Basketball New Zealand's finances.\", \"Kings says the decision not to push for a place in Tokyo \\\"had a huge impact\\\" on the 3x3 national programme.\", \"\\\"These guys had been working a large part of the last 10 years of their life to get to the Olympic Games, so making a decision like that was not an easy decision and not something that we've been proud of but it was the best thing that we could do for basketball in New Zealand given the situation of Covid.\\\"\", \"The fallout, King says, effected the domestic 3x3 programme as well as robbing four players of meaningful international experience.\", \"After missing out on the opportunity to take part in the sport's Olympic debut, New Zealand did qualify for the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham - again the first time 3x3 will be at the Games.\", \"But before Birmingham comes Belgium. With a detour to Singapore in between.\", \"New Zealand has qualified men's and women's teams for the seventh edition of the senior 3x3 World Cup in June in Antwerp.\", \"It is the fifth time the men's team will compete at the world cup and the third time for the women.\", \"Both teams were undefeated at the Asian Qualifier in Qatar in March.\", \"King says the New Zealand sides sent to the qualifiers were developing, younger teams - but they showed their worth.\", \"\\\"We're always looking to build depth and create a bigger pool of players to chose from so we intentionally wanted to make sure we offered an opportunity for some of our rising players.\\\"\", \"The men won the qualifying final over Iran thanks to the 2015 3x3 U18 World Cup MVP, Tai Wynyard, who scored the game-winner.\", \"Another 2015 world champion, Nikau McCullough, led all scorers in the men's category at the qualifiers with 37 points.

So much so that she wants to be seen as a go-to player for 3x3 and says she is prepared to move away from the five-a-side game.\", \"\\\"It's pretty much go all out for 10 minutes in comparison to a 40 minute game...I enjoy it a bit better, less thinking and just go for it.\\\"\", \"A firefighter in her day job, Fotu is thankful for shift work and special leave to play for New Zealand so that she can pursue a career as well as her sporting dreams.\", \"\\\"There is a lot of opportunity there for 3x3, especially for the women's game. Who we meet for qualifiers is a bit different to who we meet five-on-five. We go against some pretty tough teams for five-on-five, but three-on-three I feel like is anyone's game it doesn't matter how much money a country has or how good they are in the past.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"eced7ccbb26011ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eced7ccbb26011ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
