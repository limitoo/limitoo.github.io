Those sailing from Turkey are generally taken to Calabria or Puglia in the \\\"heel\\\" of the Italian mainland.\", \"The charity Resqship tweeted Sunday that after it alerted authorities about an overcrowded wooden boat with 100 migrants south of Lampedusa, the Italian coast vessel evacuated them to safety.\", \"In Roccella Jonica, Red Cross volunteers early Sunday handed the migrants plastic clogs, blankets, food and protective face masks as part of COVID-19 precautions.
