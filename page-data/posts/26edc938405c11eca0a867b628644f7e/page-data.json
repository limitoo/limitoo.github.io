Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, Nov. 8-14. Details and times are subject to change.\", \"INDEPENDENT LENS: FERGUSON RISES (2021) 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). This documentary about the aftermath of the killing of Michael Brown Jr., who was shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, is built around interviews with Brown\\u2019s father, Michael Brown Sr. It looks at how the movement that grew in response to Brown\\u2019s killing helped pushed forward conversations about policing around the country, and at the elder Brown\\u2019s activism in the years since. The documentary, directed by Mobolaji Olambiwonnu, won an audience award at this year\\u2019s Tribeca Film Festival.\", \"DEAR RIDER (2021) 9 p.m. on HBO. The life and legacy of the snowboarding entrepreneur Jake Burton Carpenter is the subject of this new documentary. Carpenter, who died in 2019, helped popularize and legitimize snowboarding as a sport through his company, Burton Snowboards, which he started in the late 1970s. The documentary looks at that work and at the later years of Carpenter\\u2019s life, which were interrupted by health issues including testicular cancer and a rare nerve disease that temporarily paralyzed him \\u2014 but didn\\u2019t take his lust for life. \\u201cLife is not about having a pulse,\\u201d Carpenter said in a 2015 interview with The New York Times. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about having friends and experiences and living.\\u201d\", \"ATTICA (2021) 7:25 p.m. on Showtime. The filmmaker Stanley Nelson revisits the 1971 prison uprising at Attica Correctional Facility, near Buffalo, N.Y., in this documentary, which debuted last week. Taking advantage of five decades\\u2019 worth of hindsight, Nelson speaks to people who took part in or were affected by the events firsthand, including reporters, formerly incarcerated people and family members of law enforcement. The revolt, which lasted several days and ended in a brutal retaking of the prison by authorities, was driven by demands for better living conditions \\u2014 demands that Nelson emphasizes as he explores the event and its violent conclusion. \\u201cIt\\u2019s law and order carried to its extreme, and I think it\\u2019s the start of a whole different turn in American history,\\u201d Nelson said in a recent interview with The Times. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t see the film without thinking about where we are today.\\u201d\", \"THE 55TH ANNUAL CMA AWARDS 8 p.m. on ABC. The singer-songwriter Luke Bryan will host this year\\u2019s edition of the Country Music Association Awards from Nashville. The nominees for the entertainer of the year award, perhaps the biggest of the night, are Eric Church, Luke Combs, Miranda Lambert, Chris Stapleton and Carrie Underwood. All five are scheduled to perform or present during the ceremony. Other performers on the bill include Jennifer Hudson, Keith Urban, Zac Brown Band and Brothers Osborne.\", \"PATHS OF GLORY (1957) 6:15 p.m. on TCM. Typical war movies find drama in deadly missions taken on by extraordinary soldiers. Stanley Kubrick\\u2019s \\u201cPaths of Glory\\u201d finds drama in what a group of soldiers can\\u2019t \\u2014 or won\\u2019t \\u2014 do. Kirk Douglas stars as a French army colonel in World War I whose men are sent on an impossible mission. When the mission doesn\\u2019t pan out, he\\u2019s forced to defend his soldiers against accusations of cowardice from military leadership. The result is a film that \\u201chas the impact of hard reality, mainly because its frank avowal of agonizing, uncompensated injustice is pursued to the bitter, tragic end,\\u201d Bosley Crowther wrote in his review for The New York Times in 1957. \\u201cKubrick\\u2019s sullen camera,\\u201d Crowther added, \\u201cbores directly into the minds of scheming men and into the hearts of patient, frightened soldiers who have to accept orders to die.\\u201d\", \"KEVIN GARNETT: ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE 8 p.m. on Showtime. The subtitle of this sports documentary is a reference to words yelled by its subject, the basketball star Kevin Garnett, in an on-court interview in 2008 as confetti rained down. It was a moment of triumph: The Boston Celtics had just won a championship game against the Los Angeles Lakers. (One might worry, rewatching the moment, that he\\u2019s going to swallow some of that confetti.) The documentary looks at how Garnett got to that moment, and where he\\u2019s gone since, through interviews with basketball figures including Paul Pierce, Doc Rivers and Allen Iverson, and through reams of archival footage.\", \"CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (2005) 5:30 p.m. on TNT. Timoth\\u00e9e Chalamet devotees ate up pictures of him dressed as a young Willy Wonka last month. The images came from the set of \\u201cWonka,\\u201d an upcoming prequel movie that promises to give Roald Dahl\\u2019s weird chocolatier a back story. It won\\u2019t be the first film to try that: This 2005 take on \\u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\u201d which was directed by the filmic confectioner Tim Burton and starred Johnny Depp, gave its Wonka a back story through flashbacks to a childhood spent under the thumb of a mean, sugar-averse dentist father (Christopher Lee). In his review for The Times, A.O. Scott called Burton\\u2019s adaptation \\u201cwondrous and flawed.\\u201d While the film\\u2019s attempt to give Wonka an illuminating past flounders, Scott wrote, the movie \\u201csucceeds in doing what far too few films aimed primarily at children even know how to attempt anymore, which is to feed \\u2014 even to glut \\u2014 the youthful appetite for aesthetic surprise.\\u201d\", \"MAYOR OF KINGSTOWN 9 p.m. on Paramount Network. Jeremy Renner, Dianne Wiest and Kyle Chandler star in this new thriller series from the filmmaker Taylor Sheridan (\\u201cWind River\\u201d) and the rock singer Hugh Dillon. The story centers on a powerful family in a fictional Michigan town whose economy is built around a large prison.\", \"ADELE ONE NIGHT ONLY 8:30 p.m. on CBS. Next week, the singer Adele is set to release \\u201c30,\\u201d her fourth studio album. She\\u2019ll perform tracks from that album, plus older material, in this two-hour special. The program will also feature Oprah Winfrey interviewing the singer.\"]","href_hash":"26edc938405c11eca0a867b628644f7e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"26edc938405c11eca0a867b628644f7e"}},
