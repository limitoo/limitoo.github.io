Then, shortly after, Smith went back on stage to accept the Oscar for \\\"Best Actor.\\\"\", \"In the days since the incident, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and Smith's peers have condemned his actions. Smith apologized to Rock on Monday, while Rock said during a stand-up show Wednesday night in Boston that he is still processing what happened.\", \"Following his public apology, Smith announced his resignation from the Academy on Friday \\u2014 and many were left wondering what the resignation would mean for the actor and his future.\\u00a0\", \"The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was founded in 1927 and the elite group began putting on the Academy Awards \\u2014 which dole out the Oscars \\u2014 in 1929, according to the Academy's website. It currently has 10,000 members who make up 17 branches of the movie-making industry ranging from writers and actors to make-up artists and public relations.\\u00a0\", \"Membership reviews take place once a year in the spring and those hoping to gain access must be sponsored by two members of the Academy currently in the branch they seek admission to. However, Academy Award nominees are automatically considered for membership and do not need sponsorship.\\u00a0\", \"Members of the Academy have access to many perks, including the right to vote for those nominated in their branch and a vote for Best Picture. They also receive exclusive access to screenings of nominated movies.\\u00a0\", \"When he resigned from the Academy, Smith gave up those aforementioned perks. His resignation, however, does not mean he will lose his Oscar for his role in \\\"King Richard.\\\" He can also be nominated again in the future and be invited back to the ceremony, according to Variety.\\u00a0\", \"But the Academy announced last week it is reviewing the incident and will hold a disciplinary meeting for the actor on April 18. Smith\\u00a0could be sanctioned\\u00a0if he is found to be at fault during the review, but it's not yet clear if the Academy would go as far as to take away the \\\"Best Actor\\\" award he won.\", \"Although several members have been expelled from the Academy in the past, including\\u00a0Harvey Weinstein, few have resigned. According to\\u00a0People, Peter Kurland, an Oscar-nominated sound mixer, and Tom Fleischman, an Oscar-winning recording mixer, resigned last month after the Academy decided to stop airing their portions of the show.\", \"Helen Ray is a social media manager for CBS News.
