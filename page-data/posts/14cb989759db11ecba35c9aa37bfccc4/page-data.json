But the world has changed, and for France and Germany the imperative of building what they call a \\u201csovereign Europe\\u201d has become overwhelming.\", \"So Mr. Scholz, who took over from Angela Merkel on Wednesday, chose France as his first foreign destination, not only because that tends to be what newly installed German chancellors do, but also because, as he said standing beside Mr. Macron in Paris Friday, \\u201cWe want to reinforce Europe, work together for European sovereignty.\\u201d\", \"The two men, who first met in Hamburg in 2014, held a working lunch at the presidential palace that reflected \\u201cthe essential need to meet quickly,\\u201d as Mr. Scholz put it afterward at a 20-minute news conference. \\u201cOur first exchanges demonstrated a solid convergence of views,\\u201d Mr. Macron said.\", \"Their tone was serious but convivial, with Mr. Macron referring repeatedly to \\u201cdear Olaf\\u201d and using the less formal \\u201ctu,\\u201d rather than \\u201cvous,\\u201d when addressing the chancellor. At the end of the news conference they fist-bumped \\u2014 a far cry from President Fran\\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl holding hands on the battlefield of Verdun in 1984, but a Covid-era indication of friendship.\", \"Mr. Scholz\\u2019s embrace of \\u201cEuropean sovereignty\\u201d was surely music to Mr. Macron\\u2019s ears, as he prepares to take over the rotating six-month presidency of the European Union on Jan. 1. The bloc faces an immediate crisis as Russia builds up troops on the Ukrainian border and the coronavirus pandemic refuses to wane.\", \"Asked about the Russian buildup, Mr. Scholz said, \\u201cIt is clear to all of us that there is no alternative to de-escalation.\\u201d Mr. Macron, who seemed skeptical of any imminent Russian threat, said, \\u201cWe must avoid all useless tension.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Macron\\u2019s vision for a Europe of \\u201cpower,\\u201d backed by real European military and technological capacity, tends toward the grandiose. Mr. Scholz may not like that style \\u2014 his coalition prefers the more prosaic \\u201cenhancing European capacity to act\\u201d \\u2014 but the general goal is intensely shared, perhaps more so than in the later Merkel years or at any time since the Cold War.\", \"The distance from shared goals to shared action in the European Union is always great because 27 countries have to be aligned. Still, the trauma of Covid-19 and its accompanying economic challenges have brought urgency, as has a sense of European vulnerability in a more unstable world where American leadership is no longer assured.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m more optimistic than I was with Ms. Merkel toward the end,\\u201d said Wolfgang Ischinger, a veteran German diplomat. \\u201cWe have a window of opportunity.\\u201d\", \"That window may be narrow. Any joint Franco-German plans could be rudely interrupted in April if Mr. Macron is defeated in the presidential election. He is the favorite, but if France lurched toward the ascendant nationalist hard right, all bets would be off. A German priority in the coming months will be to avoid that outcome, making accommodating gestures toward Mr. Macron more likely.\", \"France and Germany have always been the motor of European integration; when they stall, so does the whole project. Although the need to confront the pandemic brought budgetary breakthroughs, Europe has found itself in the shadow of Brexit and internal division while China rose and the United States turned its attention elsewhere.\", \"The 177-page coalition agreement of Mr. Scholz\\u2019s three-party government alludes to ultimate evolution toward a \\u201cfederal European state.\\u201d Mr. Macron, with the election in mind, has not gone that far \\u2014 the French attachment to the nation is fierce \\u2014 but the mere German mention of a United States of Europe suggests new boldness and revived ambition.\", \"Still, there are differences. Where Mr. Macron speaks of European \\u201cstrategic autonomy,\\u201d Mr. Scholz prefers \\u201cstrategic sovereignty.\\u201d The difference is not small.\", \"\\u201cGermans do not want strategic autonomy if that means independence from the United States,\\u201d said Cathryn Cl\\u00fcver, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations.\", \"The French president offered some de rigueur praise of NATO when laying out his European presidency program Thursday. He said it had proved its \\u201cusefulness.\\u201d But he broadly views European independence as an emancipation from the United States.\", \"Germany, intensely attached for historical reasons to the American anchor of European security, is wary of any strategic distancing from Washington. This view is broadly shared in several European Union states, including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, especially at a time when Russian troops are massed on the Ukrainian border.\", \"All this complicates both the meaning and the attainability of whatever European sovereignty may be.\", \"France and Germany share the view that they preserved a multilateral global system based on the rule of law and Western values while the United States, under former President Donald J. Trump, embraced nationalism and disparaged Europe.\", \"They have not been reassured by what they see as paltry consultation from the Biden administration on Afghanistan and the sale of nuclear submarines to Australia. They see a growing ideological and economic threat from China. Hence the determination to make a more independent and innovative Europe count.\", \"\\u201cThe last big European innovation was the euro,\\u201d said Mr. Ischinger. \\u201cSince then we have rested on our laurels. It\\u2019s time for the next round of innovation.\\u201d The euro was introduced almost two decades ago.\", \"Healing the pandemic-battered economy will be central to any European leap forward. Both leaders intimated Friday that they are prepared to build on the European Union\\u2019s groundbreaking $750 billion recovery fund, created 18 months ago to fight the ravages of the coronavirus.\", \"The deal broke with longstanding German economic orthodoxy by backing collective European debt, indicating a new willingness in Berlin to embrace greater fiscal flexibility.\", \"\\u201cThe recovery and reconstruction fund is a formidable example of what we can accomplish,\\u201d Mr. Scholz said. \\u201cAt the same time we must work on the solidity of our finances. This is not contradictory in my view.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Macron, as is his inclination, was bolder. He said Europe must adopt new rules, or find new flexibility, to ensure that the union moves toward full employment and \\u201cbuilds the channels of innovation and industry that will allow Europe to have a greener, more digital, and more sovereign economy, all of which implies massive investments.\\u201d\", \"The French president argued Thursday, before meeting Mr. Scholz, that the European Union\\u2019s stringent ceiling on annual budget deficits \\u2014 3 percent of a country\\u2019s gross domestic product \\u2014 should not stand in the way of ambitious investment strategies.\", \"\\u201cWe have to leave old taboos and old fetishes behind,\\u201d Mr. Macron said.\", \"Germany, whose perennial specters include the hyperinflation of the 1920s, would tend to regard fiscal discipline as a useful fetish.\", \"In general, while French proposals for a more powerful Europe tend toward soaring rhetoric, Germany is focused on the practical.\", \"Mr. Scholz\\u2019s coalition agreement calls for the introduction of qualified majority voting on foreign policy decisions \\u2014 a step that would likely make Europe far more effective in emergencies. France has not been prepared to accept this because of its attachment to national sovereignty and because its army, the most capable in the union following Britain\\u2019s departure, might be left with responsibility for a decision France did not endorse.\", \"Similarly, at the United Nations, where France has a permanent seat on the Security Council, \\u201cit rarely speaks as a European power, it speaks as France,\\u201d said Christoph Heusgen, the former chief policy adviser to Ms. Merkel and now president of the Munich Security Conference. \\u201cThe enthusiasm for Europe to speak with one voice stops there.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Scholz will spend the rest of the day in Brussels, at NATO and the European Commission \\u2014 also stops that are part of established German post-election protocol.\"]","href_hash":"14cb989759db11ecba35c9aa37bfccc4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"14cb989759db11ecba35c9aa37bfccc4"}},
