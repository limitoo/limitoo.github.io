Dummy rounds contain no gunpowder and are used to resemble bullets on camera.\", \"At about 11 a.m. on Oct. 21, Ms. Gutierrez-Reed, 24, loaded three firearms that were going to be used later that afternoon during a filming session, including the .45 Long Colt, her other lawyer, Robert Gorence, said. She then left the guns encased in socks to prevent passers-by from handling them and later went on a lunch break, leaving them unattended, he said.\", \"\\u201cWas there a duty to safeguard them 24/7?\\u201d Mr. Gorence said. \\u201cThe answer is no, because there were no live rounds.\\u201d\", \"Even though the gun was declared \\u201ccold,\\u201d meaning it was not supposed to contain any live ammunition, a live round was in the revolver that killed the movie\\u2019s cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, and wounded the director, Joel Souza. The key question in the investigation is how it got there.\", \"In interviews on the \\u201cToday\\u201d show and \\u201cGood Morning America\\u201d on Wednesday, Mr. Gorence and Mr. Bowles speculated that someone could have put a live round into the box of dummy rounds or in the gun itself while it was unattended, pointing to accounts of disgruntled crew members.\", \"Ms. Gutierrez-Reed\\u2019s lawyers\\u2019 account of the unattended guns appears to conflict with an affidavit released by the Santa Fe County sheriff\\u2019s office. While the armorer\\u2019s account, according to her lawyers, is that the gun was left unattended up to the point when it came into use on the set, the affidavit, which says it is based on interviews with Ms. Gutierrez-Reed and others, says that as the crew broke for lunch, the firearms were secured inside a safe on a \\u201cprop truck.\\u201d\", \"The affidavit cites Ms. Gutierrez-Reed as telling investigators she took the gun from the safe when she returned from lunch. But her lawyers on Wednesday said they needed to hear Ms. Gutierrez-Reed\\u2019s interview with the detective to try to explain that discrepancy.\", \"Mr. Bowles said that when Ms. Gutierrez-Reed returned from lunch, the film\\u2019s first assistant director, Dave Halls, asked for the firearm; Ms. Gutierrez-Reed then spun the gun\\u2019s cylinder and showed him all six rounds inside \\u2014 which she believed to all be dummies. Mr. Halls then entered the set, a wooden church, while Ms. Gutierrez-Reed remained outside because there were not supposed to be any gun discharges happening inside that she needed to be present for, the lawyer said.\", \"\\u201cHannah thinks the gun is secured,\\u201d Mr. Bowles said. \\u201cSo she goes and does her prop duties.\\u201d\", \"In addition to working as the film\\u2019s armorer, Ms. Gutierrez-Reed was a props assistant, which made it difficult for her to focus fully on her job as armorer, her lawyers have said. She was a nonunion worker and was on the set for about 17 days before the shooting occurred.\", \"Ms. Gutierrez-Reed\\u2019s first job as head armorer was on a western called \\u201cThe Old Way\\u201d starring Nicolas Cage, which was filmed this year, fueling concerns from colleagues on both that film and \\u201cRust\\u201d who worried she was too inexperienced for the job.\", \"Her lawyers disputed those claims, saying Ms. Gutierrez-Reed trained with her father \\u2014 the weapons expert Thell Reed \\u2014 from a young age, and that she would like to continue being an armorer.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019s a female, 24 years old in a male dominated profession,\\u201d Mr. Gorence said. \\u201cShe wants to work at what she\\u2019s been trained to do.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b53e3a943cc711ecb5f6000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b53e3a943cc711ecb5f6000017025a03"}},
