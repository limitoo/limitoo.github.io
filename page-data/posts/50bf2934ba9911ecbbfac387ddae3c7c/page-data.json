The NZDF will also deploy an eight-person team to Germany to help coordinate the flow of aid and supplies to Ukraine and will remain for at least three months.\", \"Chief of Defence Force Air Marshal Kevin Short says the aircraft is deploying with 20 maintenance people as well as the 50 personnel, to ensure it can operate wherever it is needed. He says the earliest the plane could be operating within Europe is expected to be Monday next week.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/117549/eight_col_Photo_1.jpg?1613360730\\\" alt=\\\"A Royal New Zealand Air Force C-130 Hercules will fly to Fiji.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nA Royal New Zealand Air Force C-130 Hercules (file image). \\nPhoto: Crown Copyright \\u00a9 NZDF.

New Zealand has moved at pace to provide significant support as the situation continues to evolve.\\\"\", \"Henare says at this point Cabinet has not considered sending LAVs. He says they looked at how tenable that would be but simply transporting, training, managing, repairing and servicing them would be \\\"exceptionally hard and exceptionally expensive\\\".\", \"He says New Zealand's contributions have been noted by partners including the UK and others internationally.\", \"Short says the people of Ukraine have been able to defend their country \\\"very well\\\".\", \"\\\"They've been able to that with the supply of both ammunition and systems and also intelligence to allow them to operate effectively. They have the morale, they have the will and they're fighting for their country. We're seeing Russia having to change its tactics and actually having to reconstitute to stay within this fight.\\\"\", \"Russia's ambassador has continued to refuse requests to brief MPs at the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committee, stoking further calls for him to be expelled.\", \"The impasse has prompted MPs to consider hauling the ambassador, Georgii Zuev, before Parliament to answer questions about his country's invasion of Ukraine, but that would be extraordinary - he has diplomatic immunity.\", \"She says New Zealand's position is very clear with the Russian Ambassador, and the select committee seeking to have him appear is seeking legal advice on whether he can be compelled to appear considering he has diplomatic immunity.\", \"She says she intends to let the committee go through its processes, and \\\"this is not the thing that is going to make the most tangible difference to those who are subject to this war, and that is the focus we have as a government\\\".\", \"She expects the committee will hear the legal advice and respond to that.\", \"\\\"In terms of what's going to make a difference to the people of Ukraine, it is much less likely to be those engagements with diplomats and more likely to be economic sanctions, the pressure on the Russian economy and the contribution to the war effort.\\\"\", \"Commentators including Waikato University international law professor Al Gillespie have also spoken about how the emergence of war crimes and crimes against humanity have changed the nature of the conflict.\", \"He said this could mean it is now justified for the government to consider sending weapons like New Zealand's javelin missiles or expelling lower-level officials from the Russian embassy.\", \"Ardern says people considering going to Ukraine to help fight would not be prosecuted, but New Zealand also cannot provide consular support in a war zone and the advice is not to travel.\"]","href_hash":"50bf2934ba9911ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"50bf2934ba9911ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
