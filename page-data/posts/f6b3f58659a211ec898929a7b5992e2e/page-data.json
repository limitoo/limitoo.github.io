A star of the HBO dramedies \\u201cThe White Lotus\\u201d and \\u201cLooking,\\u201d and the Netflix revival of \\u201cTales of the City,\\u201d he moved to Provincetown, Mass., two years ago. But he still stops in whenever he can.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m a groupie, really,\\u201d he said.\", \"Marlow & Sons is where he first learned to eat oysters. \\u201cI learned from the best place,\\u201d he said. And the week before, just as Marlow & Sons reopened for dinner, its chef, Ryoko Yoshida, had offered to teach him how to shuck them.\", \"Ms. Yoshida had also lent him a book, Mark Kurlansky\\u2019s \\u201cThe Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell,\\u201d to fill him on the bivalve\\u2019s cultural history. He hadn\\u2019t read it yet. But that morning, dressed in the grays and browns of a forest in winter, he was eager to get to work.\", \"He met Ms. Yoshida behind the stone bar and she handed him a taupe apron and a small, plastic-handled knife. Behind them sat a platter of ice, mounded with dozens of Eel Lake oysters imported from Nova Scotia, their whorled shells colored brown and taupe.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re very plump and have a very nice salinity, a beautiful mineral finish,\\u201d she said.\", \"She and David McQueen, the restaurant\\u2019s director of operations, had also provided sliced lemons and a mignonette of shallots and vinegar. A plate of fresh bread and salted butter were set out nearby.\", \"Mr. McQueen asked if Mr. Barlett had ever shucked an oyster before. He had not.\", \"\\u201cHow are you with knives in general?\\u201d Mr. McQueen asked.\", \"\\u201cI cook a lot,\\u201d he replied. \\u201cOften with blunt knives. I get into a slightly meditative state when I cook, and so I feel like I will slip and cut myself if it\\u2019s too sharp.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis should be fun!\\u201d Ms. Yoshida said.\", \"With effortless friendliness and a smoldering smile that makes his mustache dance, Mr. Bartlett seems to find most things fun. An Australian who immigrated to the United States in the early 2000s, he broke out with an episode of \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d and didn\\u2019t catch another real break for years.\", \"But his roles as Dom in \\u201cLooking\\u201d and Mouse in \\u201cTales of the City\\u201d \\u2014 both gay men confronting a younger generation and its mores \\u2014 made a mark. That mustache helped. And his turn as Armond, the decompensating manager of a luxury resort in \\u201cThe White Lotus\\u201d solidified his one-to-watch status, just as he approached 50.\", \"He thinks he knows why it took him so long. He spent years trying to give casting directors what he believed they wanted. Finally, in his 40s, he began to give himself. Mindful of stereotypes, he feels a particular responsibility to portray gay characters with full complexity and humanity, even if that humanity takes him to some strange places, as in the pas de deux between Armond and a suitcase in \\u201cThe White Lotus\\u201d finale.\", \"\\u201cThis is not a character that holds back,\\u201d he said.\", \"Behind the bar, Ms. Yoshida showed him how to hold an oyster, pointing out the hinge, where the knife would enter, and the adductor muscle, which would need to be sliced at its top and bottom. Wrapping one hand in a dish towel, she gripped her oyster, and then with her other hand, used the knife to wriggle through the hinge. The oyster popped open, audibly.\", \"Holding the oyster flat so that the liquor didn\\u2019t run out, she showed how to check for dirt and bits of shell. Then she plucked the top off (\\u201cThe reveal!\\u201d Mr. McQueen said) and offered Mr. Bartlett the oyster.\", \"\\u201cOh wow,\\u201d Mr. Bartlett said, swallowing. \\u201cThat\\u2019s really good. The flavor seems delicate, subtle. It\\u2019s lovely.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Bartlett took his turn. With a death grip on the knife he approached the hinge and promptly broke off a bit of shell. Ms. Yoshida told him to keep going. And to put more force into it. \\u201cThere we go,\\u201d he said, popping it open. With the top off, he placed the oyster on a mound of damp salt.\", \"Mr. McQueen offered him a shucking job. \\u201cIf this acting thing doesn\\u2019t work out,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m down,\\u201d Mr. Bartlett said. \\u201cLike shuck one. Eat one. Not terrible.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cGet to work!\\u201d Ms. Yoshida said.\", \"Mr. Bartlett opened more oysters, quickly and without error. \\u201cBecause I broke the first one, I\\u2019m overcompensating,\\u201d he said.\", \"Once he had shucked half a dozen, he surveyed his harvest \\u2014 even the one with the broken shell, which he referred to as \\u201cmy shame oyster\\u201d \\u2014 and then sat down to eat.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m going to eat my shame,\\u201d he said. And did. \\u201cDelicious,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou can taste the ocean. It feels like the ocean in a way that nothing else really does.\\u201d\", \"Mr. McQueen told him that now he could head to any of Cape Cod\\u2019s celebrated oyster farms and buy a fresh sack. \\u201cI\\u2019ve always wanted to do that,\\u201d Mr. Bartlett said.\", \"And a few days later, on Thanksgiving, he did. \\u201cYes I wanted to show off my new shucking skills!\\u201d he wrote in an email. \\u201cApparently I\\u2019m an impressive shucker.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f6b3f58659a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f6b3f58659a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}},
