When the Taliban arrived in August 2021,\\u00a0she knew she had to flee. What followed were two months of terror and uncertainty as she and her young family desperately searched\\u00a0for a way out of Afghanistan. This is her story, as told to Claudia Taranto for Earshot\", \"I know the Taliban are closing in on Mazar-i-Sharif but I distract myself by turning up the music, dancing and ironing my new dresses.\", \"My father works for the provincial government. One day he calls and says, \\\"We have been sold out by our government. Ghezal, run away.\\\"\", \"Along with my husband Shiwa and our two small children, I run through the deserted streets to a relative's house.\", \"The next day, I return home to collect a few items and see a man in a Taliban turban and robes talking to a neighbour and pointing at my house.\", \"I know for sure the Taliban are after me. A local pharmacist tells me that two government employees have already been shot dead in our street.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/67f84761dcaa698ad351c1f84f7457fe\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Ghezal\\u00a0knew the Taliban would target her for her work as a journalist.\\u00a0(Supplied)</div>\", \"After a few days, our relatives ask us to leave. They're worried that we're making them a target for the Taliban. So we pay a lot of money and catch a plane to Kabul to join our friends, Baktash and Seena, who are civil society activists.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Our city falls</div>\", \"We think we'll\\u00a0have about three months before the Taliban arrive\\u00a0in Kabul, enough time to escape the country.\", \"But the following night, we get the news that our city, Mazar-i-Sharif, has\\u00a0fallen. I cry as my friends send\\u00a0through photos of the Taliban's white flag flying across the city skyline.\", \"Then I take a call from a very trusted source saying that President Ashraf Ghani has skipped the country.\", \"We're all in shock as the\\u00a0neighbours come rushing in, telling Baktash and Seena to burn their documents and hide their laptops and hard drives. They also tell them to clear all the photos of their daughters off the walls \\u2013 the Taliban do not allow images of women to be displayed.\", \"That night, I think that Kabul will be overwhelmed by fighting and that we will all die. I don't want my children to experience that terror just before they die, so I put them to bed, hoping the bombing happens while they're asleep.\", \"Then we turn up the music, playing patriotic songs. We sing, we cry, we shout. We're out of our minds.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/1eb17b4a36e70c50107f6f67a22c341f\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Although Ghezal\\u00a0knew the Taliban may take Kabul, she thought she would have plenty of time to escape.(Supplied\\u00a0)</div>\", \"We wake up the next morning to a neighbour knocking at the door. The Taliban are going door-to-door searching houses, we can see them from our window. We panic.\", \"Baktash and Shiwa change into white Muslim-style robes and we debate whether they should hide in the kitchen cupboards or flee onto the streets. Then a relative from overseas calls, urging me to take my documents and go to the airport.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">A nightmare at the airport</div>\", \"The next day, we join thousands of desperate people at the airport gate. I hear an American soldier saying, \\\"Fuck you, fuck you\\\". I'm shocked to hear him speaking so rudely to the crowd.\", \"Then I hear gunshots behind me. Five or six soldiers are firing into the air. My son cries out, saying a bullet has hit his finger and his back. I'm very scared as I examine him and realise he'd been burnt by the casing of a bullet. I shout at the soldiers to stop firing. In that moment, I feel broken.\", \"Then suddenly everything is red and people are rushing and pushing us. I fall over, I can't breathe. Our eyes are burning from the tear gas. I feel guilty for bringing my children here. They will have nightmares about the airport for weeks afterwards. A young boy gives us some water to wash our eyes.\", \"That night, we crowd into a safehouse where my mother, a human rights worker, is hiding.\", \"The next day, I'm able to convince a man who runs a safehouse for journalists to take us in. It's a four-storey building with a network of rooms, one family living in each. I spend the next six weeks working late into the night:\\u00a0filling out forms, scanning documents, trying to get us visas to a Western country.\", \"During the day, children play noisily in the corridors and the wives of the other journalists socialise, gossip and dance. Their husbands are seeking visas for them, so they are carefree. They urge me to join them but I can't, I'm too stressed.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f751b8b13b9600fb43de3989d0f3707a\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Shiwa and Ghezal knew their lives were at stake if they stayed in Afghanistan.\\u00a0(Supplied\\u00a0)</div>\", \"But meeting them, I realise the less you know, the more you live and the more you know, the less you live.\", \"As the weeks pass with no success, I become extremely anxious and have many migraines.\", \"Sneaking peeks from behind the curtain, I can see that the streets of Kabul are gradually returning to normal. Shops and schools are opening, cars appear again on the streets. But there are no women.\", \"It breaks my heart as I realise that whenever any change happens in Afghanistan, it always affects women first.\", \"The situation is grave. I follow the news of journalists being targeted by the Taliban and women's protests being shut down. I live in fear of the safehouse being raided\\u00a0at any moment. I consider travelling overland to the Pakistani border and taking my chances in Pakistan as a refugee but the risks and the price are too high.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">An escape but at what cost?</div>\", \"A German human rights worker I knew\\u00a0in Mazar-i-Sharif texts. He's surprised to learn I'm still in Afghanistan and he offers to help.\", \"We put together a small network of friends from the UK, North America\\u00a0and Europe on Signal and they help to progress my application for a visa to Germany, sponsored by PEN International.\", \"A few weeks later, we find out we've been granted visas for Germany. While I feel elated in that moment, I also feel hopeless.\", \"While I am grateful for the kindness so many people have shown us, it also hurts to be so helpless. But I have to do this for my children who deserve a better life, not to see their parents shot or see people hung in the street.\", \"The next day, I nervously cover myself completely in a burqa so that nobody will recognise me and go to the bazaar to buy some luggage and toiletries for the trip.\\u00a0Later, the night before\\u00a0I leave the safehouse, I join the other women and we dance.\", \"On my final day in my country, I return to the bazaar to eat Afghani street food for the last time with my brother. I have to fight back the tears. It hurts so much to say goodbye to him.\", \"I spend my final night in Afghanistan back in my mother's safehouse, with my parents and siblings.\", \"Being a woman who does not follow society's rules, who chooses her own path, it has forced me to be tough, to shut off from my emotions. I find it so hard to hug my family, to be soft and loving with them. I don't want to show them how much I'm going to miss them, so I pretend to be happy.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ec4b3e18a5f3178d403a5b1ab1ddc4a0\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The couple have escaped Afghanistan and now live in Germany.\\u00a0(Supplied)</div>\", \"The next day, we fly to Pakistan where we'll be processed by the German embassy. I'm shocked to see how free the young people are, wearing jeans, couples holding hands in the street. The Pakistan government trained and backed the Taliban and yet their people live a peaceful life.\", \"And while I finally feel free in Pakistan \\u2014 eating KFC and Pizza Hut, taking the children to the park \\u2014 I also feel guilty about the family I left behind in Afghanistan, struggling for food.\", \"Weeks later, we are on a plane flying to Hanover and our new life.\", \"Ghezal's parents and some of her siblings received visas for\\u00a0Albania, others have remained in Afghanistan. She plans to write a memoir and is learning to speak German.\"]","href_hash":"6dd6476a749d11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6dd6476a749d11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
