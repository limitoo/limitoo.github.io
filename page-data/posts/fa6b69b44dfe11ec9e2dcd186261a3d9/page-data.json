So it\\u2019s appropriate that the violinist Joshua Bell is appearing this week with the New York Philharmonic.\", \"Bell is one of classical music\\u2019s biggest, most salable stars, and he tours diligently. But he doesn\\u2019t take on new work with the enthusiasm of Ren\\u00e9e Fleming, or unveil splashy unions of Bach and social justice like Yo-Yo Ma. Less noticed by the press than those two \\u2014 and many others far less famous \\u2014 Bell just plays, rarely veering these days from the absolute center of the standard repertory.\", \"But if he just plays, that playing is almost uncannily lovely. On Wednesday at Alice Tully Hall, he made not a single ugly sound in Beethoven\\u2019s Violin Concerto. At 53, his face remains preternaturally youthful, and his tone is similarly unlined. If the solo part in this work is often an exuberant unspooling of golden wire, Bell\\u2019s wire was always gleaming and smooth, never thin or cutting.\", \"When he wasn\\u2019t playing, he swayed a bit to the orchestral accompaniment, and sometimes turned from the audience entirely to take in the mass of musicians. (While Jaap van Zweden, the Philharmonic\\u2019s music director, was on the podium at Tully, Bell, who has led the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields for almost 10 years, is by now used to leading an ensemble while soloing.) At one point he even made a tiny, enthusiastic stomp on the stage.\", \"But while Bell is a genial partner for an ensemble, there is something sedate about him \\u2014 always enjoyable, never intense or unexpected. He is, for better and worse, dependability itself.\", \"He came closest to surprising in the cadenza he created for the first movement, which had ruminative dissonances and lively string crossings. But you would have to be generous to describe even this as truly passionate.\", \"The Philharmonic played with mahogany-rich ardor in the strings in that opening movement, and its winds were graceful in the second. In the third, van Zweden paced a burnished Allegro, more aristocratic than fun or wild. That seemed just fine for Bell, whose playing smiles but never grins, and certainly never loses its cool.\", \"The program was an inversion of the usual ordering of a concert\\u2019s halves. The Beethoven concerto, at 45 minutes the most substantial work, sat alone before intermission; after the pause came Chen Yi\\u2019s brief but meaty and varied \\u201cDuo Ye\\u201d for chamber orchestra, then Stravinsky\\u2019s 25-minute \\u201cPulcinella\\u201d Suite.\", \"Those last two pieces played well together. Written in the 1980s and inspired by a folk performance Chen attended around a bonfire in a Chinese village, \\u201cDuo Ye\\u201d has vitality in passages for sharp, crisp percussion and mystery in its dreamy duet of violas and vibraphone. Perhaps it was the program\\u2019s juxtaposition, but Stravinsky seemed in the air: Some moments in \\u201cDuo Ye\\u201d evoked a friendlier \\u201cRite of Spring,\\u201d others the woodblock-stark angularity of \\u201cLes Noces\\u201d \\u2014 both pieces which, like Chen\\u2019s, locate in the primitive a genesis of modernism.\", \"\\u201cPulcinella\\u201d was also a modernist\\u2019s look back \\u2014 but to the graceful energy of early 18th-century Italian music, which Stravinsky transposed into airy yet tender arrangements. Including bright, buoyant playing by the flutist Alison Fierst and by the featured string quintet at the work\\u2019s center, the eight sections on Wednesday had holiday conviviality.\"]","href_hash":"fa6b69b44dfe11ec9e2dcd186261a3d9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fa6b69b44dfe11ec9e2dcd186261a3d9"}},
