The sounds of a beam-me-up transporter wafted across the room. Over his shoulder, a wall was filled with an enormous photograph of his father \\u2014 Leonard Nimoy, who played Spock on the show \\u2014 dressed in his Starfleet uniform, his fingers splayed in the familiar Vulcan \\u201clive long and prosper\\u201d greeting.\", \"But that gesture, Adam Nimoy noted as he led a visitor through this exhibition at the Skirball Cultural Center, was more than a symbol of the television series that defined his father\\u2019s long career playing the part-Vulcan, part-human Spock. It is derived from part of a Hebrew blessing that Leonard Nimoy first glimpsed at an Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Boston as a boy and brought to the role.\", \"The prominently displayed photo of that gesture linking Judaism to Star Trek culture helps account for what might seem to be a highly illogical bit of programming: the decision by the Skirball, a Jewish cultural center known mostly for its explorations of Jewish life and history, to bring in an exhibition devoted to one of television\\u2019s most celebrated sci-fi shows.\", \"But walking through the artifacts Adam Nimoy recalled how his father, the son of Ukrainian Jews who spoke no English when they arrived, had said he identified with Spock, pointing out that he was \\u201cthe only alien on the bridge of the Enterprise.\\u201d\", \"Jewish values and traditions were often on the minds of the show\\u2019s writers as they dealt with issues of human behavior and morality, said David Gerrold, a writer whose credits include \\u201cThe Trouble with Tribbles,\\u201d one of the most acclaimed \\u201cStar Trek\\u201d episodes, which introduces the crew to a cute, furry, rapidly reproducing alien life form.\", \"\\u201cA lot of Jewish tradition \\u2014 a lot of Jewish wisdom \\u2014 is part of \\u2018Star Trek,\\u2019 and \\u2018Star Trek\\u2019 drew on a lot of things that were in the Old Testament and the Talmud,\\u201d Gerrold said in an interview. \\u201cAnyone who is very literate in Jewish tradition is going to recognize a lot of wisdom that \\u2018Star Trek\\u2019 encompassed.\\u201d\", \"That connection was not explicit when the show first aired. And a stroll through the exhibition, which covers the original television show as well as some of the spinoffs and films that came to encompass the \\u201cStar Trek\\u201d industry, mainly turns up items that are of interest to \\u201cStar Trek\\u201d fans. There is a navigation console from the U.S.S. Enterprise, the first script from the first episode, a Klingon disrupter from \\u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation,\\u201d and a display of tribbles.\", \"To some extent, the choice of this particular exhibition \\u2014 \\u201cStar Trek: Exploring New Worlds\\u201d \\u2014 to help usher the Skirball back into operation after a Covid shutdown reflects the imperatives museums everywhere are facing as they try to recover from a pandemic that has been so economically damaging. \\u201cThese days \\u2014 honestly, especially after the pandemic \\u2014 museums are looking for ways to get people through the door,\\u201d said Brooks Peck, who helped create the show for the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle. \\u201cMuseums are struggling to find an audience and are looking for a pop culture hook.\\u201d\", \"It seems to have worked. The \\u201cStar Trek\\u201d exhibition has drawn 12,000 attendees in its first two months here, a robust turnout given that the Skirball is limiting sales to 25 percent of capacity.\", \"\\u201cThis has been bringing in new people, no question,\\u201d said Sheri Bernstein, the museum director. \\u201cAttendance is important for the sake of relevance. It\\u2019s important for us to bring in a diverse array of people.\\u201d\", \"Jessie Kornberg, the president of Skirball, said that the center had been drawn by the parallels between Judaism and the television show. \\u201cNimoy\\u2019s Jewish identity contributed to a small moment which became a big theme,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe actually think the common values in the \\u2018Star Trek\\u2019 universe and Jewish belief are more powerful than that symbolism. That\\u2019s this idea of a more liberal, inclusive people, where \\u2018other\\u2019 and \\u2018difference\\u2019 is an embraced strength as opposed to a divisive weakness.\\u201d\", \"The intersections between the television series and Judaism begin with its two stars, Nimoy and William Shatner, who played Capt. James T. Kirk. \\u201cThese are two iconic guys in outer space who are Jewish,\\u201d said Adam Nimoy. And it extends to the philosophy that infuses the show, created by Gene Roddenberry, who was raised a Southern Baptist but came to consider himself a humanist, according to his authorized biography.\", \"Those underlying connections are unmistakable for people like Nimoy, 65, a television director who is both a devoted \\u201cStar Trek\\u201d fan and an observant Jew: He and his father often went to services in Los Angeles, and Friday night Sabbath dinners were a regular part of their family life.\", \"Nimoy found no shortage of Jewish resonances and echoes in the exhibition, which opened in October and closes on Feb. 20. He stopped at a costume worn by a Gorn, a deadly reptilian extraterrestrial who was in a fight-to-the-death encounter with Kirk.\", \"\\u201cWhen he gets the Gorn to the ground, he\\u2019s about to kill him,\\u201d Nimoy recounted. \\u201cThe Gorn wants to kill Kirk. But something happens. Instead he shows mercy and restraint and refuses to kill the Gorn.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cVery similar to the story of Joseph,\\u201d Nimoy said, referring to the way Joseph, in the biblical book of Genesis, declined to seek retribution against his brothers for selling him into slavery.\", \"Leonard Nimoy died in 2015 at the age of 83. Shatner, who is 90 and recently became the oldest person to go into space, declined to discuss the exhibition. \\u201cUnfortunately Mr. Shatner\\u2019s overcommitted production schedule precludes him from taking on any additional interviews,\\u201d said his assistant, Kathleen Hays.\", \"The Skirball Cultural Center is set on 15 acres, about 20 miles from downtown Los Angeles.\", \"The exhibition ran for about two years in Seattle after opening in 2016 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the original \\u201cStar Trek\\u201d TV show\\u2019s 1966 debut. (That version was on NBC for three seasons.) The exhibition had been intended to tour, but those plans were cut short when the pandemic began to close museums across the country.\", \"The exhibition was assembled largely from the private collection of Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft and founder of the Museum of Pop Culture, who died in 2018.\", \"Peck said he wanted to commemorate the anniversary of the series with an exhibition that explored the outsize influence the television show had on American culture. \\u201cThe answer that I am offering is that \\u2018Star Trek\\u2019 has endured and inspired people because of the optimistic future it presents \\u2014 the good character of many of its characters,\\u201d Peck said. \\u201cThey are characters that people would like to emulate.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSkirball faced a bit of a challenge in trying to explain to its audience how \\u2018Star Trek' fit in with what they do,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHappily it completely worked out. I had always hoped that Skirball could take it. Skirball\\u2019s values as an institution so align with the values of \\u2018Star Trek\\u2019 and the \\u2018Star Trek\\u2019 community.\\u201d\", \"Bernstein, the Skirball director, said the exhibition seemed a particularly good way to help bring the museum back to life.\", \"\\u201cThere was never a better time to present this show than now,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe very much liked the idea of reopening our full museum offerings with a show that was about inspiring hope. A show that promised enjoyment.\\u201d\", \"By spring, \\u2018Star Trek\\u2019 will step aside for a less surprising offering, an exhibition about Jewish delis, but for now, the museum is filled both with devotees of Jewish culture, admiring a Torah case from China, and Trekkies, snapping pictures of the captain\\u2019s chair that Kirk sat in aboard the Enterprise.\", \"\\u201cThere is no such thing as too much \\u2018Star Trek,\\u2019\\u201d Scott Mantz, a film critic, said as he began interviewing Adam Nimoy after a recent screening at the museum of \\u201cFor the Love of Spock,\\u201d a 2016 documentary Nimoy had made about his father. A long burst of applause rose from his audience.\"]","href_hash":"d6ceae586d6611eca8cf25b26f9b21f9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d6ceae586d6611eca8cf25b26f9b21f9"}},
