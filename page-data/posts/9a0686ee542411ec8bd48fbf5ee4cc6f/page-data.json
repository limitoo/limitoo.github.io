Many in the sweepstakes industry have already added Smith to their short list of year-end award candidates for his portrayal of a flawed, formidable Black man in a very white world, devoted to a dream for his family.\", \"In the former, the 53-year-old Smith has produced a book at once disarmingly vulnerable and smoothly self-protective, because he wants to take a break from playing. Playing, that is, anyone other than the Will Smith in midlife he would now like the world to understand. \\u201cOf course,\\u201d he says, with the upbeat confidence that propelled him as a middle-class Philadelphia Black kid in the 1980s from rapper to TV star to one of today\\u2019s most bankable international Hollywood commodities, \\u201cthere\\u2019s the red-carpet-walking, fly-car-driving, tight-fade-wearing, box-office-record-breaking, hot-chick-marrying, \\u2018I Am Legend\\u2019-pull-up-doing, jiggy-ass \\u2018Will Smith.\\u2019 \\u2026 And then there\\u2019s me. This book is about me.\\u201d\", \"Within bounds. Smith shares a byline with Mark Manson, the popular self-help blogger and mega-selling author of \\u201cThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\\u2014,\\u201d a correspondingly famous literary collaborator presumably selected by the star\\u2019s management team. Sweet irony: Part of Smith\\u2019s jiggy-ass appeal as a one-man entertainment juggernaut has always been his cocky, sunny admission that he has always given many sincere f\\u2014s about his reign as a box-office-record-breaking star, with all its fly-car-driving perks. \\u201cI wanted to be Eddie Murphy in \\u2018Star Wars,\\u2019\\u201d he declares, early in his career game plan. With the coin-jingling success of \\u201cMen in Black,\\u201d \\u201cHitch,\\u201d \\u201cI Am Legend\\u201d and \\u201cHancock,\\u201d he is. The book title matches the man\\u2019s drive.\", \"\\u201cWill\\u201d positions the star for whatever choices he makes next \\u2014 in his private life, too. He says he used to be a coward, driven to please all the people all the time as a form of self-protection. Now, he says, he\\u2019s gotta be Will.\", \"To the point: The complexities of his 23-year marriage to the actor Jada Pinkett Smith have long been a topic of tabloid scrutiny. Now self-actualized, Smith declares that he and his wife are committed to each other in an open marriage that best supports their notions of \\u201crelational perfection.\\u201d Let entertainment/gossip sites do their part in tossing the word salad; the guy leaves it at that. He reports that in the course of doing the painful inner work to become what his Jungian-trained therapist calls a \\u201cFreestanding Man,\\u201d he participated in many psychedelic ayahuasca ceremonies in Peru. He also reports that the same therapist dubbed Smith\\u2019s nice-guy persona \\u201cUncle Fluffy.\\u201d Awww, Jungians.\", \"This is a beseeching memoir; it is also an ironclad work of image management rolled out during Oscar season. In Hollywood, the two aims are compatible. But for the delights of what happens when a deft insider with delicious stories to tell truly doesn\\u2019t give a diddly squat, there is no fresher or more entertaining entry this season than SOLID IVORY: Memoirs (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 399 pp., $30), by the elegant writer-director James Ivory.\", \"Advanced age works in Ivory\\u2019s favor. The stage is all his at 93, and he is a master raconteur. (Three years ago, he became the oldest winner ever of an Academy Award for his adapted screenplay of \\u201cCall Me by Your Name.\\u201d) And with Oscar nominations for directing \\u201cA Room With a View,\\u201d \\u201cHowards End\\u201d and \\u201cThe Remains of the Day,\\u201d his reputation is safely burnished: The phrase \\u201cMerchant Ivory Productions\\u201d forever signifies a genre of literate, refined, aesthetically sumptuous, slightly tremulous art-house movies made for half a century with the producer Ismail Merchant, Ivory\\u2019s partner in work and life, and their longtime screenwriting collaborator, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.\", \"But late-life ease alone does not account for the charm \\u2014 and, more specifically, the nonchalant, assured, gay sexiness \\u2014 of this unusual collection of autobiographical anecdotes, character sketches and observations. The novelist Peter Cameron is the astute editor here, having worked with Ivory over a number of years to polish these gems, some of them recut from past letters, some of them previously published by Cameron\\u2019s own exquisite, handcrafted Shrinking Violet Press.\", \"Adopted into a prosperous family who made a nice life out of the lumber business in Klamath Falls, Ore., Ivory describes himself as a young boy apparently always at ease with his sexuality. And, beginning with stories of childhood exploration when he was a lad at parochial school, the memoirist goes on to recollect a photo album\\u2019s worth of men (with album photos, too) who were friends or lovers, recalling his younger days with all the panache of a Cole Porter song, if Porter also wrote deft lyrics about male genitalia.\", \"It works, this candid/sometimes naughty/always knowing sashay. There\\u2019s a warmth to his earthiness about his personal life (with a respectful cloak of privacy over the details of his centrally important, four-decade relationship with Merchant, who died in 2005). There is a calm self-assessment of how he operates as a director, with anecdotes from various productions. And scattered throughout, there are perfect, martini-dry vignettes of various people who have passed through his rather marvelous life, including the once-powerful movie critic Pauline Kael, with her \\u201chigh-pitched, little girl-of-good-family, shaking voice\\u201d; Vanessa Redgrave, who starred in the 1984 Merchant Ivory adaptation of Henry James\\u2019s \\u201cThe Bostonians\\u201d \\u2014 \\u201cBrave, noble, wrongheaded being!\\u201d; and the mysteriously alluring late travel writer Bruce Chatwin, \\u201ca beautiful, soft child who\\u2019s not quite real,\\u201d with whom he had a casual three-year affair. Oh, there is so much good stuff here!\", \"There\\u2019s OK stuff in YOURS CRUELLY, ELVIRA: Memoirs of the Mistress of the Dark (Hachette, 284 pp., $29), by Cassandra Peterson, i.e., the real woman behind the curvy, kitschy goth cult character she has played for decades on TV, with a pop combination of bazooms and bemusement. Parked toward the end of Peterson\\u2019s wiseacre memoir of a life of unlikely, long-running fame is the announcement that, after she and her husband of 25 years split up, she has been in a romantic relationship with a woman for nearly two decades. She\\u2019s already a gay fan favorite for her drag-queen sensibilities, so this is hardly a 70-year-old bombshell\\u2019s bombshell. Still, it\\u2019s a nice use of memoir as a coming-out party, and everyone with a nostalgic fondness for Elvira is happy that Cassandra Peterson is happy.\", \"There\\u2019s not much stuff at all in ACT LIKE YOU GOT SOME SENSE: And Other Things My Daughters Taught Me (Grand Central, 221 pp., $30) for anyone who isn\\u2019t a hard-core devotee of the actor-comedian Jamie Foxx, who cobbled this memoir together with the journalist Nick Chiles. The parenting advice Foxx offers, scattered in a barrage of comedy riffs and career highlights, boils down to, Don\\u2019t be a jerk \\u2014 like I often am. Then he blows a chapter naming all the famous people his kids have been lucky to meet because he\\u2019s their famous dad. Still, it\\u2019s a nice use of memoir as a recycling depot for material that didn\\u2019t work out in \\u201cDad Stop Embarrassing Me!,\\u201d the short-lived Netflix show he dreamed up with his older daughter, Corinne Foxx.\", \"Group therapy is a classic use of celebrity memoir, and two books about brothers offer a useful contrasting study in the effects of Hollywood on happy and unhappy kinfolk. THE BOYS: A Memoir of Hollywood and Family (Morrow/HarperCollins, 393 pp., $28.99) is as kind, imperturbable and appreciative a reminiscence as one might expect from the child-star-turned-director Ron Howard and his younger child-star-turned-character-actor brother, Clint Howard. The boys\\u2019 parents, Rance and Jean Howard \\u2014 born Harold Beckenholdt and Jean Speegle \\u2014 moved the family from Oklahoma to New York and then to California, propelled by their own aspirations as actors. But with the immediate stardom of little Ronny on \\u201cThe Andy Griffith Show\\u201d and young Clint\\u2019s own TV spotlight in \\u201cGentle Ben,\\u201d the senior Howards appear to have embraced and supported their boys\\u2019 successes with grace and practicality.\", \"\\u201cOur parents\\u2019 own show-business aspirations were never realized as fully as ours, yet neither of them ever articulated or even telegraphed any bitterness or resentment toward us. They were show people but they weren\\u2019t narcissists. They were stage parents but they weren\\u2019t monsters,\\u201d writes Ron \\u2014 the older, straight-arrow brother with the bigger career, from star of \\u201cHappy Days\\u201d to Oscar-winning director of \\u201cA Beautiful Mind.\\u201d \\u201cI put Mom and Dad through their unfair share of hell in my teens and early adulthood by getting loaded and carrying on like an idiot,\\u201d writes Clint \\u2014 the rebellious kid brother, who deals head-on here with past substance abuse. Jean Howard died in 2000, Rance Howard passed away in 2017, and these alternating narratives, shaped with the collaboration of the journalist David Kamp, have the lulling rhythms of harmonious boomer sibs clearing out the old family house. See, they seem to say, brotherly love is possible in Hollywood.\", \"Not so fast, says Nick Davis in COMPETING WITH IDIOTS (Knopf, 362 pp., $30). The subtitle of this unavoidably depressing study in fraternal cruelty at the highest Hollywood level \\u2014 and its effect on family yea unto generations \\u2014 is \\u201cHerman and Joe Mankiewicz: A Dual Portrait.\\u201d And even if we think we have read and heard everything we need to know about these two outsize characters from the golden age of Ruthless, Crude, Undeniably Talented Tinseltown Schmucks (most recently in \\u201cMank,\\u201d David Fincher\\u2019s 2020 biographical drama about Herman and the making of \\u201cCitizen Kane\\u201d), Davis says, hold on. He is Herman\\u2019s grandson. He grew up knowing Great-Uncle Joe. His mother, Johanna Mankiewicz Davis, Herman\\u2019s only daughter, was killed by a New York City taxicab in 1974, when she was 36 and he was 9. Everything still hurts. And bewilders. He would like to look into the story himself.\", \"As he does so, the title \\u2014 taken from the famous punchline of Herman\\u2019s telegram to the New York writer Ben Hecht urging him to come west and get rich in Hollywood, where \\u201cmillions are to be grabbed\\u201d \\u2014 becomes a mournful commentary on Herman, Joe, relatives, actors, enablers, connivers, drunks, adulterers, liars, the whole damn showbiz lot of them. Davis\\u2019s narrative style is personal and conversational. It also occasionally falls into the iffy thing of expressing the inner thoughts of people whose inner thoughts he couldn\\u2019t possibly know. Maybe this book serves as the writer\\u2019s own therapeutic project. Certainly as a third-generation member, he has the benefit of more distance from the emotional carnage than his mother and uncles before him. And still he asks, Does it matter who wrote what in \\u201cCitizen Kane\\u201d? And he answers, \\u201cIf it doesn\\u2019t matter to a well-adjusted, mystical spiritual being who is trying to live her life in accordance with the truest values of life on this planet, it does matter to the biographer, and it matters to the grandson.\\u201d\", \"So here\\u2019s an idea: Gather everyone left who still wants in on the family Mankiewicz project to write an oral history together. The group memoir is really popular in Hollywood books these days, and really fun for readers who are fond of the subject being orally historicized in the first place.\", \"Fans of \\u201cThe Office,\\u201d for instance \\u2014 I refer to the surprisingly sprightly, self-sustaining American remake of the original, brilliantly cringe-y BBC workplace comedy of the same name \\u2014 will enjoy WELCOME TO DUNDER MIFFLIN: The Ultimate Oral History of \\u201cThe Office\\u201d (Custom House, 441 pp., $29.99), by Brian Baumgartner (who played Kevin) and Ben Silverman. Did you know Bob Odenkirk was in serious consideration for the role of the obtuse office boss Michael Scott made so memorable by Steve Carell? I didn\\u2019t.\", \"Myself, I will be reading and rereading WOKE UP THIS MORNING: The Definitive Oral History of \\u201cThe Sopranos\\u201d (Morrow/HarperCollins, 509 pp., $30). Because it\\u2019s what it is! The project evolved out of the pandemic podcast \\u201cTalking Sopranos,\\u201d presided over by Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa \\u2014 that\\u2019s Christopher Moltisanti and Bobby \\u201cBacala\\u201d Baccalieri, in the universe of one of the 21st century\\u2019s greatest televised achievements. (Where better to hide out during lockdown than on the couch rewatching all 86 episodes of \\u201cThe Sopranos\\u201d?) It\\u2019s been over two decades since audiences first met the suburban family man and mobster Tony Soprano, played by the late, much-missed James Gandolfini. But these rollicking gabfests, proceeding episode by episode and smoothed out for the page by Philip Lerman, bring together nearly everyone, on screen and off, who made the series a creative and cultural landmark. The freely offered admiration expressed by so many for their missing comrade and unofficial cast captain, Gandolfini, makes these stories about playing tough guys all the more tender.\", \"This roundup turns out to be a study in how the memoir form adapts itself to Hollywood subject matter. At first glance, COLORIZATION: One Hundred Years of Black Films in a White World (Knopf, 452 pp., $30) doesn\\u2019t appear to fit the genre comfortably. At second glance, it does in the most meaningful of ways: This is an invaluable national memoir, seen through the ardent research \\u2014 and lived experience \\u2014 of the award-winning Black journalist and movie lover Wil Haygood. (His Washington Post article about the long White House service career of Eugene Allen became the basis for Lee Daniels\\u2019s 2013 historical drama, \\u201cThe Butler.\\u201d)\", \"The white world he has in mind is America, to be exact. And Haygood anchors the opening of his survey in an extended contrast between the life and work of the commandingly influential director D.W. Griffith (whose disquieting 1915 masterpiece, \\u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\\u201d with its vividly racist underpinnings, was screened in Woodrow Wilson\\u2019s White House for an appreciative audience) and that of the contemporaneous Black director Oscar Micheaux. \\u201cTo be Oscar Micheaux in 1920s America was not easy,\\u201d Haygood writes, with the kind of drum-banging prose style that sometimes creeps in when he is at his most fired up. \\u201cHe was running a business and making movies. He was also trying to stay away from the kind of physical assaults that could be meted out to any so-called uppity Negro.\\u201d\", \"But the author\\u2019s unflagging energy also serves as an effective reproach to any who still don\\u2019t feel the frustration of how difficult it has been for so long for Black Americans to see themselves on screen and feel seen in the great American movie industry. Haygood piles up chapters on movie \\u201cMammy\\u201d roles, on \\u201cPorgy and Bess,\\u201d and on Harry Belafonte and Sidney Poitier, who \\u201caltered both Hollywood and America, arriving on the scene like torpedoes, gliding across New York stages, into Las Vegas nightclubs, onto movie-theater marquees, not to mention racing around Mississippi together during the darkest days of the civil rights movement trying to stay alive.\\u201d He considers Dorothy Dandridge and Diana Ross and Pam Grier and Spike Lee and \\u201cRoots\\u201d and \\u201cMoonlight\\u201d and \\u201cGet Out\\u201d and \\u201cBlack Panther\\u201d and, yes, Will Smith, whose \\u201croles were seldom race-specific, and he mostly avoided social dramas. He stood right in the center of the billion-dollar juggernaut of mainstream moviemaking.\\u201d\", \"At times \\u201cColorization\\u201d has the feel of an almanac, or maybe it\\u2019s an encyclopedia, or a time capsule timed right up to the minute. The archivist doesn\\u2019t want to miss a detail or a moment. This is a memoir that demands update and expansion in the years to come.\"]","href_hash":"9a0686ee542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9a0686ee542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}},
