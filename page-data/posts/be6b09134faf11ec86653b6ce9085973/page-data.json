Revivals of two of his shows are currently onstage in New York \\u2014 the gender-swapped version of \\u201cCompany\\u201d on Broadway and the starry production of \\u201cAssassins\\u201d Off Broadway at the Classic Stage Company \\u2014 and Steven Spielberg\\u2019s new film adaptation of \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d will be released on Dec. 10.\", \"But there are a few dozen ways to encounter Sondheim\\u2019s sly wit, melodic acumen and astonishing moral complexity from the comfort of your sofa. Not that he ever lets you get too comfortable. Unlike many of his peers, Sondheim has been served fairly well by film and video. Here are some of the best ways to watch the work of the man who gave us more to see.\", \"Sondheim\\u2019s penetrating study of modern love and even more modern ambivalence is a classic. For a rich encounter with the material, try D.A. Pennebaker\\u2019s 1970 documentary, which details the contentious attempts to record the original cast album at the Church, a Columbia Records studio in Midtown Manhattan. A pleasure throughout and a useful insight into a communal creative process, the movie turns electric when the camera captures Elaine Stritch trying and failing to lay down the devastating track \\u201cThe Ladies Who Lunch.\\u201d\", \"Stream it on the Criterion Channel.\", \"Though dinged at the time for casting Rosalind Russell as the stage monster Mama Rose \\u2014 rather than Ethel Merman, who had created the role \\u2014 Mervyn LeRoy\\u2019s 1962 movie offers a backstage pass to bygone forms of American entertainment: vaudeville and burlesque. Moving nimbly among moods and styles, Sondheim\\u2019s lyrics range from utterly innocent (\\u201cLittle Lamb\\u201d) to tastily racy (\\u201cYou Gotta Get a Gimmick\\u201d), with at least one number, \\u201cRose\\u2019s Turn,\\u201d that suggests the radical revision of the musical that he would later attempt.\", \"Stream it on HBO Max; rent it on Vudu, YouTube, Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video and Google Play.\", \"Enjoy, if you must, Rob Marshall\\u2019s overblown 2014 adaptation of this fairy tale concatenation. But the 1987 version, recorded for PBS\\u2019s \\u201cAmerican Playhouse\\u201d and available on Apple TV, is a superb example of pre-\\u201cHamilton\\u201d performance capture, preserving the indelible performances of Bernadette Peters, Joanna Gleeson and Chip Zien. Children will listen, so watch it with yours. The first act, anyway. Or for a more modern take, try the 2010 version, recorded live in London\\u2019s Regent\\u2019s Park and streamable on Broadway HD, with Hannah Waddingham, of \\u201cTed Lasso,\\u201d as the witch.\", \"Rent the 1987 version from Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\", \"Stream the 2010 version from Broadway HD.\", \"A work of impeccable silliness and absolute froth, the 1966 film version of this meringue-like musical, stitched together from a handful of Plautus comedies, stars Zero Mostel as a scheming servant and Jack Gilford as a gentler one, with the future Phantom Michael Crawford as the love-struck master. It\\u2019s available on several platforms. The songs are flimsy when compared with Sondheim\\u2019s later work, but they delight \\u2014 from the assertiveness of \\u201cComedy Tonight\\u201d to the cheekiness of \\u201cEverybody Ought to Have a Maid\\u201d and the breezy whimsy of \\u201cLovely.\\u201d\", \"Stream it on Pluto TV and Tubi; rent it on YouTube, Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play and Vudu.\", \"An incomparable study of the profit and cost of artistic creation, this 1984 musical, loosely based on the life of Georges Seurat, was captured in 1986 with Mandy Patinkin as the pointillist painter and Peters as his muse, Dot. The filmic shades are muddied \\u2014 a shame for an artist so obsessed with color and light. But Sondheim\\u2019s rigor and originality sound clear in songs like \\u201cFinishing the Hat,\\u201d \\u201cChildren and Art\\u201d and \\u201cMove On.\\u201d\", \"Stream it on Apple TV.\", \"If your preferred form of tribute involves a generous pour, a good cry and an invitation to sing along, lift your voice to this online offering, assembled last year and available in full on YouTube. Hosted by Ra\\u00fal Esparza, its quality is uneven, a consequence of first-wave Zoom theater. But it still moves deftly across and through his six-decade career and offers performances by unmatched interpreters, including Patinkin (\\u201cLesson #8\\u201d from \\u201cSunday in the Park With George\\u201d), Donna Murphy (\\u201cSend in the Clowns\\u201d from \\u201cA Little Night Music\\u201d), Patti LuPone (\\u201cAnyone Can Whistle\\u201d), Bernadette Peters (\\u201cNo One Is Alone\\u201d from \\u201cInto the Woods\\u201d) and the peerless triad of Audra McDonald, Christine Baranski and Meryl Streep (\\u201cThe Ladies Who Lunch\\u201d from \\u201cCompany\\u201d).
