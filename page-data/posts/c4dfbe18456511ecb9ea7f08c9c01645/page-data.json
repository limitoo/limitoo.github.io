It will pay dividends.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-14T16:13:40.000Z","content":"[\"Good morning. We\\u2019ll get to recipes in a moment, delicious ones for a week of eating, but we\\u2019ve got housework to do beforehand, in advance of this coming Thanksgiving feast. Call me bossy if you like, but the labor will pay dividends, I promise.\", \"First, if you\\u2019ll be cooking, today\\u2019s the day to get set on your plan: the recipes you\\u2019ll make; the grocery list you\\u2019ll need to knock out; when in the next two weeks and on the day itself you\\u2019ll make each dish; how you\\u2019ll store and reheat them.\", \"Are you buying a turkey? Fresh or frozen? Whichever, it\\u2019s time to clear out room in the refrigerator to store the thing, either to defrost it or to brine it or both. Take a look at your cabinets and pantry while you\\u2019re at it, and see what dry goods you need and whether you have room to store them.\", \"And, last, this is an excellent day to make pie crust (or vegan pie crust) and stock for the freezer \\u2014 for that last one, roast a few turkey wings in a hot oven for 45 minutes or so, and then follow the recipe as written. (Some will make whole pies for the freezer. One could be Melissa Clark\\u2019s pumpkin pie (above), which she recently baked in our studio kitchen for our YouTube channel; you can watch that video here. And maybe this salted maple pie from Lisa Ludwinski? Absolutely Julia Reed\\u2019s bourbon pecan pie.)\", \"For dinner tonight, after all that work, you\\u2019re likely going to want to take it easy. I like this simple Jerusalem grill over hummus, with pita and a salad of diced Persian cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion and parsley, dressed with salt, olive oil and lemon juice.\", \"Monday: vegan mapo tofu, enough of it so there are leftovers for lunch the next day.\", \"On Tuesday, how about brown-butter salmon with scallions and lemon?\", \"Braised chicken thighs with tomatillos for Wednesday?\", \"I would love to eat what I call amatriciana on the fly on Thursday.\", \"And then we can head into the weekend \\u2014 the last before Thanksgiving! \\u2014 with roast chicken with apricot glaze.\", \"There are many thousands more recipes to cook this week and for Thanksgiving waiting on New York Times Cooking. It\\u2019s true that you need a subscription to access them. Subscriptions support our work! I hope, if you haven\\u2019t already, that you will subscribe today.\", \"You can visit us, as well, on our Instagram page and our YouTube channel. And we are standing by, like docents at your favorite museum, should you find yourself lost in a recipe or confused by our technology. Just ask for help: cookingcare@nytimes.com. Someone will get back to you \\u2014 though if you want to lodge a complaint or deliver a compliment, you can always write to me, too: foodeditor@nytimes.com. I read every letter sent.\", \"Now, it\\u2019s nothing to do with spatchcocking poultry or the best way to peel a chestnut, but I think you\\u2019ll like David Wall\\u2019s letter of recommendation in The New York Times Magazine this week, \\u201cHow I Found Comfort in Volunteer Firefighting.\\u201d\", \"While you\\u2019re at it, check out this report on the confluence of illegal fishing and drug smuggling in the Gulf of Mexico, by John Burnett, in Texas Monthly.\", \"Here\\u2019s \\u201cHarlow,\\u201d a short story by Sheila Armstrong, in The Stinging Fly.\", \"Finally, new music to play us off: Dashboard Confessional, \\u201cHere\\u2019s to Moving On.\\u201d Teen vibes! Listen to that, and I\\u2019ll be back on Monday.\"]","href_hash":"c4dfbe18456511ecb9ea7f08c9c01645"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c4dfbe18456511ecb9ea7f08c9c01645"}},
