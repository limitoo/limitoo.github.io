Prosecutors suspect that the jailed Murdaugh is hiding millions of dollars that could be shifted into different accounts. The theory was proposed by attorney Mark Tinsley, representing the family of a young woman killed in a crash involving Murdaugh's boat. Due to Hall's decision, Murdaugh's assets will be reviewed and cataloged to determine if he can get ahold of the money while in jail.\", \"\\\"They have refused from day one to give me any information,\\\" said Tinsley in a statement.\", \"Attorney John Tiller, representing Murdaugh in the case, argues that his client has yet to be charged in any civil suits and thus cannot have his finances assessed. He also says that the decision to freeze his client's assets could \\\"open the door for similar [rulings] to happen in countless other cases,\\\" according to the Associated Press.\", \"Murdaugh is currently held in the Richland County Jail without bond. He is being charged with stealing nearly $3 million in insurance payments after the falling death of his housekeeper in 2018. He is also being accused of planning his death for his surviving son, Buster, to receive a $10 million life insurance payment.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1924554/alex-murdaugh-trial.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Alex Murdaugh awaits the beginning of his bond hearing in the Richland Judicial Center in Columbia, S.C., Tuesday, Oct. 19, 2021.

Those attorneys expect judges in their cases to allow them to use the independent monitors.\", \"The same day that Murdaugh was arrested, the father signed a power of attorney for all his affairs over to his son, according to court records.\"]","href_hash":"9fa203043bfb11eca562000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9fa203043bfb11eca562000017025a03"}},
