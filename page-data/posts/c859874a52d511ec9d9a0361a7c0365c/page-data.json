La Ni\\u00f1a has disappointed farmers before \\u2014 and will do so again \\u2014 due to variability of where and how much rain falls. This variability has led to increased mistrust in seasonal forecasts.\", \"Even though Australia has just had its wettest November in more than two decades, some farmers are still waiting.\", \"Last year's La Ni\\u00f1a delivered good rainfall in some areas \\u2014 while leaving others drier than they would have been under an El Ni\\u00f1o, with many areas in southern Queensland missing out. In La Ni\\u00f1a years, the cattle farming town of Roma receives an average of 247mm from November to the end of January. Last year they only got half that.\", \"This year's La Ni\\u00f1a has already delivered rain to many areas left dry last year. Roma, for example, has received more than 200mm in November 2021 alone. These large rainfall events and seasons are required after ongoing drought to recharge the moisture in the soil.\", \"But continued rain will be less welcome in newly waterlogged areas along the Queensland and NSW border and the Northern Rivers region, given it may lead to further flooding.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What does La Nina mean for farmers?</div>\", \"Seasonal forecasts\\u00a0give a greater than 60 per cent chance of rainfall above the median for much of eastern Australia from now to the end of March.\", \"If this summer of rain eventuates, it will be welcome news for many farmers in eastern Australia who have had below-median rainfall for three or more years.\", \"Farmers usually welcome La Ni\\u00f1a with open arms, given plentiful rainfall can boost production and profits.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/02d851a07283610ce72d84423c8d4cdf\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The east is bracing for a wet summer.(Supplied:\\u00a0Bureau of Meteorology)</div>\", \"Still, a boon for one industry can be a burden for another, with heavy or prolonged rainfall able to damage fruit and delicate crops as well as delaying harvests or making them more challenging. Flooding can wash away entire fields and damage roads and other infrastructure.\", \"For the sugar industry, increased rainfall associated with La Ni\\u00f1a can mean sugarcane has to be harvested at lower sugar content levels, or be delayed in harvesting. The cane can be knocked over by heavy rain, which makes harvesting difficult and reduces yield, all of which reduce profitability.\", \"For the grains industry, the bumper grain crop predicted for 2021 has\\u00a0already been downgraded\\u00a0in areas like New South Wales due to flooding, with losses expected to be in the billions.\", \"By contrast, the beef industry in Queensland relies on grass, so a La Ni\\u00f1a summer with above average rain can increase pasture growth and regeneration as well as cattle weight gain and market prices.\", \"This double-edged sword \\u2014 too much rain or not enough \\u2014 is nothing new to Australian farmers.\", \"Understanding how La Ni\\u00f1a and other ENSO (El Ni\\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation) events impact different regions and industries is critical to take advantage of good years, minimise losses in poor years, and make sound decisions based on the best possible information.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e0884d48b0639d22f9eb3d8c6f7f61e6\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Hundreds of people evacuate Inglewood, west of Brisbane</div>\", \"What does that look like? In La Ni\\u00f1a years, cattle farmers may decide to move their cattle out of flood prone regions or rest a paddock to allow it to regenerate with the extra rain, which will provide more grass in the following season.\", \"For grain farmers, La Ni\\u00f1a means keeping a close eye on both three-month seasonal climate forecasts and the daily weather forecasts to decide if it's worth the risk to plant a big crop and if they are likely to be able to harvest it before any big rainfall events occur.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Can we predict La Ni\\u00f1a rainfall?</div>\", \"La Ni\\u00f1a events usually bring average to above average rain to much of Australia's east. Unfortunately, no two La Ni\\u00f1as occur in the same way.\", \"Because of this variability, it is important for farmers to understand how La Ni\\u00f1a events impact their area so that they can plan for likely conditions.\", \"Australia's east coast climate is heavily influenced by the El Ni\\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a naturally occurring phenomenon centred in the tropical Pacific that consists of three separate phases: La Ni\\u00f1a, El Ni\\u00f1o, and a neutral or inactive phase.\", \"La Ni\\u00f1a years occur around 25 per cent of the time, with El Ni\\u00f1o years also at 25 per cent, and neutral years making up 50 per cent. ENSO is not fully predictable, and moves irregularly between these phases. While it is unusual to have back-to-back La Ni\\u00f1as it is not unprecedented.\", \"During these La Ni\\u00f1a events, surface water in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific cools and the ocean to the north of Australia tends to warm.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/1c36b8107edf64c9d345af6accb1ea50\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Eastern Australia to brace for wild weather as BOM declares La Nina event</div>\", \"Changes in the ocean drive changes in the atmosphere over the Pacific. Like a rock thrown in a pond, however, this Pacific phenomenon ripples outwards, causing atmospheric changes in places like Australia and Chile.\", \"In Australia, La Ni\\u00f1a tends to bring more rain and lower temperatures across much of the country, while we see increases in heavy rain,\\u00a0flooding, and severe tropical cyclones\\u00a0making landfall.\", \"What does the future hold? While most La Ni\\u00f1a events are\\u00a0projected to produce less rainfall\\u00a0in many regions, projections suggest the wettest La Ni\\u00f1a years will tend to be just as wet or wetter that they were in the past.\", \"Australia's farmers will continue to face the challenges of floods and droughts brought by La Ni\\u00f1a and El Ni\\u00f1o, but as farmers learn more about these events and how they impact their area and industry, they can become more resilient.\", \"Chelsea Jarvis is a research fellow at the University of Southern Queensland\\u00a0and Professor Scott B.
