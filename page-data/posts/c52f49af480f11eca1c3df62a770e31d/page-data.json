During two weeks of testimony, jurors saw the higher-quality version of the video.\", \"Judge Bruce Schroeder said the trial would continue but suggested that he could rule on the request for a mistrial at any time, including after a verdict.\", \"\\u201cIt has to be addressed if there is a guilty verdict on any degree on that count,\\u201d Judge Schroeder said of the motion.\", \"The jurors \\u2014 seven women and five men \\u2014 offered a few glimpses into how their deliberations, which started on Tuesday morning, were proceeding.\", \"At points during their deliberations, jurors asked the judge for permission to watch videos that had been played during the trial, including footage of all three shootings from the night in question. By midafternoon, the courtroom was emptied for close to an hour so the jury could enter and watch videos without the judge, lawyers, journalists and the public present.\", \"Noise from demonstrators could be heard through the windows of the ornate courtroom, on the third floor of the Kenosha County Courthouse. Throughout the day, several dozen protesters lingered on the courthouse steps, arguing, occasionally shouting obscenities and chanting, \\u201cNo mistrial, no mistrial.\\u201d\", \"At least two people were detained after a fight on Wednesday afternoon, and earlier in the day, one man who was carrying an AR-15-style rifle outside the courthouse was asked by a sheriff\\u2019s deputy to put it away, which he did.\", \"Judge Schroeder indicated that he was concerned that prosecutors had not turned over the correct version of the video to the defense team before the trial, but he did not immediately rule on the defense\\u2019s motion for a mistrial.\", \"James Kraus, an assistant district attorney, said one of Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s previous lawyers had been in possession of the high-quality video, and he argued that the issue was not significant enough to merit a mistrial.\", \"An accidental \\u201ctechnical incident,\\u201d he said, \\u201cshould not result in a mistrial.\\u201d\", \"Corey Chirafisi, one of Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s lawyers, said that a prosecutor\\u2019s job was about \\u201cfairness and being a truth seeker\\u201d and that the Kenosha County prosecutors had violated those principles. He also said he was willing to accept a mistrial \\u201cwithout prejudice,\\u201d meaning that prosecutors could try the case again.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not debatable that it\\u2019s not fair what happened,\\u201d Mr. Chirafisi said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re talking about a potential life sentence here.\\u201d\", \"Last week, Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s lawyers made a motion for a mistrial over a different issue.\", \"In that motion, they argued that another prosecutor, Thomas Binger, had inappropriately questioned Mr. Rittenhouse before the jury about why he had not spoken about the shootings in their aftermath. The defense lawyers said that the comments had infringed on Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s right to remain silent, and that Mr. Binger had also begun to mention a piece of evidence the judge had suggested should not be brought up at trial.\", \"Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s lawyers argued at that time that the judge should declare a mistrial with prejudice, which would amount to a permanent dismissal of the charges. The judge has yet to rule on either motion for a mistrial.\", \"One reason a judge might wait until after a verdict to rule on mistrial motions, some legal experts said, would be so that the case reaches a clear outcome. If the jury acquits, the mistrial motions would become moot. If the jury convicts and then the judge grants a mistrial and voids the verdict, the prosecution could have the opportunity to appeal the finding.\"]","href_hash":"c52f49af480f11eca1c3df62a770e31d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c52f49af480f11eca1c3df62a770e31d"}},
