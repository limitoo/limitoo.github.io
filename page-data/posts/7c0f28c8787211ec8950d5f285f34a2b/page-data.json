However, the virus can spread from people to animals during close contact. The CDC says more studies must be done in order to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19, but people with COVID-19 should avoid contact with animals.\", \"Officials in Hong Kong are not taking the slim chance of transmission with hamsters. \\\"We cannot exclude the possibility that the shopkeeper was in fact actually infected from the hamsters,\\\" said Edwin Tsui, a controller at the Centre for Health Protection, according to the AP.\", \"Officials said hamster owners should not take their pets out and should avoid kissing their pets, as well as practice good hygiene.\\u00a0\", \"In 2020, a\\u00a0tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive\\u00a0for COVID-19.
