Trump, who used his Twitter feed to threaten his enemies and to keep his allies in line. Twitter barred Mr. Trump shortly after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\", \"Mr. Dorsey, 45, who is also the chief executive of the payments company Square, was fired from the top job at Twitter in 2008 but returned in 2015. His departure represents the second recent significant shake up at a major social media company. Last month, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta. The change was accompanied by a new corporate logo and an emphasis on a virtual world called the metaverse, but Mark Zuckerberg, its high-profile chief executive, will still run the company.\", \"The departure of Mr. Dorsey is a critical changing of the guard for the company. Mr. Dorsey\\u2019s name has been as closely associated with Twitter as Mr. Zuckerberg\\u2019s has been with Facebook, although Twitter is nowhere near as large. Mr. Dorsey has become a celebrity outside of Silicon Valley, parodied on \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d and needled on his own social media platform for his long facial hair and his personal wellness pursuits.\", \"\\u201cIf you stand back and you think about who\\u2019s had a big influence on social media over the past decade, the name Jack Dorsey is always going to come up,\\u201d said Tim Hubbard, an assistant professor of management at the University of Notre Dame\\u2019s Mendoza College of Business.\", \"Like Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Dorsey has been called to Washington to testify about his company\\u2019s content moderation and censorship complaints. But the decision to remove Mr. Trump\\u2019s account was made by one of Mr. Dorsey\\u2019s lieutenants, a contrast with Mr. Zuckerberg\\u2019s direct involvement in high-profile moderation decisions. Mr. Dorsey was working on a private island in French Polynesia when it happened \\u2014 adding to concern that he was not fully engaged with his company.\", \"Mr. Dorsey said in an email to Twitter employees, which he also posted publicly, that he wanted Twitter to stop being a founder-led company, which could be a weakness over time.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders,\\u201d Mr. Dorsey wrote, adding: \\u201cI believe it\\u2019s critical a company can stand on its own, free of its founder\\u2019s influence or direction.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThere aren\\u2019t many companies that get to this level. And there aren\\u2019t many founders that choose their company over their own ego,\\u201d Mr. Dorsey said.\", \"A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the announcement. Mr. Dorsey\\u2019s plans were first reported by CNBC.\", \"Mr. Dorsey\\u2019s leadership and focus had been questioned by employees and investors for some time. His departure comes a year and a half after he survived an attempted ouster from the activist investor Elliott Management.\", \"Chief among Elliott\\u2019s concerns was that Mr. Dorsey\\u2019s attention was divided between the two companies he led. The firm believed that Twitter had fallen behind social media rivals in increasing its stock price and adding innovative new products.\", \"Some employees rallied around Mr. Dorsey during the attempt to force him out, using the hashtag #WeBackJack as a rallying cry.\", \"In March 2020, Elliott Management struck a deal with Silver Lake, one of Silicon Valley\\u2019s biggest investors in technology companies, that allowed Mr. Dorsey to remain at Twitter. The deal also gave Jesse Cohn, the Elliott executive who oversaw the Twitter campaign, a seat on Twitter\\u2019s board. Mr. Cohn joined a five-member committee that led a review of Twitter\\u2019s C.E.O. succession planning.\", \"Last November, that committee completed its review, saying that it had \\u201cupdated the C.E.O. succession plan in line with best practices,\\u201d according to a regulatory filing, laying a path for the transition. Twitter\\u2019s stock began to climb, and in February, Mr. Dorsey announced an ambitious plan to double Twitter\\u2019s revenue by the end of 2023. The company also sped up its product pace, releasing new features like audio chat, newsletters and tipping.\", \"Mr. Cohn stepped down from Twitter\\u2019s board in June.\", \"\\u201cOur collaboration with Jack and the company for the past two years has been productive and effective,\\u201d Mr. Cohn and Marc Steinberg, a senior portfolio manager at Elliott, said in a joint statement. They also praised Mr. Agrawal and Bret Taylor, the president of Salesforce and Twitter\\u2019s incoming board chairman, saying: \\u201cWe are confident that they are the right leaders for Twitter at this pivotal moment for the company.\\u201d\", \"But some of Twitter\\u2019s stock market gains have slipped away in recent months, with shares now worth roughly the same as they were a year ago. Twitter said its revenue grew 37 percent in the third quarter from a year prior, to $1.28 billion, but it lost $537 million.\", \"Some legislators have demanded that Twitter do more to address misinformation and hate speech on the platform, while others have accused Mr. Dorsey of censorship and argued that Twitter should allow more content to remain online.\", \"The moderation issues have been a persistent irritation for Mr. Dorsey. He had envisioned Twitter as a platform for free speech and bristled at the idea of removing content, especially from world leaders and other newsworthy figures.\", \"Mr. Trump\\u2019s incendiary tweets tested Mr. Dorsey\\u2019s stance. Twitter at first compromised by labeling some of Mr. Trump\\u2019s tweets as misinformation before finally removing his account.\", \"Mr. Dorsey, who will remain on Twitter\\u2019s board until its next election in 2022, stressed that he had made the decision to leave and had not been forced to go. He had recently discussed his desire to leave Twitter and to focus on projects in cryptocurrency and philanthropy, said a person familiar with his thinking who was not authorized to speak publicly.\", \"In recent years, Mr. Dorsey has become increasingly interested in cryptocurrencies and the principle of technology decentralization. He said in 2019 that Twitter would help to build a decentralized form of social media that would allow users to set their own algorithms for promoting content and moderate their own communities rather than relying on tech companies to make those decisions.\", \"Mr. Dorsey tapped Mr. Agrawal to oversee Twitter\\u2019s contributions to the project, known as Bluesky, which is funded by Twitter but operates independently. In August, Twitter hired Jay Graber, a cryptocurrency developer and the founder of a social events start-up, to lead Bluesky.\", \"Mr. Agrawal, 37, is a low-profile figure who started his career at Twitter over a decade ago as an engineer. He worked his way up through the company and was made its chief technology officer in 2017.\", \"\\u201cParag has been behind every critical decision that helped turn this company around,\\u201d Mr. Dorsey said in his email. \\u201cMy trust in him as our C.E.O. is bone-deep.\\u201d\", \"The majority of Mr. Dorsey\\u2019s wealth comes from Square, which he co-founded in 2009 during his last departure from Twitter. Last year, Mr. Dorsey announced that he would donate $1 billion, or nearly a third of his total wealth at the time, to relief programs related to the coronavirus and other philanthropic endeavors. Mr. Dorsey also has given $15 million to guaranteed-income projects, which allow cities to provide financial support to residents in need. Forbes estimates Mr. Dorsey\\u2019s net worth at over $11 billion.\", \"Twitter\\u2019s stock jumped 5 percent on the news of Mr. Dorsey\\u2019s departure before a halt in trading. It closed down about 2.7 percent.\", \"On Sunday night, perhaps foreshadowing the news to come, Mr. Dorsey tweeted, \\u201cI love Twitter.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9854488c521711ec9bf99f12da131946"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9854488c521711ec9bf99f12da131946"}},
