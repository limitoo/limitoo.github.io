Then, finally, we stopped the domestic food offer and we did that back on 1 December, because we could see in all likelihood we'd be dealing with Omicron and frankly it's taken a bit longer to get here than what I thought, but now it's here I'm glad we took those actions.\\\"\", \"He said New Zealand was still the safest airline to travel with in the world.\", \"Foran said the crew member who caught Omicron was wearing an N95 mask and had been following all the safety protocols. Training had been supplied to fit the mask properly, he added.\", \"The attendant worked on the flight of a family returning to Nelson after attending a wedding in Auckland.\", \"The case had been picked up in routine testing and the person is in good spirits, Foran said..\", \"The airline was preparing for the impact Omicron would have on its customers and employees.\", \"The national carrier is free to operate in the red setting and there are no regional borders in place as there were during the recent Delta outbreak.\", \"But the airline boss was now in discussions with government over how the airline's domestic and international flights could continue to operate.\", \"The company now faces issues of standing down staff over the coming period. Foran expected to have clarification by Wednesday on how it could deal with the matter.\", \"\\\"We've seen this play out internationally,\\\" he said. \\\"Just last Friday I had the opportunity to have a chat with the chief executive of Scandinavian Airlines. He was telling me what it was like dealing with Omicron and they were seeing 25 percent absenteeism.\", \"\\\"This is very difficult. I think we're going to see quite a few Air New Zealanders unfortunately, despite all the protocols and procedures that we have in place, are going to end up catching Omicron.\", \"\\\"We're going to need some help to deal with running the airline and on how critical workers are going to be handled in terms of stand-down time and testing...\\\"\", \"\\\"It won't just be airlines, it will be supermarkets, and hospitals and other transport providers, and it's going to be important that we get those things in place. Not just to move customers, but cargo as well. It's critical that we continue to keep domestic and international lines open.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"5c65e3d87cad11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5c65e3d87cad11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
