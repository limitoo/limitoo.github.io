Kevin Stitt to commute the death sentence of Julius Jones. The Board recommended in a 3-1 vote Monday that the governor alter Jones' sentence to life in prison with the possibility of parole, according to the Associated Press.\", \"Members of the panel expressed doubts over the evidence used to prosecute Jones, 41, in the 1999 death of businessman Paul Howell. Jones continues to maintain his innocence, alleging he was framed by a former co-defendant through planted evidence, such as a bandanna and the gun used to kill Howell.\", \"The decision by the Pardon and Parole Board comes after Jones' clemency hearing on Monday. The hearing ran for three hours, with the Board's final decision being sent to Stitt. The governor now has to determine whether to carry out Jones' scheduled execution on Nov. 18 or order clemency.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1893607/julius-jones.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board recommended the governor grant clemency to Julius Jones on Monday, Nov. 1.
