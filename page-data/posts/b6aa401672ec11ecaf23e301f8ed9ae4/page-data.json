I know where I stand. I will not yield. I will not flinch. I will defend your right to vote and our democracy against all enemies foreign and domestic. And so, the question is where will the institution of United States Senate stand?\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Traveling with Mr. Biden to Georgia is Senator Raphael Warnock and members of the state's congressional delegation, as well as former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.\", \"The speech from the president is viewed by the White House as an extension of his condemnations of the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol during remarks marking its one-year anniversary. The president used his fiery speech\\u00a0last week to pledge he would \\\"allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy.\\\"\", \"Mr. Biden's visit and address in Atlanta is also aimed at the Senate, where Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he will soon bring the voting rights legislation to the floor despite expected unanimous opposition by Senate Republicans.\", \"If Republicans filibuster the bills as expected, denying Democrats the 60 votes they need to advance legislation in the 50-50 Senate, Schumer has pledged to bring forward changes to the Senate rules that would lower the threshold for the measures to advance in the upper chamber with a simple majority.\", \"\\\"If Republicans refuse to join us in a bipartisan spirit \\u2014 if they continue to hijack the rules of the Senate to turn this chamber into a deep freezer \\u2014 we are going to consider the appropriate steps necessary to restore the Senate, so we can pass these proposals and send them to the president's desk,\\\" Schumer said on the Senate floor Monday.\", \"But Schumer still faces an uphill battle to changing Senate rules that would make it easier for voting rights legislation to clear. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, both moderate Democrats, generally oppose changing the chamber's rules.\", \"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, accused Schumer of mounting \\\"an attempt to attack the core identity of the Senate.\\\"\", \"McConnell also accused Democratic leaders of \\\"trying to use a big lie to bully and berate their own members into breaking their word, breaking the rules, and breaking the Senate.\\\"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"b6aa401672ec11ecaf23e301f8ed9ae4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b6aa401672ec11ecaf23e301f8ed9ae4"}},
