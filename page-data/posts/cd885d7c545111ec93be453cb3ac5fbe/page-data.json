The president\\u2019s comments highlight that scientists still cannot say with certainty where the variant originated.\", \"Last week, after Botswana and South Africa became the first countries to identify the variant, many Western nations, including the United States, closed their borders to travelers from southern Africa. It was sometimes called the \\u201cBotswana variant,\\u201d before the World Health Organization last Friday labeled it a \\u201cvariant of concern\\u201d and named it Omicron.\", \"Mr. Masisi described the travel bans as \\u201cirresponsible,\\u201d saying that those nations were experiencing far worse coronavirus outbreaks than Botswana.

They tested positive for the coronavirus on Nov. 11, and genetic sequencing confirmed on Nov. 24 that they were carrying the variant. \", \"By then, officials have said, the diplomats had returned to their home countries.\"]","href_hash":"cd885d7c545111ec93be453cb3ac5fbe"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cd885d7c545111ec93be453cb3ac5fbe"}},
