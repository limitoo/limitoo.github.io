The bloc voiced its concern after Washington demanded an explanation from Moscow about the troop movements, and amid mounting tension between the U.S. and Europe in the west, and Russia and its small ally Belarus in the east.\", \"\\\"We continue to watch the situation and the information we gathered so far is rather worrying,\\\" EU foreign affairs spokesman Peter Stano told journalists. He said the 27-nation bloc was monitoring the situation with partners including the United States and Britain and \\\"we are open to look at further steps as necessary.\\\"\", \" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday warned Russia against making another \\\"serious mistake\\\" on Ukraine, as Washington sought clarity about Russian troop movements near the border.\", \"Welcoming Ukraine's foreign minister to Washington, Blinken said the U.S. was \\\"concerned with reports of the unusual Russian activity near Ukraine.\\\"\", \"\\\"We don't have clarity into Moscow's intentions, but we do know its playbook,\\\" Blinken told a joint news conference. \\\"Our concern is that Russia may make the serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked.\\\"\", \"Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Russian movements were \\\"unusual in its size and scope,\\\" and added that it was \\\"not exactly clear what the Russian intentions are.\\\"\", \" Ukraine has been ensnared in a deadly war with Moscow-backed separatists in its east since 2014 when Russia seized the Crimean peninsula.\", \"EU chief Ursula von der Leyen discussed the situation around Ukraine with U.S. President Joe Biden during a visit to Washington this week.\", \" \\\"The EU and the U.S. fully support the territorial integrity of Ukraine,\\\" von der Leyen tweeted after the meeting. \\\"We are fully behind them in their efforts to modernize their economy and build up resilience.\\\"\", \" An official at U.S.-led NATO said the alliance was \\\"vigilant and routinely monitors Russian force movements.
