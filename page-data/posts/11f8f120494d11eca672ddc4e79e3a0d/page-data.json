The screwball absurdity of the spot \\u2014 and an accompanying dance tutorial, in which the Lad paid tribute to his late \\u201cmummy\\u201d \\u2014 seemed to scratch a specific itch. Both videos became early viral hits online.\", \"Fourteen years and many iterations of social media culture later, the podcaster and comedian Justin McElroy uploaded a clip of the \\u201cberries and cream\\u201d song and dance to TikTok, where mining 2000s nostalgia had become a trope.\", \"\\u201cYou don\\u2019t want to get too hyperbolic about a 30-second commercial, but Jack as the Little Lad is both hysterical and weirdly subversive,\\u201d McElroy said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s one of those things you pull up on YouTube every now and then just to see if it\\u2019s as strange as you remember it.\\u201d In his January TikTok post, he entreated: \\u201cPlease make great art with this.\\u201d\", \"TikTok answered the call. Thousands of young users \\u2014 many discovering the character for the first time \\u2014 began uploading their own Little Lad tributes and creating \\u201cberries and cream\\u201d song mash-ups.\", \"Which brings us back to the Lad himself. Since filming the Berries and Cream commercial, Ferver, who uses they/them pronouns, has become a professor at Bard College and built a body of psychological dance-theater works that are often darkly funny. Though well regarded on the New York arts scene, Ferver was relatively unknown outside of it \\u2014 until the Starburst character\\u2019s TikTok renaissance.\", \"In September, Ferver, now 42, set up @thereallittlelad TikTok account and began creating short monologues and dances in character. His inspired, slightly unhinged posts delighted \\u201cberries and cream\\u201d TikTok. Within a month, the Little Lad had more than 2 million followers. Ferver also started a YouTube channel, which allowed the Lad more space to sing songs about Mummy, explore ASMR and share hair care tips. Eventually, Starburst caught on to the trend, hiring Ferver for a TikTok ad campaign. (The brand has teased bringing back the Berries and Cream flavor.)\", \"The Little Lad\\u2019s viral wave may already have crested. But Ferver, now indelibly associated with the character, sees it as of a piece with their other performance art. Recently, they spoke about the Little Lad\\u2019s wild ride. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"You weren\\u2019t a TikTok person before all of this, right?\", \"Not at all. I did one TikTok post as Jack Ferver for a commission in 2020. And then I thought, I don\\u2019t know what to do with this app. I\\u2019m old!\", \"How did you hear about the \\u201cberries and cream\\u201d trend on TikTok?\", \"This summer, all of my friends kept sending me TikToks of people doing Little Lad content. It felt very \\u201cTwin Peaks\\u201d to me. Like, \\u201cThe Little Lad: The Return.\\u201d\", \"It was [the dancer and costume designer] Reid Bartelme, my best friend and former podcast co-host, who was like, \\u201cYou have to do something.\\u201d You know, in his classic Sagittarius push-you-out-the-door way. So I thought, OK, I\\u2019ll go to Wigs and Plus and get a wig and do this TikTok and then see how it goes. I certainly didn\\u2019t anticipate getting two million followers in a month.\", \"Rewatching the 2007 ad now, it feels very much like a Jack Ferver production. How much of the original Little Lad came from you?\", \"There was a script, and it was collaborative. But a lot was me. For my audition, I probably did that song and dance 16 different ways. I remember thinking, this should be a simple child\\u2019s dance, something that anyone could do, like ring-around-a-rosy.\", \"A dance that anyone could do \\u2014 you were making a TikTok dance. In 2007.\", \"Which is so bizarre, right? It does feel like this precursor to the TikTok dances \\u2014 even in that it had this viral component of \\u201chow to do it,\\u201d which is also very TikTok.\", \"What were your feelings about the ad\\u2019s initial success?\", \"Mostly I just felt lucky. I wanted to make my own work, and one ad that took a couple of days to film would allow me to sustain myself long enough to get one of my vanguard performance pieces forward.\", \"Once you started posting TikToks as the Little Lad, you built out the character very quickly.\", \"I mean, I\\u2019ve made 16 full-length works. I\\u2019ve been in all these theater and TV and film productions. I\\u2019m a writer who grew up as a performer.\", \"And you had the strangeness of the commercial to build on.\", \"Something that feels exciting to me about the Little Lad on TikTok, and feels really true to the original ad, is that you get mystery and you get humor, and to do both at the same time is hard.\", \"Also, as I caught on to how TikTok works, I let that inform what the Little Lad was doing. TikTok has this community component to it that these other platforms don\\u2019t. What I found interesting was writing back to people who were commenting, and really getting into that zone of performing the Little Lad. It\\u2019s another performance art piece.\", \"What\\u2019s involved in your Little Lad transformation?\", \"The hair and makeup is a big part of it. It\\u2019s creating a lot of container, a lot of structure, and then free-associating inside of that. None of these TikToks are premeditated. The YouTube videos are not scripted. And part of that is because I\\u2019m curious about what could happen with it. Is this something that could become a show? Maybe.\", \"I hope that wasn\\u2019t too esoteric an answer. The brass tacks of it are that I\\u2019ve put together some looks, and my best girlfriend Parker [Posey, the actor] has a farmhouse upstate, where I\\u2019ll shoot a lot of things.\", \"I keep wondering if we\\u2019ll see more of Jack\\u2019s world in the Little Lad\\u2019s posts.\", \"That\\u2019s something I\\u2019ve been thinking about: Do I, Jack Ferver, bring my own life into this whole thing? I\\u2019d been reticent even to do an interview about this, because I wanted to keep the Little Lad as mysterious as possible. There was all this debate about if the Little Lad was actually me, and I loved reading those posts. I felt like I was in a TikTok Elena Ferrante moment.\", \"But I guess enough people know it\\u2019s me at this point. And the kindness of the people who respond to the Little Lad really ties it into everything I make as Jack Ferver, too. The whole reason I make work is that I want to help people experience more kindness and feel less alone.\", \"The Little Lad community is an unusually kind corner of the internet.\", \"So kind!\", \"One way we see that is commenters gently reminding each other that you, Jack Ferver, use they/them pronouns.\", \"I\\u2019ve felt very bolstered from what I\\u2019ve seen from TikTok in terms of breaking away from categorical thinking \\u2014 with gender, with everything.\", \"And by the way, Jack Ferver is they/them, but the Little Lad has said they use all pronouns. I, feeling like the parent of the Little Lad here, am interested in making sure the Little Lad includes everybody, that they invite everyone to play.\", \"You\\u2019ve had an extensive performance career, and yet the Little Lad is probably going to be the way most of the world knows you. How does that feel?\", \"This whole thing has been so surprising! What a gift to be surprised at this point in my life. If I heard someone else tell this story \\u2014 \\u201cThere was this performance artist, and they did this commercial that had this resurgence, and they did these TikToks\\u201d \\u2014 I\\u2019d be like, Sounds bizarre! Sounds interesting! Tell me more!\"]","href_hash":"11f8f120494d11eca672ddc4e79e3a0d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"11f8f120494d11eca672ddc4e79e3a0d"}},
