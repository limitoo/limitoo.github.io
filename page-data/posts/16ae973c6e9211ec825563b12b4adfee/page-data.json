This missile, which shares a few features in common with the Hwasong-8, is another.\\\"\", \"After this week's launch was detected on Wednesday, the US State Department said it violated multiple UN Security Council Resolutions and poses a threat to North Korea's neighbours and the international community. The department did not immediately respond to requests for comment on North Korea's report it had tested a hypersonic weapon.\", \"North Korea's last missile launch was in October, when it says it fired a new short-range missile from a submarine.\", \"That ballistic missile submarine has returned to the secure boat basin at the Sinpho South Shipyard, following a brief period of hull maintenance after that test, 38 North, a Washington-based programme that monitors North Korea, reported on Thursday.\", \"Talks aimed at persuading North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile arsenal have been stalled since a series of summits between leader Kim Jong Un and then-US President Donald Trump broke down with no agreement.\", \"US President Joe Biden's administration has said it is open to talking to North Korea, but Pyongyang has said American overtures are empty rhetoric without more substantive changes to \\\"hostile policies\\\" such as military drills and sanctions.\", \"The latest test came just hours before South Korean President Moon Jae-in attended a groundbreaking ceremony for a rail line he hopes will eventually connect the divided Korean peninsula, casting doubts over his hopes for an eleventh-hour diplomatic breakthrough with North Korea before his five-year term ends in May.\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"16ae973c6e9211ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"16ae973c6e9211ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
