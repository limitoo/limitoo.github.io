The Supreme Court held that state officials could be sued in federal court to prevent them from trying to enforce unconstitutional laws.\", \"However, the court\\u2019s majority decision, written by Justice Rufus W. Peckham, said that this mechanism could not be used to \\u201crestrain the state court from acting in any case brought before it either of a civil or criminal nature.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cAn injunction by a federal court against a state court would violate the whole scheme of this government, and it does not follow that, because an individual may be enjoined from doing certain things, a court may be similarly enjoined.\\u201d\", \"The twist raised by the Texas anti-abortion case is that state officials are forbidden to enforce the law, which conflicts with the Supreme Court\\u2019s current abortion rights rulings. Instead, the law is enforced by private citizens\\u2019 filing lawsuits against abortion providers, or against people who assist them or women seeking abortions.\", \"The plaintiffs \\u2014 the Justice Department and abortion providers in Texas \\u2014 have sought to address that twist by seeking an injunction barring state courts from hearing such cases.\"]","href_hash":"8604ba963b3211ecb24b000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8604ba963b3211ecb24b000017025a03"}},
