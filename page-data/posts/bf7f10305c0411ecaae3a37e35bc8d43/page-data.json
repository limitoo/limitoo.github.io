President Biden has had both big accomplishments and big setbacks in his first year, as is typical. In Congress, members are haggling over bills and passing some of them. At the Supreme Court, justices are hearing cases. Daily media coverage tends to reflect this apparent sense of political normalcy.\", \"But American politics today is not really normal. It may instead be in the midst of a radical shift away from the democratic rules and traditions that have guided the country for a very long time.\", \"An anti-democratic movement, inspired by Donald Trump but much larger than him, is making significant progress, as my colleague Charles Homans has reported. In the states that decide modern presidential elections, this movement has already changed some laws and ousted election officials, with the aim of overturning future results. It has justified the changes with blatantly false statements claiming that Biden did not really win the 2020 election.\", \"The movement has encountered surprisingly little opposition. Most leading Republican politicians have either looked the other way or supported the anti-democratic movement. In the House, Republicans ousted Liz Cheney from a leadership position because she called out Trump\\u2019s lies.\", \"The pushback within the Republican Party has been so weak that about 60 percent of Republican adults now tell pollsters that they believe the 2020 election was stolen \\u2014 a view that\\u2019s simply wrong.\", \"Most Democratic officials, for their part, have been focused on issues other than election security, like Covid-19 and the economy. It\\u2019s true that congressional Democrats have tried to pass a new voting rights bill, only to be stymied by Republican opposition and the filibuster. But these Democratic efforts have been sprawling and unfocused. They have included proposals \\u2014 on voter-ID rules and mail-in ballots, for example \\u2014 that are almost certainly less important than a federal law to block the overturning of elections, as The Times\\u2019s Nate Cohn has explained.\", \"All of which has created a remarkable possibility: In the 2024 presidential election, Republican officials in at least one state may overturn a legitimate election result, citing fraud that does not exist, and award the state\\u2019s electoral votes to the Republican nominee. Trump tried to use this tactic in 2020, but local officials rebuffed him.\", \"Since then, his supporters have launched a campaign \\u2014 with the Orwellian name \\u201cStop the Steal\\u201d \\u2014 to ensure success next time. Steve Bannon has played a central role, using his podcast to encourage Trump supporters to take over positions in election administration, ProPublica has explained.\", \"\\u201cThis is a five-alarm fire,\\u201d Jocelyn Benson, the Democratic secretary of state in Michigan, who presided over the 2020 vote count there, told The Times. \\u201cIf people in general, leaders and citizens, aren\\u2019t taking this as the most important issue of our time and acting accordingly, then we may not be able to ensure democracy prevails again in \\u201924.\\u201d\", \"Barton Gellman, who wrote a recent Atlantic magazine article about the movement, told Terry Gross of NPR last week, \\u201cThis is, I believe, a democratic emergency, and that without very strong and systematic pushback from protectors of democracy, we\\u2019re going to lose something that we can\\u2019t afford to lose about the way we run elections.\\u201d\", \"Theda Skocpol, a Harvard political scientist, notes that the movement is bigger than Trump. \\u201cI think things have now moved to the point that many Republican Party officials and elected officeholders are self-starters,\\u201d she told Thomas Edsall of Times Opinion.\", \"The main battlegrounds are swing states where Republicans control the state legislature, like Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\", \"Republicans control these legislatures because of both gerrymandered districts and Democratic weakness outside of major metro areas. (One way Democrats can push back against the anti-democratic movement: Make a bigger effort to win working-class votes.) The Constitution lets state legislatures set the rules for choosing presidential electors.\", \"\\u201cNone of this is happening behind closed doors,\\u201d Jamelle Bouie, a Times columnist, recently wrote. \\u201cWe are headed for a crisis of some sort. When it comes, we can be shocked that it is actually happening, but we shouldn\\u2019t be surprised.\\u201d\", \"Here is an overview of recent developments:\", \"Arizona. Republican legislators have passed a law taking away authority over election lawsuits from the secretary of state, who\\u2019s now a Democrat, and giving it to the attorney general, a Republican. Legislators are debating another bill that would allow them to revoke election certification \\u201cby majority vote at any time before the presidential inauguration.\\u201d\", \"Georgia. Last year, Brad Raffensperger, Georgia\\u2019s Republican secretary of state, helped stop Trump\\u2019s attempts to reverse the result. State legislators in Georgia have since weakened his powers, and a Trump-backed candidate is running to replace Raffensperger next year. Republicans have also passed a law that gives a commission they control the power to remove local election officials.\", \"Michigan. Kristina Karamo, a Trump-endorsed candidate who has repeated the lie that the 2020 elections were fraudulent, is running for secretary of state, the office that oversees elections. (Republican candidates are running on similar messages in Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and elsewhere, according to ABC News.)\", \"Pennsylvania. Republicans are trying to amend the state\\u2019s Constitution to make the secretary of state an elected position, rather than one that the governor appoints. Pennsylvania is also one of the states where Trump allies \\u2014 like Stephen Lindemuth, who attended the Jan. 6 rally that turned into an attack on Congress \\u2014 have won local races to oversee elections.\", \"Wisconsin. Senator Ron Johnson is urging the Republican-controlled Legislature to take full control of federal elections. Doing so could remove the governor, currently a Democrat, from the process, and weaken the bipartisan state elections commission.\", \"The new anti-democratic movement may still fail. This year, for example, Republican legislators in seven states proposed bills that would have given partisan officials a direct ability to change election results. None of the bills passed.\", \"Arguably the most important figures on this issue are Republican officials and voters who believe in democracy and are uncomfortable with using raw political power to overturn an election result.\", \"Miles Taylor, a former Trump administration official, has helped to start the Renew America Movement, which supports candidates \\u2014 of either party \\u2014 running against Trump-backed Republicans. It is active in congressional races but does not have enough resources to compete in the state contests that often determine election procedures, Taylor told The Times.\", \"Gellman, the Atlantic writer, argues that Democrats and independents \\u2014 as well as journalists \\u2014 can make a difference by paying more attention. \\u201cGrass-roots organizers who are in support of democratic institutions,\\u201d he said on NPR, \\u201ccould be doing what the Republicans are doing at the precinct and the county and the state level in terms of organizing to control election authorities to ensure that they remain nonpartisan or neutral.\\u201d\", \"For more: Mark Meadows, Trump\\u2019s former chief of staff, was involved in fighting the election outcome, according to the House Committee investigating the Capitol attack.\", \"The climate crisis is reshaping the planet. Here\\u2019s what it looks like in 193 countries.\", \"Gail Collins and Bret Stephens discuss inflation and crime.\", \"And just like that: It\\u2019s Peloton vs. \\u201cSex and the City.\\u201d\", \"The Media Equation: A climate-change comedy nails the media\\u2019s failures.\", \"Quiz time: The average score on our latest news quiz was 8.6. See how well you do.\", \"Advice from Wirecutter: Beware overpriced, mediocre wines.\", \"Lives Lived: Anne Rice wrote more than 30 novels, including the best seller \\u201cInterview With the Vampire.\\u201d She died at 80.\", \"Vicente Fern\\u00e1ndez was a powerful tenor whose songs of love, loss and patriotism inspired by life in rural Mexico endeared him to fans as \\u201cEl Rey.\\u201d He died at 81.\", \"If you\\u2019ve watched \\u201cThe Beatles: Get Back,\\u201d Peter Jackson\\u2019s documentary about the album \\u201cLet It Be,\\u201d you\\u2019ll have noticed Yoko Ono, sitting by John Lennon\\u2019s side and performing mundane tasks like opening mail.\", \"\\u201cAt first I found Ono\\u2019s omnipresence in the documentary bizarre\\u201d The Times\\u2019s Amanda Hess writes. But as more of the footage played, \\u201cI found myself impressed by her stamina, then entranced by the provocation of her existence and ultimately dazzled by her.\\u201d\", \"Some people are seeing the documentary as proof that Ono wasn\\u2019t responsible for the band\\u2019s 1970 breakup, a rumor that is tinged with misogyny and racism.\", \"Ono was vigilant about not being a typical artist\\u2019s wife, Amanda writes. Or, as Ono herself said about women in rock in a 1997 interview: \\u201cMy first impression was that they were all wives, kind of sitting in the next room while the guys were talking. I was afraid of being something like that.\\u201d \\u2014 Claire Moses, a Morning writer\", \"This shrimp stew requires minimal prep and cooks quickly.\", \"\\u201cSesame Street\\u201d was always political: A documentary on HBO explains.\", \"The best poetry of the year, according to our columnist.\", \"Kate McKinnon returned to \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d as Dr. Anthony Fauci.\", \"The pangram from Friday\\u2019s Spelling Bee was longboat.
