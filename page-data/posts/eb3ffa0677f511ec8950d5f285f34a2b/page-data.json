Most communications to Tonga have been cut after the main undersea communications cable lost power.\", \"American meteorologist, Chris Vagasky, studied lightning around the volcano and found it increasing to about 30,000 strikes in the days leading up to the eruption. On the day of the eruption, he detected 400,000 lightning events in just three hours, which comes down to 100 lightning events per second.\", \"That compared with 8,000 strikes per hour during the Anak Krakatau eruption in 2018, caused part of the crater to collapse into the Sunda Strait and send a tsunami crashing into western Java, which killed hundreds of people.\", \"Cas said it is difficult to predict follow-up activity and that the volcano's vents could continue to release gases and other material for weeks or months.\", \"\\\"It wouldn't be unusual to get a few more eruptions, though maybe not as big as Saturday,\\\" he said. \\\"Once the volcano is de-gassed, it will settle down.\\\"\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"eb3ffa0677f511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eb3ffa0677f511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
