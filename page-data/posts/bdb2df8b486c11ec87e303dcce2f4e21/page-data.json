Her Papa is a semiretired goldsmith who struggles to keep them fed. Sparkle resorts to picking damaged produce off the floor at the market for their dinner.\", \"It is after one of these trips that she comes across a soca dance group and is mesmerized. The women are free and sensual, displaying a confidence and self-possession that is appealing to the 17-year-old Sparkle. But after she joins the group, she realizes that acceptance, and profit, come at a high price to women.\", \"\\u201cShe Paradise\\u201d reveals the contradictions that women both endure and embody on their path to success. The dance crew members spend as much time uplifting each other as they do undercutting one another, often in one breath. Many scenes hone in on the women\\u2019s bodies: the sweat on their bellies or their flexing muscles, emphasizing the labor of their performance, as well as how these can be vehicles for both commodification and empowerment.\", \"But the film struggles at being compelling. Little is clarified about Sparkle\\u2019s back-story or personal motivations. Though Nestor\\u2019s understated performance is powerful at times, one leaves the film not fully satisfied, wanting for a stronger arc.\"]","href_hash":"bdb2df8b486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bdb2df8b486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}},
