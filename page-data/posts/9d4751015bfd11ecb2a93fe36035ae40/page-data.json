But few noticed Mr. Crenshaw\\u2019s lie because he didn\\u2019t say it on Facebook, or on Fox News. Instead, he sent the false message directly to the inboxes of his constituents and supporters in a fund-raising email.\", \"Lawmakers\\u2019 statements on social media and cable news are now routinely fact-checked and scrutinized. But email \\u2014 one of the most powerful communication tools available to politicians, reaching up to hundreds of thousands of people \\u2014 teems with unfounded claims and largely escapes notice.\", \"The New York Times signed up in August for the campaign lists of the 390 senators and representatives running for re-election in 2022 whose websites offered that option, and read more than 2,500 emails from those campaigns to track how widely false and misleading statements were being used to help fill political coffers.\", \"Both parties delivered heaps of hyperbole in their emails. One Republican, for instance, declared that Democrats wanted to establish a \\u201cone-party socialist state,\\u201d while a Democrat suggested that the party\\u2019s Jan. 6 inquiry was at imminent risk because the G.O.P. \\u201ccould force the whole investigation to end early.\\u201d\", \"But Republicans included misinformation far more often: in about 15 percent of their messages, compared with about 2 percent for Democrats. In addition, multiple Republicans often spread the same unfounded claims, whereas Democrats rarely repeated one another\\u2019s.\", \"At least eight Republican lawmakers sent fund-raising emails containing a brazen distortion of a potential settlement with migrants separated from their families during the Trump administration. One of them, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, falsely claimed that President Biden was \\u201cgiving every illegal immigrant that comes into our country $450,000.\\u201d\", \"Those claims were grounded in news that the Justice Department was negotiating payments to settle lawsuits filed on behalf of immigrant families whom the Trump administration had separated, some of whom have not been reunited. But the payments, which are not final and could end up being smaller, would be limited to that small fraction of migrants.\", \"The relatively small number of false statements from Democrats were mostly about abortion. For instance, an email from Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York said the Mississippi law before the Supreme Court was \\u201cnearly identical to the one in Texas, banning abortions after 6 weeks,\\u201d but Mississippi\\u2019s law bans abortion after 15 weeks and does not include the vigilante enforcement mechanism that is a defining characteristic of Texas\\u2019 law.\", \"A spokeswoman for Ms. Maloney called the inaccuracy an \\u201chonest mistake\\u201d and said the campaign would check future emails more carefully.\", \"Campaign representatives for Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Crenshaw did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Republican House and Senate campaign committees also did not respond to a request for comment.\", \"Politicians have exaggerated and dissembled since time immemorial, including in their email dispatches. But the volume, the baldness and the reach of the false claims have increased.\", \"The emails reviewed by The Times illuminate how ubiquitous misinformation has become among Republicans, fueled in large part by former President Donald J. Trump. And the misinformation is not coming only, or even primarily, from the handful who get national attention for it.\", \"The people behind campaign emails have \\u201crealized the more extreme the claim, the better the response,\\u201d said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. \\u201cThe more that it elicits red-hot anger, the more likely people donate. And it just contributes to the perversion of our democratic process. It contributes to the incivility and indecency of political behavior.\\u201d\", \"The messages also underscore how, for all the efforts to compel platforms like Facebook and Twitter to address falsehoods, many of the same claims are flowing through other powerful channels with little notice.\", \"For fact checkers and other watchdogs, \\u201cit\\u2019s hard to know what it is that politicians are saying directly to individual supporters in their inboxes,\\u201d said Jennifer Stromer-Galley, a professor in the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University.\", \"\\u201cAnd politicians know that,\\u201d she said. \\u201cPoliticians and the consulting firms behind them, they know that this kind of messaging is not monitored to the same extent, so they can be more carefree with what they\\u2019re saying.\\u201d\", \"Email is a crucial tool in political fund-raising because it costs campaigns almost nothing and can be extremely effective: When campaigns invest in it, it routinely accounts for a majority of their online fund-raising. Supporters are bombarded \\u2014 sometimes daily \\u2014 with messages meant to make them angry, because strategists know anger motivates voters.\", \"In many cases, candidates used anger-inducing misinformation directly in their requests for a donation. For instance, after his false claim about payments to immigrants, Mr. Kennedy \\u2014 who began the email by declaring himself \\u201cmad as a murder hornet\\u201d \\u2014 included a link labeled \\u201cRUSH $500 TO STOP ILLEGAL PAYMENTS!\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m watching Joe Biden pay illegals to come into our country, and it\\u2019s all being paid for by raising YOUR taxes,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t let Biden pass out hundreds of thousands of dollars to every Tom, Dick and Harry that wants to come into our country illegally.\\u201d\", \"Several other Republicans, including Representative Vern Buchanan of Florida, also claimed that the payments would go to all undocumented immigrants. Others, including Senator Todd Young of Indiana, tucked the context inside emails with misleading subject lines such as \\u201cBREAKING: Biden wants to pay illegal immigrants $450,000 each for breaking our laws.\\u201d\", \"Of 28 emails that included the $450,000 figure, only eight contextualized it accurately.\", \"Campaign representatives for Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Young did not respond to requests for comment, and calls to Mr. Steube\\u2019s campaign and congressional offices were not returned.\", \"Another common line was that the Justice Department was targeting parents as \\u201cdomestic terrorists\\u201d for challenging the teaching of critical race theory, an advanced academic framework that conservatives are using as shorthand for how some curriculums cover race and racism \\u2014 or, alternatively, for challenging pandemic-related restrictions.\", \"\\u201cParents are simply protesting a radical curriculum in public schools, and Biden wants the parents labeled terrorists,\\u201d read an email from Representative Jake LaTurner of Kansas. \\u201cWill you consider donating now to help us fight back against this disgusting abuse of power?\\u201d\", \"This misinformation \\u2014 echoed in emails from Mr. Crenshaw, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Young, Representative Jim Hagedorn of Minnesota and Representative Elise Stefanik of New York \\u2014 emerged after Attorney General Merrick Garland sent a memorandum on Oct. 4 directing the F.B.I. to address threats against school personnel and school board members. (Some opponents of curriculums and pandemic protocols have sent death threats, vandalized homes and otherwise acted menacingly.) The memo explicitly distinguished between dissent and threats, and did not call anyone a domestic terrorist. The Republican narrative conflates it with a letter the National School Boards Association, an independent group, sent to the Justice Department a few days earlier.\", \"Representatives for Ms. Stefanik and Mr. Hagedorn said the association had \\u201ccoordinated\\u201d with the Biden administration on the letter, citing recent news reports. Those reports say the school boards association discussed the letter with the administration and, at the administration\\u2019s request, added details about the threats; they do not show the Justice Department endorsing the \\u201cterrorist\\u201d label or criminalizing nonviolent opposition to curriculums.\", \"Campaign representatives for Mr. Crenshaw, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. LaTurner and Mr. Young did not respond to requests for comment.\", \"Combating misinformation in emails is difficult both because of the private nature of the medium and because its targets are predisposed to believe it \\u2014 though Emily Thorson, a political scientist at Syracuse, noted that the fact that the recipients were likely to already be staunch partisans reduced the chances of misinformation reaching people whose views would be changed by it.\", \"Professor Thorson said what concerned her more was that \\u2014 unlike much of the misinformation on social media \\u2014 these claims came from people with authority and were being spread repetitively. That is how lies that the 2020 election was rigged gained traction: not \\u201cbecause of random videos on Facebook but because it was a coherent message echoed by a lot of elites,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThose are the ones that we need to be most worried about.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Luntz, the Republican pollster, runs frequent focus groups with voters and said they tended to accept misinformation uncritically.\", \"\\u201cIt may be a fund-raising pitch, but very often people look at it as a campaign pitch,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey think of it as context, they think of it as information \\u2014 they don\\u2019t necessarily see this as fund-raising, even though that\\u2019s what it is. And so misleading them in an attempt to divide them from their money is pure evil, because you\\u2019re taking advantage of people who just don\\u2019t know the difference.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9d4751015bfd11ecb2a93fe36035ae40"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9d4751015bfd11ecb2a93fe36035ae40"}},
