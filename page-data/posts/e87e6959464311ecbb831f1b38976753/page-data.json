It was very hard to perform it live. Now for me, honestly, this song is 100 percent about us and for you.\\u201d\", \"Several people were already in tears \\u2014 having burst into heaving, Beatlemania-style sobs as soon as Swift appeared in a regal purple pantsuit \\u2014 but at this admission they cried audibly harder. \\u201cMy actual mother!\\u201d one young woman gasped. Another, seated directly and perhaps precariously behind me, muttered repeatedly, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to throw up.\\u201d\", \"Few A-list musicians of this millennium have sustained a bond with their fans as intensely as Swift with her \\u201cSwifties.\\u201d To her credit, she feeds them well. She drops Easter eggs like a benevolent mother hen, arranges elaborate meet-and-greets, and once invited some fans over to her house to listen to her new album while munching on cookies she\\u2019d baked for them.\", \"At the Friday event (for a video starring the actors Dylan O\\u2019Brien and Sadie Sink), each audience member received an autographed movie poster and \\u2014 the song is a famous weepie \\u2014 a custom packet of \\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d tissues.\", \"But with all the fanfare around the release of the extended track, a certain shared intimacy was about to be lost, too. \\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d has been more of a communal secret than a hit, the favorite track of true Swift connoisseurs and, often, music critics (this one included). Now the song \\u2014 which appears on \\u201cRed (Taylor\\u2019s Version),\\u201d the latest album she rerecorded so she can control its masters \\u2014 was accompanied by a music video so lengthy and elaborate that Swift was staging a premiere for it and calling it a \\u201cshort film.\\u201d\", \"Part of what fans feel for \\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d is nostalgia for an earlier part of Swift\\u2019s career and, by extension, their own lives. \\u201cRed\\u201d is perhaps the most transitional of her nine albums, a bridge that marked the beginning of Swift\\u2019s pop crossover but also the moment before her songwriting became as sleek and streamlined as it would on her next album, the blockbuster 2014 release \\u201c1989.\\u201d\", \"And so the eclectic \\u201cRed\\u201d juxtaposes the Max Martin-assisted pop of \\u201cI Knew You Were Trouble\\u201d and \\u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\u201d with the coffee shop folksiness of \\u201cTreacherous,\\u201d \\u201cI Almost Do\\u201d and \\u201cBegin Again.\\u201d An achingly rendered portrait of a breakup, \\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d represents the artistic peak of the more singer-songwriter-oriented sound, and the closing of a chapter in Swift\\u2019s evolution: It is, at least to date, the last song she wrote with one of her most trusted early collaborators, the country songwriter Liz Rose.\", \"\\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d got its start during a rehearsal soundcheck, when Swift began playing the same four chords and ad-libbing lines about a relationship that had recently ended. \\u201cThe song kept building in intensity,\\u201d she later recalled. Wisely, her sound engineer captured the impromptu jam session, and Swift later brought this recording to Rose.\", \"Part of the reason Swift wrote her 2010 album, \\u201cSpeak Now,\\u201d entirely on her own was to silence the skeptics who believed that Rose had a heavier hand in her music than Swift had admitted. But in a 2014 interview, Rose said that she acted \\u201cmore like an editor.\\u201d \\u201cTaylor is good because she has lyrics that work for her age,\\u201d Rose said. \\u201cI just help her grab the ones that are great.\\u201d\", \"The 10-minute \\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d illuminates this process: It is angrier, far less filtered and more explicit in every sense of the word. The five-and-a-half-minute cut of \\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d that appeared on \\u201cRed\\u201d was an achievement of taut, streamlined storytelling and vividly spot-lit details. The new version knows no such restraint. It is gloriously unruly and viciously seething. With its release, the millennial \\u201cYou\\u2019re So Vain\\u201d has suddenly become the millennial \\u201cIdiot Wind.\\u201d\", \"In both its incarnations, \\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d is a song about the weaponization of memory. The devil is in the details, the more specific, the more they seem to assert, in the face of an unfeeling and perhaps manipulatively disbelieving ex, that this experience really happened: a lost scarf, the way an open refrigerator illuminated a dark kitchen.\", \"But for all its hyper-personalization \\u2014 and for the public\\u2019s somewhat excessive fixation on the famous actor who is rumored to have inspired it \\u2014 \\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d is also, quite poignantly, about a young woman\\u2019s attempt to find retroactive equilibrium in a relationship that was based on a power imbalance that she was not at first able to perceive.\", \"The most striking lyric in the new version references the age gap between an older man and a younger woman: \\u201cYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine/And that made me want to die.\\u201d While the song\\u2019s subject is never accused of doing anything much worse than some mild gaslighting and hypocritical key chain-owning, \\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d parallels the emotional work that many women have been privately undertaking in the wake of the #MeToo movement: Looking back on past encounters or relationships that left them with a seemingly outsize feeling of unease; wondering what exactly constitutes exploitation or emotional abuse; wishing they could go back and extend some compassion or wisdom to their vulnerable younger selves.\", \"For the elegant simplicity of its structure, the shorter version of \\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d is by far the better song. But the power of the new version comes from its unapologetic messiness, the way it allows a woman\\u2019s subjective emotional experience to take up a defiantly excessive amount of time and space. That was most apparent when Swift played the entire song this weekend on \\u201cSaturday Night Live.\\u201d During a transfixing performance, she moved through a cycle of feelings as elemental as the seasons: the springlike flutter of new romance, the summery heat of passion, the autumnal operatics of grief, and finally \\u2014 as snow fell around her in the song\\u2019s last moments \\u2014 the cooling relief of long-delayed acceptance.\", \"Swift hasn\\u2019t written a breakup song nearly as scorching in the decade since \\u201cAll Too Well,\\u201d and for the past several years she\\u2019s kept her seemingly less melodramatic relationship with her boyfriend Joe Alwyn as far from the public eye as she can. On her more recent albums, \\u201cFolklore\\u201d and \\u201cEvermore,\\u201d she\\u2019s revisited the acoustic sound that characterized the quieter side of \\u201cRed\\u201d while writing more character-driven songs than the candidly autobiographical work for which she was once known and unfairly criticized. But in revisiting the old hurts of \\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d on such a public stage, she seems once again to be bridging two phases of her career, reinhabiting her 21-year-old self as though she were a complex, intuitively understood fictional character.\", \"Occasionally, during her \\u201cS.N.L.\\u201d performance, Swift looked directly into the camera and delivered a few glances that could have sliced through diamond. Some might have believed she was eying her ex, who may or may not still be in possession of that fabled scarf. But the truth was that the song isn\\u2019t just about him anymore. It\\u2019s also about the fans, the depths they\\u2019d heard in it before anyone else, and whatever and whoever they still wished they could forget.\"]","href_hash":"e87e6959464311ecbb831f1b38976753"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e87e6959464311ecbb831f1b38976753"}},
