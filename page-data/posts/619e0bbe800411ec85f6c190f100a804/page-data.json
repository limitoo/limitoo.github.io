will \\\"stop the movement of people and flatten the curve of new infections and hospitalisations\\\".\", \"Lockouts, which restrict the movement of unvaccinated people, are currently in place in Alice Springs, Amoonguna, Yuendumu and Yuelamu until at least Sunday.\\u00a0\", \"The letter\\u00a0lists a range of \\\"failures\\\" by the NT government, including the \\\"late\\\" introduction of a Territory-wide mask mandate which Aboriginal health groups had been calling for prior to the measure's introduction.\", \"Since the territory re-opened its borders on December 20, the numbers of hospitalisations and caseloads across the NT have\\u00a0grown substantially.\\u00a0\", \"Today, the NT reported a new record of 940 new coronavirus cases, with a record number of 105 COVID-19 patients in hospital.\", \"Nine out of 10 of the COVID-19 patients currently in NT hospitals are Aboriginal people.\", \"<img
