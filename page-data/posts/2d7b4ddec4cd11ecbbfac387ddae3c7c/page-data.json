Sams has been working at the Health and Human Services Department. The Washington Post first reported the personnel moves.\", \"Their arrival comes amid forecasts by pollsters and pundits that Republicans are likely to take the House majority in the midterm elections this year and launch what will likely be a slew of GOP-led investigations. The Post reported part of Dunn's role will include responding to potential GOP probes, which CBS News has not independently confirmed. But Dunn's four decades in presidential politics give her ample experience in weathering political storms.\\u00a0\", \"Dunn rejoins the White House from the political consulting firm she cofounded, SKDK.\", \"In the first months of the Biden White House, Dunn played a behind-the-scenes role as a special government employee, a type of position often criticized because it doesn't require filing a public financial disclosure like other presidential appointee posts. Dunn assumed a West Wing role focusing on implementing the president's agenda in his first months in office.\\u00a0\", \"Dunn played a pivotal role in Mr. Biden's ultimately successful presidential campaign as one of his most trusted advisers, and she also co-chaired the Biden-Harris Transition Team.\\u00a0\", \"During the Obama White House, she served as acting White House communications director, and close adviser to the president.\\u00a0\", \"\\u2014 CBS News' Arden Farhi, Kathryn Watson and Jenna Gibson contributed to this report.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"2d7b4ddec4cd11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2d7b4ddec4cd11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
