But he acknowledged the outcome might have fallen short of some of the players\\u2019 expectations.\", \"It also ended their brief stay atop the group standings in Concacaf. Canada beat Mexico, 2-1, in snowy Edmonton hours after the United States tied Jamaica. That victory sent the Canadians in the top spot \\u2014 for the moment \\u2014 as they try to qualify for their first World Cup since 1986. \", \"Mexico slipped to third, just behind the United States, which will visit Canada in January. The top three teams in the group qualify automatically for next year\\u2019s World Cup in Qatar. The fourth-place finisher can still make the field through a playoff with a team from another region.\", \"Heading into the match, Berhalter said, he had warned his young players about letting their energy levels dip after their big win over Mexico.\", \"\\u201cIn the coaching world you talk about trap games,\\u201d Berhalter had said. \\u201cYou talk about putting that last game behind you, and the next game is the most important game.\\u201d\", \"He called Tuesday\\u2019s meeting against Jamaica a \\u201cmassive game.\\u201d But neither the team\\u2019s play nor the atmosphere reflected that premise.\", \"The stands were mostly empty as a result of pandemic restrictions, and the match played out on a dry, tattered field that grew increasingly shredded as the minutes progressed.\", \"On the ragged grass, each team was at least able to each create one moment of beauty.\", \"In the 11th minute, a give-and-go with Ricardo Pepi sent Weah skipping dangerously into the penalty area, where a crowd of Jamaicans awaited. But Weah kept going, dancing through two defenders, keeping his balance while tiptoeing around a last-gasp challenge, before flicking the ball with his left foot off the far post and into the net.\", \"Weah said the game held special meaning for him: While his father is the former world player of the year George Weah, the current president of Liberia, his mother\\u2019s side of the family is Jamaican, and his aunt was at the game.\", \"\\u201cMy parents, they talked to me about it,\\u201d Weah said before the game. \\u201cThey said don\\u2019t go too hard on their country. But obviously business is business.\\u201d\", \"Jamaica meant business, too. Michail Antonio, the third-leading scorer in the English Premier League, evened the score in thrilling fashion only 11 minutes later when he dribbled into a cubbyhole of a space more than 30 yards from the goal and decided to blast a speculative shot toward the net. The ball sailed over the outstretched arms of the American goalkeeper, Zack Steffen, and under the crossbar, sparking cheers from the sparse, happily stunned crowd.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s one of those goals where you just turn around and clap your hands and say, \\u2018Amazing goal, amazing individual effort,\\u2019\\u201d Berhalter said.\", \"Jamaica had been flat through the first seven games of World Cup qualifying, accumulating only six points of a possible 21. But the United States has historically struggled to make an impact in Kingston, having collected one win, one loss and four draws in its previous six World Cup qualifying games in Jamaica before Tuesday.\", \"The Jamaicans lacked ambition and ideas at times on offense, but they made up for it with a level of physicality bordering on roughness. They appeared to take the lead in the dying minutes of the game when Damion Lowe scored on a header. But he was whistled for a foul (a call that replays showed to be questionable) that negated the goal.\", \"The United States looked pedestrian too, particularly in the midfield, where the presence of Weston McKennie, who missed the game because of yellow card accumulation, seemed to be missed.\", \"\\u201cIt was a great experience for our team to go through that,\\u201d said Berhalter, who noted that the field conditions had disrupted some of his team\\u2019s passing efforts, \\u201cbut you can see the guys are disappointed.\\u201d\", \"Christian Pulisic, who had scored against Mexico but is still working his way back to fitness from a high ankle sprain, entered the game as a substitute with about half an hour to go. Coming into the game in a similar situation on Friday, he had headed in the go-ahead goal.\", \"But he failed to conjure any salve for the Americans\\u2019 problems on Tuesday night, leaving the United States wondering where all the energy and urgency went.\"]","href_hash":"c9a07439485311ec937cb56421c76c95"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c9a07439485311ec937cb56421c76c95"}},
