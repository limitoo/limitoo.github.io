As it stands, the sentencing is one of the longest federal drugs sentences ever in Western Washington, according to the Associated Press.\", \"Along with the supplies, there was also $1.1 million discovered throughout the headquarters of Woolard's operation. Over several weeks, federal agents did four searches to completely recover the money, finding it in places like a hole below the dishwasher and beneath the bathroom sink floorboards. Along with the million dollars, agents found a secret room housing over two dozen guns, homemade silencers, and thousands of rounds of ammunition.\", \"\\\"It's a lot of money. It's a lot of drugs. It's a tragedy,\\\" U.S. District Judge Coughenour said.\", \"The operation started in 2015 when Woolard, 42, and Pelayo ordered fentanyl powder from China. This was when synthetic opioid was beginning to emerge as a cheaper, stronger, and deadlier alternative to heroin. They made the pills look like oxycodone someone could get from a pharmacy with stamps that marked the product \\\"M30.\\\"\", \"They also purchased pill presses, learning to use them in a workshop at Woolard's home in Arlington, then at Pelayo's nearby property.\", \"\\\"The presses used by Mr. Woolard and Mr. Pelayo were capable of pressing thousands of pills an hour, and Mr. Woolard and Mr. Pelayo pressed so many pills over the course of the conspiracy that they wore out multiple presses,\\\" assistant U.S. attorneys Karyn S. Johnson and Mike Lang wrote in a sentencing memo.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942797/bradley-woolard-anthony-pelayo-fentanyl-sentencing.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Bradley Woolard and Anthony Pelayo were able to make their fentayl-laced pills look like pharmacy-grade oxycodone through the use of a stamp that marked the pills with a \\\"M30.\\\" In this photo, a bag of assorted pills and prescription drugs dropped off for disposal is displayed during the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 20th National Prescription Drug Take Back Day at Watts Healthcare on April 24 in Los Angeles, California. </div>\", \"Their case offers a look at how the production of counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl or related drugs became a cottage industry across the country in those years. They enlisted a number of other people to receive shipments of fentanyl powder they ordered on the \\\"dark web\\\" using bitcoin or wire transfers; investigators initially didn't know if the different shipments were part of the same conspiracy. Some of the shipments were labeled \\\"lab supplies.\\\"\", \"Because the pair were manufacturers and wholesalers, agents were unable to link any overdoses to their operation.\", \"But deaths from synthetic opioid overdoses soared in Snohomish County while the conspiracy was active\\u2014from eight in 2015, to 13 in 2016, to 26 in 2017 and 58 in 2018, according to data from the Addictions, Drug and Alcohol Institute at the University of Washington.\", \"The number of people overdosing on fentanyl has only skyrocketed since then, in Snohomish County, Washington state and across the country, with massive amounts of the drug being smuggled in from Mexico in recent years, federal authorities said. Overdose deaths have soared to about 100,000 per year nationally.\", \"Lang told the judge Tuesday that he looked for people ravaged by the pills Woolard sold, some of whom likely did not even realize they were taking fentanyl.\", \"\\\"It's hard to find them,\\\" he said. \\\"They don't show up in the courtroom. But they have a voice. There is suffering out there.\\\"\", \"A jury convicted Woolard and Pelayo of drug, gun and money laundering charges in August after a two-week trial. A top distributor, Jerome Isham, was also convicted of drug and gun charges. Eight other people were also charged in the case, with several, including Woolard's estranged wife, receiving lighter sentences after cooperating with investigators.\", \"The U.S. Attorney's Office sought 25 years for Pelayo, of Marysville, who was convicted of an additional gun charge, before Coughenour sentenced him to 15 years last week. Isham got 10 years.\", \"Woolard and Pelayo both have young children. Neither had significant criminal records or had ever been convicted of using violence, though prosecutors said Woolard threatened to kill a cooperating witness.\", \"\\\"They make me sound like Pablo Escobar of Marysville, which is not true,\\\" Pelayo told the judge at his sentencing.\", \"While Pelayo indicated in text messages to others that he wouldn't take the pills he helped make because they were too dangerous, Woolard had a long-running pill addiction that began after he broke his ankle in 2001. His habit ran about $1,000 a day by the time he was arrested, he wrote in a letter to the judge.\", \"Woolard spent some of the proceeds of the conspiracy attending spa-like drug treatment resorts in Costa Rica and Mexico at a cost of $30,000 to $50,000 per month.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942798/fentanyl-bradley-woolard-sentencing-drug-bust.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Bradley Woolard and Anthony Pelayo's drug operation began in 2015 when they purchased fentanyl powder from China in a time where synthetic opioid was becoming a cheaper, stronger, and deadlier alternative to heroin.
