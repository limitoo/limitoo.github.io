If you don\\u2019t already receive the daily newsletter, sign up here.\", \"By nearly any measure, deal making in 2021 was one for the record books.\", \"\\u201cThese are activity levels that I have never seen before at any time, having been in the business over the last quarter-century,\\u201d said Stephan Feldgoise, Goldman Sachs\\u2019s co-head of global M&A.\", \"Many corporate boards felt pressure from investors to bulk up their businesses, propelling M&A higher. Others were ordered to slim down and focus, with General Electric, Johnson & Johnson and Toshiba all announcing plans to split their operations within days of each other, generating more transactions \\u2014 and fees for their advisers.\", \"Private equity deal making was on fire, with a record $1.1 trillion in deals struck this year, according to Refinitiv. Feldgoise said that\\u2019s because buyout firms have enjoyed huge returns on asset sales and, having raised enormous war chests in recent years, have more money than ever that they need to put to work.\", \"Yet, what was by far the hottest deal trend of 2020, the special-purpose acquisition company, quieted down after a rollicking start to 2021. Experts chalk up the drop to a glut of blank-check funds hitting the market: SPACs comprised 20 percent of mergers in the first quarter. The flood of SPACs made it harder for these funds to raise financing, while poor post-deal performance and closer scrutiny by regulators interrupted the party mood.\", \"Aside from these record-breaking trends, 2021 had plenty of memorable moments: Media moguls hatched audacious deals, geopolitics scrambled companies\\u2019 plans and meme stocks became a thing. Here are some of the most consequential deal making developments of the year, according to the DealBook team. \\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\", \"Dealmakers of the year: Step forward, David Zaslav and Keith Creel. Mr. Zaslav, the chief of Discovery, maneuvered himself to the helm of a blockbuster media deal that combined his firm with AT&T\\u2019s larger WarnerMedia unit in a $43 billion deal. Mr. Creel, who leads the railroad operator Canadian Pacific, beat out his former employer, Canadian National, in a long-running bidding war for Kansas City Southern that had more twists and turns than a steep mountain pass. What\\u2019s more, his $31 billion winning bid was lower than the rival offer, but won the day when it brought more regulatory certainty.\", \"Dealbreakers of the year: Hello, Lina Khan and Gary Gensler. As part of his push to rein in corporate power, President Biden\\u2019s picks to run key regulatory agencies \\u2014 Ms. Khan at the Federal Trade Commission and Mr. Gensler at the Securities and Exchange Commission \\u2014 rattled boardrooms and trading floors from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. Big Tech firms preemptively petitioned for Ms. Khan to recuse herself from antitrust investigations and Mr. Gensler\\u2019s speeches about tightening rules for crypto, SPACs and other industries made waves.\", \"Deal that captured the 2021 zeitgeist: In the year of the meme stock, Robinhood reigned. The no-fee brokerage firm, whose app was the tool of choice for traders who fueled the frenzy in GameStop, AMC and others, went public in July and briefly became a meme stock itself. It has since given up its early gains, like many other meme stocks.\", \"The deal that never was: The $30 billion acquisition of Willis Towers Watson by Aon was announced with great fanfare \\u2014 for an insurance deal \\u2014 in March 2020, and things went slowly downhill from there. The Justice Department sued in June this year to block the deal, and the companies gave up about a month later, rather than fight it in court. It was the Biden administration\\u2019s first challenge to a potential merger, and its success set the tone for a broader push against corporate consolidation.\", \"Do-over deal: Less than a week after Didi\\u2019s blockbuster initial public offering in New York in June, China cracked down on the Beijing-based company, halting new user sign-ups and ordering it off app stores. Caught in the escalating tension between China and the United States, Didi\\u2019s time in New York didn\\u2019t last long: Six months after its I.P.O., during which its market value fell by half, Didi announced that it would delist from New York and shift its shares to Hong Kong.\", \"Deal of the year, D.C. edition: What started as a $2 trillion proposal that included money for \\u201chuman infrastructure\\u201d like home health care emerged from the horse-trading process as a narrower $1 trillion package focused on the physical upkeep of roads, bridges, public transit and broadband internet. Still, President Biden\\u2019s bill, signed into law last month, represented the largest investment in infrastructure in more than a generation \\u2014 and an increasingly rare example of bipartisan compromise.\", \"Crypto\\u2019s coming out party: It was a big year for all things crypto, but Coinbase stood out. The cryptocurrency exchange\\u2019s public listing in April, which saw its value climb to nearly $90 billion on its first day of trading, marked the moment that dealing in digital tokens went mainstream. Well, that and all the crypto firms hiring lobbyists in Washington.\", \"Trader of the year: Some investors rely on sophisticated algorithms to tell them when to buy and sell. The richest man in the world just runs a Twitter poll. He asked his millions of followers if he should sell 10 percent of his considerable holdings in Tesla, they said yes, and he obliged. The abrupt sale of more than $10 billion in stock, and counting, made more sense when it became clear that Mr. Musk was already facing a huge tax bill for exercising stock options due to expire. Also, he regularly demonstrated his ability to move the price of Bitcoin with his tweets \\u2014 and managed to give Dogecoin a shout out on \\u201cSaturday Night Live.\\u201d\", \"SPAC innovatation attempt of the year: Bill Ackman\\u2019s $4 billion special purpose acquisition company is the largest ever raised, and when it identified a deal target this year, it broke more new ground: A complex proposal to buy 10 percent of Universal Music, which unexpectedly spawned a new species of blank-check firm as part of the transaction. Alas, the deal was rebuffed by regulators and the SPAC was hit with a lawsuit. The billionaire\\u2019s hedge fund bought the Universal stake instead, but he pressed ahead with his plan for a new type of vehicle, which he called a SPARC, that he said improves on the traditional SPAC structure. In a SPARC, investors put in no money upfront and sponsors, like Ackman, have no deadline to find a merger partner. It\\u2019s a blank check for a blank check. (Regulators are wary of that, too.)\", \"Most shocking SPAC deals: Electric vehicle makers have charged into SPAC mergers, but some high-profile companies short-circuited this year: Nikola and Lordstown ousted their chiefs as they struggled to fulfill lofty promises. (Nikola\\u2019s Trevor Milton was later charged with fraud.) Speaking of lofty promises, a spate of electric flying taxi companies also inked SPAC deals this year, and some found the going as tough as for their ground-based counterparts: Archer Aviation was mired in a legal battle over trade secrets shortly after announcing its merger with a SPAC.\", \"Deal we didn\\u2019t see coming: Ken Griffin, the chief of the hedge fund Citadel, won an auction for a rare original copy of the U.S. constitution with a bid of $43.2 million \\u2014 beating out a group of crypto traders who had pooled millions of dollars to bid on the document.\", \"Deal we should have seen coming: Former President Donald Trump, no stranger to complicated financial dealings, entered the world of SPACs via a convoluted deal to take his start-up social media company public. Shortly thereafter, the blank-check company, Digital World, disclosed that it was being investigated by the S.E.C.\", \"What do you think? Which deals and dealmakers deserve recognition?
