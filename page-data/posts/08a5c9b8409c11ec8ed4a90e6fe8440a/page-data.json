She was 79.\", \"Her nephew Michael Berkowitz confirmed the death but did not specify a cause.\", \"Ms. Romagnoli was a sharp and charismatic businesswoman who worked her way up through Manhattan\\u2019s bars and restaurants before opening her own venues, which became watering holes for queer activists, artists and other patrons from all over the city.\", \"In 1972, she turned a two-story space on Third Street in the West Village into Bonnie & Clyde\\u2019s, an eccentric nightclub with a restaurant on the second floor and a pool table. The staff was all female, and the tabletops were covered in laminated photos of women.\", \"Women often gathered at the bar following meetings at the Gay Activists Alliance Firehouse, a hub for weekly meetings, art instillations and parties.\", \"\\u201cElaine started to throw fund-raisers, and all kinds of fascinating figures started to show up,\\u201d said Andrea Benzacar, an editor and social activist who became friends with Ms. Romagnoli in the late 1980s. \\u201cGloria Steinem was a regular, and Yoko Ono \\u2014 I mean, the list went on and on.\\u201d\", \"At Bonnie & Clyde\\u2019s, the Broadway publicist and producer Irene Gandy said, Ms. Romagnoli \\u201crespected everybody, no matter what color or gender,\\u201d and created \\u201ca safe haven for people who weren\\u2019t out.\\u201d\", \"Tom Duane, the first openly gay member of the New York State Senate, met Ms. Romagnoli through his work with AIDS advocacy organizations and the Anti-Violence Project. He recalled that she often let people hold events and organize in her spaces.\", \"\\u201cShe was way ahead of her time with two things,\\u201d Mr. Duane said in an interview. \\u201cHer establishments welcomed people who were not just cis women, and it was incredibly important to her that women of color were welcome.\\u201d\", \"Bonnie & Clyde\\u2019s closed in the early \\u201980s, but by 1983 Ms. Romagnoli had opened another lesbian bar nearby: the Cubby Hole, a 360-square-foot space on the corner of Hudson and Morton Streets. Storme\\u0301 DeLarverie, a fixture in the gay rights movement who said she threw the first punch at the Stonewall Uprising in 1969, worked as a bouncer there.\", \"As the Cubby Hole became a staple of the local bar scene, Ms. Romagnoli also created some buzzy restaurants. She spent her summers on the North Fork of Long Island and opened a quirkily decorated restaurant, Bonnie\\u2019s by the Bay, in a renovated barn in New Suffolk. It drew glowing reviews.\", \"In 1985 she opened Sunset Strip, a tapas restaurant on Horatio Street in the West Village. Every surface there \\u2014 floors, ceilings, stairs and all the furniture \\u2014 was colorfully painted by the artist Phillip Mayberry and his partner, Scott Walker.\", \"Sunset Strip became a regular hangout for an eclectic crowd. Among its regulars were the novelist Jerzy Kosinski; Holly Woodlawn, the transgender actress known for her work in Andy Warhol\\u2019s movies; and Annie Sprinkle, the porn star turned artist and activist. The club also hosted events like Run-DMC\\u2019s 1986 \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d after-party.\", \"Sunset Strip closed in 1988. Bonnie\\u2019s by the Bay closed in the mid-\\u201990s.\", \"In 1990 Ms. Romagnoli decided to close the Cubby Hole and look for a larger space. The next year she opened a new bar, Crazy Nanny\\u2019s, in a two-story space that had once been a jazz club on Seventh Avenue and Leroy Street, about a block away from where the Cubby Hole had been.\", \"Ms. Romagnoli painted the venue lavender, installed a big video screen and a pool table, and put a bar on each floor. There was dancing upstairs. The online bar guide Club Planet described Crazy Nanny\\u2019s as \\u201ca lesbian fun park.\\u201d\", \"She sold Crazy Nanny\\u2019s in 2004 and retired soon after, but her impact on New York\\u2019s gay nightlife remains. Another lesbian bar, Henrietta Hudson, took over the old Cubby Hole location in 1991 and is still in business today. Three years later, a new bar called Cubbyhole opened on West 12th Street with Ms. Romagnoli\\u2019s blessing. (Cubbyhole and Henrietta Hudson are two of New York\\u2019s last three remaining lesbian bars. Ginger\\u2019s, in Brooklyn, is the third.)\", \"Elaine Ellen Romagnoli was born on April 22, 1942, in Englewood, N.J., and grew up in Palisades Park. Her mother, Claire (Fiorina) Romagnoli, was a homemaker; her father, August, ran a gas station.\", \"Ms. Romagnoli\\u2019s survivors include her sister, Nancy Berkowitz, and her brother, David Romagnoli.\", \"She had a tumultuous family life and decided to move to New York City in the 1960s. She worked in various New York bars, restaurants and cabarets, including the Howard Johnson\\u2019s restaurant in Times Square.\", \"Ms. Romagnoli often hired friends and even customers to work at her bars. \\u201cOne day I was going on about my job and probably having a drink in the middle of the afternoon and she said, \\u2018Come work for me,\\u2019\\u201d said Barbara Hughes, a friend and former employee. \\u201cAnd I said, \\u2018OK.\\u2019 I don\\u2019t know why, but she had this thing about her.\\u201d\", \"Some of Ms. Romagnoli\\u2019s former employees remembered her as an enigmatic and tough boss, but many also remembered her as a magnetic friend and the life of countless parties.\", \"\\u201cThe best thing about her was how she would crack herself up,\\u201d Ms. Benzacar said. \\u201cShe had these set pieces that she would tell, and every time she would break herself up, laughing to the point of tears and choking.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cShe was the person that everybody gravitated toward because you just wanted to be around her and hear her stories,\\u201d she continued. \\u201cShe just had this force field of warmth and generosity and incredible funniness.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"08a5c9b8409c11ec8ed4a90e6fe8440a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"08a5c9b8409c11ec8ed4a90e6fe8440a"}},
