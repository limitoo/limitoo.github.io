Then the island democracy reversed its decision, citing pressure from the International Olympic Committee.\", \"In at first declining, Taiwanese officials had pointed to inconvenient flight schedules and pandemic restrictions. But they are also engaged in a political rivalry with Beijing over the Olympics, embodied in one persistent issue: the name of Taiwan\\u2019s delegation.\", \"Taiwan, a self-ruled island that China claims as its territory, has for decades been compelled to compete in international sports events as \\u201cChinese Taipei\\u201d rather than as Taiwan or under its formal name, Republic of China. The International Olympic Committee\\u2019s rules prohibit delegations from Taiwan from using any symbols suggesting that the island is a sovereign nation.\", \"When Taiwan said on Monday that it had decided to take part in the opening ceremony, officials from the island urged China not to try to use the Games to suppress Taiwan. They did not go into specifics, but some Taiwanese officials worry that Beijing might use the Games to undermine the island\\u2019s status.\", \"The dispute centers on the Chinese rendering of the Taiwanese delegation\\u2019s name, \\u201cChinese Taipei.\\u201d Officially, the delegation\\u2019s Chinese name is Zhonghua Taipei. But officials on the mainland often refer to the Taiwanese delegation as Zhongguo Taipei. Zhongguo is the Chinese name for China; referring to the Taiwanese delegation as such implies that the athletes and the island they represent are part of China.\", \"In 2008, when the Taiwan delegation marched into the National Stadium in Beijing for the Summer Olympics, the event\\u2019s Chinese announcer stuck to the official version of the delegation\\u2019s name. But relations between the two sides have since deteriorated, and concerns have grown that this time, China might use the ceremonies as an opportunity to assert its claim over Taiwan.\", \"On Friday, the delegation that will take part in the he island\\u2019s delegation opening ceremony includes four athletes. They will not get to use the name Taiwan on their national team uniforms, sing their anthem or carry the island\\u2019s flag during the opening ceremony.\", \"\\u201cI actually feel a bit disappointed that I can\\u2019t compete with the name of Taiwan,\\u201d Lin Sin-rong, a luger who is competing in Beijing, said in January. \\u201cWhen it comes to China, I do what I should and keep what I shouldn\\u2019t say in my heart.\\u201d\", \"Ho Ping-jui, a 23-year-old Alpine skier and a first-time Olympian, said he hoped to raise the international visibility of Taiwan, where he grew up.\", \"\\u201cI hope more friends from the world can know Taiwan by seeing me ski,\\u201d Ho, 23, said before heading to Beijing from Taipei last week. \\u201cI always tell people that I\\u2019m from Taiwan when I\\u2019m abroad.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"10f663fa85a411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"10f663fa85a411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
