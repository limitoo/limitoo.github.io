The calculation allows a company to focus on its physical assets in isolation and is often used when trying to access finance.\", \"On top of the funding challenges, Francis said the office market had been affected by the pandemic.\", \"More people were working from home and development costs were rising amid skills shortages and supply chain disruptions, he said.\", \"The combination of these factors, plus rising interest rates, were being felt across the sector.\", \"\\\"There's headwinds everywhere you look at the moment, so I think that will force a few people's hands and I think you will see more stock come to the market.\\\"\", \"Francis said the company was still a great believer in office space, but it made sense to sell this asset to free up cash.\", \"He said there was still demand for offices but what people expected from those spaces was changing.\", \"\\\"I think corporates and employees have this expectation of far more amenity in what they are offered in their working environment.\\\"\", \"This could include access to gym facilities, mental health workers and yoga spaces, he said.\", \"The divestment of the building in central Auckland would require approval from shareholders.\", \"If supported, $20m of the proceeds would go towards paying down debt.\", \"The sale was to \\\"substantial New Zealand private investors\\\" with the settlement date in December 2023.
