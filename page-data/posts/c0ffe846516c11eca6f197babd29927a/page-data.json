It\\u2019s not just another great composer\\u2019s death, but the end of the modern American genre as we have known it for the past 70 years.\", \"The giants of the industry are now all gone: Rodgers and Hammerstein, Jerry Herman, Frank Loesser, Jerome Robbins, Michael Bennett, Bob Fosse, Hal Prince. Their contributions broke many molds and new ground. There hasn\\u2019t been anything of late comparable to their original creations, which pushed the envelope, but were always steeped in the best traditions of the American musical.\", \"Ironically, in spite of his extraordinary reputation, Steve would constantly remind me, \\u201cAnother award and another tribute, but my shows don\\u2019t make money.\\u201d \", \"John BreglioNew YorkThe writer was Mr. Sondheim\\u2019s lawyer and agent for 40 years.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"This is not supposed to happen to a genius that we adore so much!

But it is indisputable that his influence over the cultural landscape during the latter half of the 20th century cannot be overestimated.\", \"Earlier this month I attended the first performance of \\u201cCompany\\u201d since the pandemic. Shortly before the house lights went down, there was a murmur in the already over-energized audience, and I saw Mr. Sondheim take his seat just a couple of rows in front of me. Of course, the audience rose (\\u201cEverybody rise!\\u201d) to give him a thunderous ovation, which was his due. I had heard that he was often the most enthusiastic member of the audience when attending one of his own shows, and I would say this was true on that night.\", \"I am still processing this loss of someone I never met, but whose work has had a huge influence on my life and the way I think about art. It\\u2019s hard to imagine a world without Stephen Sondheim in it, and to realize that we can no longer look forward to his next show.\", \"I guess that I\\u2019m \\u201csorry-grateful.\\u201d Thank you, Mr. Sondheim.\", \"Jeffrey SosnickNew York\", \"To the Editor:\", \"As a journalist and longtime fan of Stephen Sondheim\\u2019s works, I had a crazy idea in 1994: I would start a magazine devoted to his works. I didn\\u2019t need his permission but I wrote him a letter. To my surprise he called me on a Sunday afternoon.

He spots me before I see him. He approaches, carrying a small weathered overnight bag, and sporting his signature lopsided smile. Easy and spirited conversation puts me at ease as I drive him to his suite at the Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas. He tells me he\\u2019s thrilled to have a concert grand piano waiting for him in the suite because he\\u2019s in the midst of some new ideas.\", \"The next evening we are at the Dallas Museum of Art, where he will be performing at a gala fund-raiser for the Dallas Institute of Humanities and Culture. I enter the green room, where he is waiting to be called to the stage.\", \"As he stands, he reminds me of my father, with his slightly bushy eyebrows, his twinkly eyes and dandruff flakes dusting the shoulders of his black jacket.
