We asked the experts.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Check the public health rules</div>\", \"When it comes to organising family or social events, vaccine communication expert Julie Leask said it was important to first check what public health measures were in place.\", \"\\\"So if you're having a gathering at your place, are you going to be allowed to have people who are unvaccinated to your residence?\\\" Professor Leask, a social scientist at the University of Sydney, told Coronacast.\", \"If not, she recommends\\u00a0casually reaching out to everyone ahead of time to ask if they've been vaccinated, noting that there are restrictions in place about who can attend.\", \"\\\"It's reasonable to ask \\u2026 'I'm just checking to see if everyone is vaccinated, because we've got those rules right now',\\\" Professor Leask said.\", \"\\\"If someone is not, let them know: 'While unfortunately it's not possible to catch up in person at the moment, we do look forward to catching up when we can, and let's keep in touch by phone.'\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Acknowledge how you feel</div>\", \"When there are no restrictions in place, it's ultimately about what you (and the people attending your event) feel comfortable with.
