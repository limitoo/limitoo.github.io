Under the terms of a leaked draft agreement, Beijing could be allowed to base warships less than 2000km off Australia's east coast.\", \"Speaking with RNZ, Peters said the development was cause for serious concern.\", \"\\\"What is its purpose? And why is it needed? There is no military threat in the Pacific... so what would be the purpose of a security arrangement?\\\"\", \"Peters said New Zealand, Australia, the United States, and United Kingdom had failed the Pacific for decades and he hoped the chickens were not coming home to roost.\", \"The 'Pacific Reset' - which Peters launched in 2018 - went some way to turning relationships around, but the current government had not kept up the tempo required, he said.\", \"\\\"We needed to intensify our interests.\", \"\\\"There are a lot of excuses that will be given - like the advent of Covid and economic circumstances - but the reality is that... we should have accelerated, not backed off.\\\"\", \"Nanaia Mahuta took over as foreign minister after the 2020 election, and late last year, pledged to build on the 'reset' strategy and shift to a focus on 'resilience'.\", \"Mahuta, however, has yet to visit any Pacific countries, aside from Australia, with Covid-19 hampering travel.
