Lululemon is seeking an injunction against Peloton as well as a jury trial, damages and other monetary relief.\", \"Peloton and Lululemon ended a co-branding relationship this year, a split that Peloton described as amicable, according to court documents. Peloton introduced a new apparel brand in September.\", \"In its suit, Lululemon said that five Peloton-branded women\\u2019s bra and legging products, including the Strappy Bra, the Cadent Laser Dot Bra and the Cadent Laser Dot Legging, \\u201cwere infringing\\u201d on six Lululemon patents.\", \"Lululemon also claimed that a Peloton product labeled One Luxe Tight was an imitation of one of Lululemon\\u2019s best sellers, the Align Pant.
