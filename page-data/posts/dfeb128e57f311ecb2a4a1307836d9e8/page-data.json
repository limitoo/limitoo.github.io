And I think in setting a 85 percent threshold, we've balanced that as far as we're able to,\\\" Paulin said.\", \"Sealord is currently 60 staff short in its processing facilities and 50 short onboard its vessels.\", \"Paulin said with the move to living with the virus in the community Sealord wants to minimise the risk of getting a case in its processing plants.\", \"\\\"China delisted one of our plants as the result of a video audit which was unfortunate in the fact they were using a guideline, which the World Health Organization had put out when New Zealand was operating at level one and there hadn't been the discussion between the two governments around what level one was versus the World Health Organisations management of Covid.\", \"\\\"That said, what we're talking about now, in terms of vaccination isn't directly associated with the rules required to get product into places like China. But really, it respects the fact that you don't want to have Covid in a primary industry manufacturing plant, because it creates all sorts of downsides.\\\"\", \"Paulin said a case in the workforce could affect productivity and could risk the company's reputation amongst export countries.\"]","href_hash":"dfeb128e57f311ecb2a4a1307836d9e8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dfeb128e57f311ecb2a4a1307836d9e8"}},
