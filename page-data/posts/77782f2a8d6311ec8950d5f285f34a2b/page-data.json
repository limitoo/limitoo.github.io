under-reporting deaths of Aboriginal people from coronavirus.\", \"It comes after four reports from Aboriginal families that their loved ones had died from coronavirus\\u00a0but had not immediately been counted in the Territory's formal tally of COVID-19 deaths.\", \"Late last week, Aboriginal-controlled NT health service the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress called for a review into the issue, saying the national definition of a COVID death was not being properly applied to Aboriginal people in the Territory.\", \"Mr Gunner hosed down claims that the reporting had been delayed, or in some cases not added at all, saying he had been reassured by the NT's chief health officers that it was not the case.\", \"\\\"Sometimes, someone passing takes longer to really work through the contributing factors to just really make sure it genuinely is COVID,\\\" Mr Gunner said in a press conference on Monday morning.\", \"\\\"So, I'm confident in talking with Dr [Chief Health Officer Hugh] Heggie \\u2026 it's not about delay of reporting, it's about making sure they handle that death appropriately and respectfully.\", \"\\\"And acknowledge if it is or isn't from COVID, once they're certain.\", \"\\\"What would be worse is saying it's not, then it is, and making mistakes like that.\", \"The\\u00a0number of COVID-19 patients in Northern Territory hospitals was\\u00a0unchanged\\u00a0today at 164, with one in an\\u00a0ICU.\", \"There are now 19 patients needing oxygen.\\u00a0\", \"The Northern Territory government announced 767 new COVID-19\\u00a0cases on Monday, including 10\\u00a0cases that were added to Sunday's total.\", \"Of the new cases, 672 were detected by rapid antigen tests (RATs).\", \"<img

mandate, but many also elect\\u00a0to wear masks outdoors.(ABC News: Che Chorley)</div>\", \"In total,\\u00a0515 new cases have been recorded in the Top End, 100 in Central Australia, 43 in East Arnhem, 23 in the Big Rivers region, 21 in the Barkly region and 55 are still under investigation.\", \"The number of active COVID-19 cases in the NT now stands at 7,229.\", \"Territory-wide, people must wear a face mask while indoors, but the NT government is also encouraging people to wear masks when they can't physically distance while outside.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">International tourists to enter NT with two jabs</div>\", \"Mr Gunner made the comments during a press conference on Monday announcing a $12 million package to help entice international tourists and workers to the Territory once Australia's borders reopen next week.\", \"He said international visitors would likely only need two vaccine jabs for entry into the region.\", \"That would be in contrast to most NT workers, who are mandated to receive three shots.\", \"\\\"When it comes to things like the practical implementation of the vax pass, it's probably going to be extremely difficult to differentiate between a two-dose international visitor and a three-dose local, and I think that's something that every jurisdiction is going to wrestle with,\\\" Mr Gunner said.\", \"\\\"I think all of us are going to end up with a situation where the vax pass is based off two doses.\\\"\", \"He said no final decision had yet been made on the issue.\", \"Mr Gunner also flagged the possibility that NT residents would eventually need to receive a \\\"fourth shot\\\" to be classed as fully vaccinated.\", \"Chair of Tourism NT Michael Bridge welcomed the government's assistance for the pandemic-hobbled industry\\u00a0but noted there were still big challenges ahead.\", \"\\\"We're hopeful in two or three months, we can see the trickling in of international visitors,\\\" he said.\", \"<img
