Any received after that wouldn't be looked at until office workers returned on January 10.\", \"Once approved, payments can take eight working days to appear in midwives' bank accounts, south Auckland-based lead maternity carer Naomi Siddall told Newshub.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's absolutely fine that they close down - that's not the problem. The problem is the notice period they gave us,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"Siddall has been a midwife for eight years, and said normally the ministry gives them a couple of weeks' warning.\", \"\\\"There's no way they didn't know this was coming\\u2026 It made me feel sick. It was [sent with] malicious intent. Very disrespected.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"She said most midwives don't put in claims \\\"10 minutes after each birth\\\".\", \"\\\"It can pile up. A lot of midwives put aside a day for admin... then we know eight working days later we'll get a payment. You build up a couple of weeks' worth of work then put an invoice through.\\\"\", \"The email from the ministry said the \\\"extended close down period may have an impact but trust that this notification will enable you to plan accordingly\\\".\\u00a0\", \"Another midwife who contacted Newshub anonymously said she couldn't believe it was real, calling the lack of notice \\\"thoughtless and cruel\\\".\", \"\\\"While I appreciate the need for all your staff to have well deserved time off over the holidays, the timing of this communication is so appalling and disrespectful that I at first took it as some kind of spam. Merry Christmas indeed.\\\"\", \"Another posted on social media it was \\\"lovely\\\" that ministry office staff get time off over Christmas.\", \"\\\"We would all love two weeks off too, but completely not paying us for what we do for weeks is just crazy.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Newshub contacted the Ministry of Health for a response to the midwives' complaints. A spokesperson said they had \\\"fewer staff on today\\\" and had the 1pm COVID-19 update to prepare, but would look into it.\\u00a0\", \"A Hawke's Bay midwife who didn't want to be named told Newshub midwives are \\\"disgusted and angry\\\" at the sudden deadline, particularly coming after changes to their pay structure which has seen their incomes \\\"drop significantly\\\".\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Can\\u2019t believe it's legal,\\\" she said via email. \\\"We really do need change or I promise midwifery like we know it will be over within 10 years.\\\"\", \"Siddall said she used to take on four new mothers a month - but now needs seven to keep her income where it was.\", \"Stuff reported a group of midwives have drafted a letter to Health Minister Andrew Little about the \\\"disrespect\\\" they're being shown.\\u00a0\", \"The country has a shortage of midwives, particularly in regional areas such as Southland. Analysis by the Ministry of Health in 2018 found they're worth about $241,000 each - about three times more than most are paid.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We're on call 24/7, so we do our births, we do our post-natal visits out in the community - which we were still doing all the way through COVID, going into people's houses,\\\" said Siddall. \\\"Plunket weren't, midwives were. We were the only frontline force other than the EDs and hospitals that were still actively working face-to-face with everybody.\\\"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"346d1d70636b11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"346d1d70636b11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
