From there a referral is completed for the child and wh\\u0101nau to multi-agency teams who agree on an action plan developed by the team within 48 hours.\\\"\", \"More than 200 referrals had been made through what was known as the fast track programme since December 2022, he said.\", \"\\\"Only 23 percent of those referred from the fast track through to the multi-agency teams have been referred again, showing the impact quick support can have on reducing reoffending,\\\" De Wattignar said.\", \"Recently there had been some good examples of the Police's Retail Crime Prevention Programme security interventions helping foil offenders, he said.\", \"One example was when offenders in a stolen car went to rob a shop but only managed to flee with some confectionary after the owner activated a fog canon and emergency alarm, they then tried another store a fog canon was again activated and this time they fled with cigarettes, he said.\", \"\\\"City CCTV then picked up the offenders and Police Eagle staff then used automatic number plate recognition cameras to provide commentary on the getaway vehicle, which was subsequently stopped by Police Dog Units and all four offenders were caught.\\\"\", \"Without the technology and security the offenders would likely have caused more harm and not been caught as quickly, he said.\", \"As at 6 July, a total of 2795 security interventions have been approved for eligible ram raid and aggravated robbery stores and allocated to contractors. Of these, a total of 1987 security interventions such as fog canons, security sirens and CCTV systems have been completed and invoiced by contractors.\"]","href_hash":"0c85cda4214f11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0c85cda4214f11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
