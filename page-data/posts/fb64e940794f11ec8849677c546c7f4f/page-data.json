We need to see where we are and see if there remain opportunities to pursue the diplomacy and pursue the dialogue, which again, as I said, is by far the preferable course,\\\" Blinken said. \\u00a0\", \"He also urged unity on the part of the Ukrainian government, which has been beset by domestic political turmoil even as the threat of Russian aggression mounts. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"Our strength depends on preserving our unity, and that includes unity within Ukraine,\\\" Blinken said. \\\"I think one of Moscow's longstanding goals has been to try to sow divisions between and within countries, and quite simply, we cannot and will not let them do that.\\\" \\u00a0\", \"U.S. officials have issued increasingly urgent warnings about the potential for a Russian invasion in recent days. Last Friday, the Biden administration\\u00a0accused\\u00a0Moscow of prepositioning trained operatives in Ukraine who could carry out \\\"acts of sabotage\\\" against Russian proxy forces to create a pretext for invasion. \\u00a0\", \"Yesterday, a senior State Department official said Russia's recent movement of troops and hardware into neighboring Belarus was \\\"neither an exercise nor normal troop movement,\\\" and could open up another front in a potential invasion. \\u00a0\", \"At a think tank in Moscow on Wednesday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov again denied that the Kremlin had any plans to invade Ukraine. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"I am certain that there is no risk of a large-scale war which might break out in Europe or anywhere else,\\\" he said, Russian state media reported. \\\"We do not intend to take any aggressive actions.
