He was 88.\", \"The cause was cancer, said Sandra Woodhouse, his personal assistant at King\\u2019s College London.\", \"In more than a half-century at what is now the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King\\u2019s College, Dr. Rutter was known for his clinical expertise in treating children with mental health problems, and for his ambitious research. In 1973, he was awarded Britain\\u2019s first professorship in child psychiatry.\", \"\\u201cHe really created modern child psychiatry by insisting on using data to drive thinking about diagnosis and treatment,\\u201d Bennett Leventhal, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, said in a phone interview. \\u201cIf you go back to the 1950s, \\u201960s and \\u201970s, the focus of psychiatry came out of psychoanalysis, which was built largely on case vignettes. That\\u2019s not bad \\u2014 it\\u2019s what we had \\u2014 but Rutter said we can do better.\\u201d\", \"In the 1960s and \\u201970s, Dr. Rutter and his research team conducted what Dr. Leventhal said were the first epidemiological studies in child and adolescent psychiatry. They established that psychiatric problems were fairly common among children on the rural Isle of Wight and an inner borough of London, and that the children\\u2019s feelings of misery and depression affected, among other things, how well or poorly they did in school.\", \"Dr. Rutter also discovered that emotional, behavioral and reading problems were twice as common among the children in London as they were on the Isle of Wight, but that children in both areas were affected by family discord, their parents\\u2019 psychiatric problems and criminality, and overcrowding in their homes.\", \"The studies \\u201cplayed a major role in understanding how biological brain pathology influenced development,\\u201d Dr. Rutter told The Annual Review of Developmental Psychology this year. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not that it had not been thought of before, but it was the first time it had been systematically studied.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Rutter challenged the idea that autism was caused by the impact of distant parents \\u2014 more specifically, so-called refrigerator mothers \\u2014 and the idea that it was a form of schizophrenia.\", \"In a 1977 study, Dr. Rutter and Susan Folstein examined why there was a higher incidence of autism between identical twins, who share the same set of genes, than between fraternal twins, who share half of their genes. They concluded that autism was largely genetic. It was a stunning finding at the time, but it has since been validated in molecular studies.\", \"\\u201cBefore Rutter, the heritability of autism was doubted,\\u201d Manuel Casanova, a professor of biomedical sciences at the University of South Carolina, said in an email. \\u201cRutter brought it to the forefront and implied that it was larger than previously suspected.\\u201d\", \"In 1998, when a paper in the medical journal The Lancet suggested a link between autism and the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, Dr. Rutter set out to disprove its finding. He looked at the incidence of autism in countries that had stopped using the vaccine, particularly Japan.\", \"\\u201cAnd what our findings showed is that the rate continued going on up \\u2014 that the withdrawal of a supposed risk factor had not made a difference, and if anything it had got worse, not better,\\u201d he said in 2008 in an interview for a video project called \\u201cToday\\u2019s Neuroscience, Tomorrow\\u2019s History.\\u201d (The Lancet retracted the paper in 2010.)\", \"Michael Llewellyn Rutter was born on Aug. 15, 1933, in Broumana, Lebanon, near Beirut, where his father, Dr. Llewellyn Rutter, worked at a hospital. His mother, Winifred (Barber) Rutter, was a homemaker.\", \"A few years later, Michael and his family moved to Wolverhampton, in the West Midlands, England, where his father worked as a general practitioner.\", \"But in 1940, his parents, fearful that Germany might invade England, sent Michael and his sister, Priscilla, to the United States, where they lived with separate foster families in the same small town.\", \"\\u201cMy new foster parents were punctilious in not taking over from my parents,\\u201d he told The Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in 2010. After four enjoyable years \\u2014 his sister, in contrast, had a difficult time, especially after being rejected by her first foster family \\u2014 he returned, he said, \\u201cas an ebullient American teenager\\u201d whose grandmother asked his mother, \\u201cDo you think we\\u2019ve got the right ones back?\\u201d\", \"He entered the University of Birmingham Medical School in 1950, planing to be a general practitioner and join his father\\u2019s practice. But he became fascinated by neurology and neurosurgery and then by psychiatry, inspired by a professor, Wilhelm Mayer-Gross, a prominent psychiatrist who had fled Nazi Germany. \", \"Dr. Rutter worked at various British hospitals after graduating from medical school in 1955 and was a pediatrics fellow at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, in the Bronx, from 1961 to 1962. He joined the social psychiatry research unit at Maudsley Hospital in London in 1962, and the Institute of Psychiatry, also in London, in 1966. He was knighted in 1992.\", \"Dr. Rutter wrote or co-wrote more than 400 papers and 40 books, including \\u201cFifteen Thousand Hours: Secondary Schools and Their Effects on Children\\u201d (1979), based on a study of the problems faced by London schoolchildren during 12 years of education.\", \"He also wrote \\u201cMaternal Deprivation Reassessed\\u201d (1972), which suggested that children can develop strong attachments not just to their mothers but also to other people, both inside and outside their families, who will affect heir mental health and development. It was a challenge to the work of John Bowlby, a British psychiatrist whose \\u201cattachment theory\\u201d argued that a mother\\u2019s love is absolutely critical to a child and that its deprivation can have dire results.\", \"Survivors include Dr. Rutter\\u2019s wife, Marjorie (Heys) Rutter, a nurse and the co-author with him of \\u201cDeveloping Minds: Challenge And Continuity Across The Lifespan\\u201d (1993); his daughters, Sheila and Christine; his son, Stephen; his sister, Priscilla, and seven grandchildren.\", \"As increasing numbers of Romanian orphans were adopted by families in Britain in the early 1990s, Dr. Rutter and several colleagues began a long-term study to determine how well the children recovered from the difficult conditions they had experienced in orphanages.\", \"Many of them, he found, adapted quickly to their new homes, but some who were adopted after they were six months old had higher rates of autism spectrum disorder, overactivity and poor personal engagement than a control group of children who had been adopted within Britain. By age 15, some of the Romanian children\\u2019s emotional, conduct, cognitive and social relationship problems could be traced to their early privations.\", \"\\u201cMike interviewed the children himself,\\u201d Dr. Leventhal said. \\u201cHe needed to hear their voices.\\u201d\", \"Edmund Sonuga-Barke, a professor of developmental psychology, psychiatry and neuroscience at King\\u2019s College who collaborated on the study, said it had been Dr. Rutter\\u2019s innovative idea to \\u201cstratify\\u201d the sample of Romanian children into how long each had been in an institution.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s really important if you\\u2019re going to go past a mere correlation to say, \\u2018Yeah, there might be a causal relationship here,\\u2019\\u201d he said in a video made by King\\u2019s College to celebrate Dr. Rutter\\u2019s retirement this year. \\u201cSo you can show what they call in pharmacology the \\u2018dose effect.\\u2019 Is there an effect of the dose of deprivation on young people\\u2019s outcomes?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"1c72abe43fe011ec89358b7b34a1ce58"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1c72abe43fe011ec89358b7b34a1ce58"}},
