foreign workers and students a year into Australia via a private hotel quarantine system with support from the Home Affairs Department.\", \"Quarantine Services Australia (QSA) was officially registered as a company on August 30 by former deputy NSW Liberal Party director Scott Briggs, who is also the president of Scott Morrison's federal electoral conference in his Sydney electorate of Cook.\", \"Two weeks earlier, another company linked to Mr Briggs, DPG Advisory Solutions, was awarded a $79,500 \\\"limited tender\\\" contract by the Home Affairs department to provide \\\"consultancy services\\\" to help develop the proposal.\", \"An \\\"industry update\\\" distributed by QSA this week confirmed\\u00a0\\\"Home Affairs engaged DPG to help facilitate an Industry led and funded quarantine capability in line with Commonwealth Government policy\\\".\", \"\\\"QSA is established as a not-for-profit entity based on the principle of mutuality,\\\" the company's brochure explains.\", \"\\\"QSA [was]\\u00a0established as user funded and operated quarantine service capable of processing up to 80,000 Skilled Labour Immigrants (SLI) a year, together with a similar number of student visa holders, in state government compliant facilities across Australia.\\\"\", \"The company also promises to include \\\"aligning a provisional quarantine place with a Home Affairs travel exemption and assisting in matching air travel\\\".\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/15c0e175a40cf52cf12224e7b8366aa3\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Scott Briggs (left) officially registered QSA as a company in August.(ABC News)</div>\", \"Under current COVID-19 border restrictions, only a limited number of fully vaccinated non-Australian workers can enter the country with a Commonwealth exemption, but in some states international arrivals must still go into quarantine.\\u00a0\", \"QSA is proposing to funnel thousands of future arrivals through a similar privately run scheme that would include \\\"austere, resource industry, facility-style accommodation\\\" through to higher-end \\\"hotel accommodation\\\".\", \"As Australia's travel restrictions are gradually eased, the company's proposal may have become less viable, and it has\\u00a0shifted focus to shorter \\\"catch-and-release\\\" hotel quarantine stints that would involve testing and verifying the vaccine status for foreign arrivals before they can enter the community.\", \"QSA's \\\"indicative pricing\\\" for quarantine support is as high as $12,500 for full 14-day stints, or between $2,700 and $4,700 for shorter three-day \\\"catch and release\\\" places.\", \"During the final post-vaccination phase of the reopening plan endorsed by National Cabinet, Australia's international border will be open, and quarantine limited only to \\\"high-risk inbound travel\\\".\", \"A Department of Home Affairs spokesperson told the ABC:\\u00a0\\\"Facilitating increased traveller movement is crucial to the continued return of Australians from overseas, and our ability to respond to critical labour shortages impacting Australia's economy.\\\"\", \"\\\"DPG was engaged to support the department to facilitate industry discussions on the management of quarantine of skilled workers, agricultural labour, tertiary students and others over time, thereby, helping to reduce the impact on state and territory quarantine capacity.\\\"\", \"DPG Advisory Solutions was founded and run by former Liberal Party candidate David Gazard, who previously worked as a Coalition ministerial adviser and journalist and is also a close confidant\\u00a0of Mr Morrison.\", \"<img

Some are owned and staffed by former Coalition government officials and staffers, while others are linked to the Labor Party. Some even employ a mix of staff with links to both sides of politics.\", \"A Senate committee was told last month that the Department of Home Affairs had met with Mr Briggs and Mr Gazard at least a dozen times over August and September to discuss the QSA proposal.\\u00a0\", \"At present, QSA's only employed officer is David Saul, who used to be the CEO and managing director of Paladin Australia while it provided \\\"garrison services\\\"\\u00a0on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island under a controversial Department of Home Affairs contract.\\u00a0\", \"QSA has also engaged Canberra-based health company Aspen Medical, which has already received over $1 billion in COVID-19 pandemic-related contracts from the federal government, to oversee the quarantine and testing arrangements in its proposal.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">PM's office says it is not involved</div>\", \"Shadow Home Affairs Minister Kristina Keneally described the QSA venture as a \\\"money-for-mates\\\" proposition full of conflicts of interests.\", \"Mr Morrison's office insists the Prime Minister is not involved with the QSA proposal, which is being handled entirely by the Department of Home Affairs.\", \"\\\"The Prime Minister has had no involvement in the engagement of anyone involved in developing this proposal and the proposal is being handled entirely by the Department of Home Affairs,'' a spokesman for Mr Morrison said.\", \"The ABC has approached Quarantine Services Australia for comment, but the company is yet to respond.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0c419c6d9f219bc98fedd61769f82d91\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> An information sheet issued by Quarantine Services Australia.(Supplied)</div>\"]","href_hash":"af68ee6941cc11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"af68ee6941cc11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
