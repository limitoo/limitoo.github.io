Vaccines help prevent infection and are highly effective at preventing severe COVID-related illness.\", \"But vaccines are not 100 percent effective at stopping people from getting COVID. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges that COVID breakthrough cases are expected, and that people who do experience a breakthrough case may spread COVID to other people.\", \"However, fully-vaccinated people with a COVID breakthrough case are less likely to develop serious illness than an unvaccinated person.\", \"People may notice that as the pandemic progresses, breakthrough cases of COVID become more common.\", \"Breakthrough COVID cases are also linked to suggestions that vaccine protection wanes over time. One study, published in the journal Nature on November 4, looked at the Pfizer vaccine and found that the risk of a breakthrough infection appeared to be higher in people who were vaccinated early than those who were vaccinated later.\", \"However, the study results were preliminary and the reduction in effectiveness was observed against the Delta variant, and not other types of COVID.\", \"The authors said future studies should look at different strains, as well as evaluating the protective effect of booster dose.\", \"According to the CDC, 58.9 percent of the total U.S. population had been fully vaccinated as of November 16, amounting to a total of 195.4 million people.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1934360/derek-hough.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Derek Hough at the Variety and Women In Film's 2017 pre-Emmy celebration on September 15, 2017 in West Hollywood, California.
