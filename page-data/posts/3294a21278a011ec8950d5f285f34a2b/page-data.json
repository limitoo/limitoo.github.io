The number of new property listings is trending higher. And as the market fails to absorb new listings the total available supply for sale has begun rising off record low levels.\\\"\", \"Despite the latest figures pointing to the slowdown, Couchman ruled out a major housing market correction, instead forecasting the market would consolidate.\", \"\\\"Looking at the past 30 years, meaningful corrections typically occur when credit conditions tighten rapidly and we have an unemployment rate rising fast.\", \"\\\"We certainly have tightening credit conditions and rising mortgage rates. Yet we see the labour market as a source of strength for households, not weakness.\\\"\", \"ASB Bank said the latest REINZ report \\\"effectively confirmed\\\" the housing boom was over.\", \"Senior economist Mike Jones said the data validated forecasts of a sharp pull-back in housing demand in response to higher interest rates and tighter lending standards.\", \"\\\"We suspect housing activity might recover a little in coming months, so we're not getting too carried away with the December decline.
