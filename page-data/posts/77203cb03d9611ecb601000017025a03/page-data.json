An unsmiling woman with a hard, monumental profile stands alone next to a truck. People mill around nearby, murmuring indistinctly. Abruptly, the woman ducks under some police tape and into the truck, where she hastily begins unzipping one white body bag after another and just as quickly scanning their contents, her nose wrinkling at the exposed bundles of tattered clothing, remnants of missing persons. She\\u2019s soon ejected by a worker, but her search continues.\", \"The woman, Fahrije (Yllka Gashi), is looking for her husband, one of the missing, who disappeared years ago during the Kosovo War. Now, with her two children and a disabled father-in-law, she struggles to keep the family going. She labors with the beehives that her husband once managed, selling jars of honey at a local market. Sales are modest and sometimes close to nonexistent, but the bees are her only means of scraping together a meager living. Every so often, she meets up with a women\\u2019s collective whose members face the same hurdles under the unhelpful watch of the town\\u2019s men. And she keeps looking for her husband \\u2014 a haunting, troubling phantom.\", \"A liberation story told with easy naturalism and broad political strokes, \\u201cHive\\u201d tracks Fahrije on her path to independence. (It\\u2019s based on the experiences of an Albanian Kosovo woman of the same name.) Like its protagonist, the movie is stern, direct and attentive to ordinary life. The writer-director Blerta Basholli doesn\\u2019t bludgeon you with the character\\u2019s miseries, or hold your emotions hostage. Fahrije isn\\u2019t lovable; sometimes she\\u2019s scarcely likable, which means she\\u2019s more of a human being than an emblem of virtuous suffering. She has her charms, though these tend to emerge in the intimacies she shares with her family and female friends like Naza (a piquant Kumrije Hoxha).\", \"With her husband presumably dead but with no corpse in the graveyard, Fahrije is stuck in a cruel limbo, an uncertain status shared by others in the collective. Prevailing norms mean that these women aren\\u2019t allowed to remarry, and they\\u2019re not allowed to do much of anything else, other than care for their families, socialize with other presumptive widows and display subservience to men. Even Fahrije\\u2019s more seemingly innocuous efforts to support her family \\u2014 selling her husband\\u2019s old table saw, for one \\u2014 are treated like scandalous affronts to him, their life and their world. She\\u2019s shamed at home and in public, harassed and demoralized, simply for stepping into the role of provider.\", \"Basholli doesn\\u2019t revisit the Kosovo War in documentary detail or dig into its geopolitical backdrop; she also doesn\\u2019t illuminate the cultural and social practices that so harshly circumscribe the lives of these widows. She isn\\u2019t interested in partisan politics, nor is she waving any obvious flags. Instead she concentrates on the textures, gestures and practices of everyday life, lingering over how Fahrije tends the hives, tries to fix a leaking faucet, bathes her son, feeds her family and painstakingly processes ajvar, a hot pepper sauce that she cooks, bottles and hopes to sell. Yet in focusing on this one woman, Basholli is making an argument about what types of war stories are worth telling.\", \"There\\u2019s little doubt where Fahrije is headed, and the movie sometimes tries a bit too strenuously to brighten her difficult journey. Even so, \\u201cHive\\u201d seizes and holds your interest simply through the drama created by sympathetic characters trying to surmount awful, unfair hurdles. Mostly, though, what holds you rapt is Gashi\\u2019s powerful, physically grounded performance, which lyrically articulates her taciturn character\\u2019s inner workings. Together, the performer and her director reveal the arc of a life through Fahrije\\u2019s gestures and in the hard lines of her jaw, in her unsmiling lips and in her quickly lowered gaze. And while the character\\u2019s stoicism seems like an unbreachable wall, these two women dismantle \\u2014 and rebuild it \\u2014 to stirring effect.\"]","href_hash":"77203cb03d9611ecb601000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"77203cb03d9611ecb601000017025a03"}},
