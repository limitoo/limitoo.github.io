There was a lot of frustration over the condition of the road, so it is likely the railways installed this path to make access easier between the shed and the wharf,\\\" McLean said.\", \"\\\"The asphalt laid in the 1970s, at the time the Cumberland Street overbridge was built, has done a good job preserving the surface.
