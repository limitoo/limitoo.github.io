But there were some confused pilots and air traffic controllers.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Is it a security-related issue, or do we know anything?\\\" a pilot in San Diego asked, according to air traffic control audio obtained by CBS News.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I honestly have been given no information at this time,\\\" an air traffic controller responded. \\\"I've just been given information that we are in a ground stop.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"The North Korean launch was immediately detected by satellites. Within minutes, the North American Air Defense Command inside Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado had determined it was not a threat to the U.S. The missile traveled 400 miles in what North Korea claimed was a test of a hypersonic missile.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It doesn't have anything like the range that would be necessary to reach the United States. It frankly couldn't even reach Japan,\\\" the Middlebury Institute's Jeffrey Lewis told CBS News.\\u00a0\", \"North Korean tests are always cause for concern, but until now they have not been cause for grounding airliners.
