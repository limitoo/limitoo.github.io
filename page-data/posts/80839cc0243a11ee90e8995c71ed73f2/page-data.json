Protest organiser and Waiheke Local Board acting chairperson Bianca Ranson said the regular price increases were taking a huge toll on the community.\", \"\\\"It's our main lifeline to Auckland,\\\" she told Morning Report.\", \"She said hundreds of residents used the service every day and prices had skyrocketed during the past year.\", \"\\\"As a community we're clearly fed up, we're frustrated.\\\"\", \"Ranson said the protests could continue.\", \"\\\"Our last option is to protest, and that will be an ongoing protest, there's more coming.\\\"\", \"Many Waiheke residents use monthly or flexi passes, which make their fares substantially cheaper. But Ranson said those discounted fares were still unaffordable and overpriced.\", \"\\\"Our priority is definitely for residents ... but also families that visit us,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"If we've got fares that are $59 per person return, and we've got family that need to come over to the island, or people that are needing to go to the city for hospital appointments ... it's crippling.\\\"\", \"Ranson said the fares had been steadily increasing for some time.\", \"\\\"The increases in ferry fares have been really consistent over recent years and it's really highlighted the need for regulation of the Fullers ferry service,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"It's out of control.
