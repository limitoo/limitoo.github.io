It was SpaceX's second launch this year for the state-owned T\\u00fcrksat Satellite Communications and Cable TV Operations Co.\", \"Over the next few weeks, on-board thrusters will put the satellite into a circular orbit 22,300 miles above the equator to provide civil and military data relay, TV and broadband services.\", \"With Saturday's launches behind them, and two successful booster recoveries, SpaceX engineers will ready another Falcon 9 for a Tuesday launch from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, kicking off an automated rendezvous with the International Space Station.\", \"The launch will be SpaceX's 24th station resupply flight and the company's 31st overall flight this year, believed to be a record for a U.S. company launching payloads to orbit on a commercial basis.\", \"Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News. He covered 129 space shuttle missions, every interplanetary flight since Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune and scores of commercial and military launches. Based at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Harwood is a devoted amateur astronomer and co-author of \\\"Comm Check: The Final Flight of Shuttle Columbia.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"83e1371c608f11ec8452f3274d0260a5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"83e1371c608f11ec8452f3274d0260a5"}},
