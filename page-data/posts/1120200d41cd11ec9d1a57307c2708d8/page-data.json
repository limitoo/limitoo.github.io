The architect James Biber, who designed the original restaurant with its signature parachute light fixtures, was on the job again, this time introducing a somewhat more subdued palette with splashes of color from the art on the walls (all for sale). There is new lighting, by David Weeks, the owner of David Weeks Studio in Brooklyn, that soars across the room in a series of stretched pale fabric wings. There\\u2019s a bright little lounge area up front. Bret Csencsitz, Gotham Bar & Grill\\u2019s former manager, and his business partner, Kevin Conrad, an environmentalist, bought the restaurant after it closed during the pandemic, and took on the reboot. Sensitive to Gotham Bar & Grill\\u2019s long tradition \\u2014 it first opened in 1984 \\u2014 Mr. Csencsitz named Ron Paprocki, its pastry chef of 10 years, to be the executive chef. His menu, unquestionably American and seasonal, relies on ingredients like Elysian Fields lamb, heritage pork and heirloom carrots, with inventive accompaniments. \\u201cThe sauces are the game-changers for me; they\\u2019re French at the heart,\\u201d Mr. Paprocki said. \", \"The options range from rare to well at Laurent Tourondel\\u2019s new steak restaurant, down the block from his restaurant L\\u2019Amico. Wagyu skirt steak is the only cut on the menu; it comes with sauce, unlimited fries and market greens, $28. Seasonal vegetables and rich desserts, like coconut cake from a cart, are extra. A cauliflower steak and a burger at lunch are off-menu options. The room is simple, done in light wood just this side of unfinished with a big central bar. Tables seat parties of two to four, though larger parties can also be accommodated. \", \"A long-awaited reopening is ready now, with some changes. The chef Daniel Rose, in partnership with the restaurateur Stephen Starr, has added a new menu, \\u201cA Very Coucou Dinner,\\u201d with four courses for $185. The chef de cuisine, Justin Bogle, is back, but the pastry chef, Mark Henning, who was at Clocktower, is new to the restaurant. \", \"Jeremy Salamon, who was the executive chef at The Eddy and Wallflower, is paying homage to his 94-year-old grandmother, Agi Salamon, and to his Hungarian heritage with this new restaurant and pastry shop that looks to Eastern Europe. It will open serving breakfast and lunch, and offer dinner after the holidays. Leberk\\u00e4se p\\u00e2t\\u00e9 in a sandwich, dumplings and egg noodles in chicken broth and sweets like Hungarian palacsinta pancakes and Sacher torte are a few of his menu items. \", \"This 30-year-old sandwich shop with several outlets in Florence, Rome and Milan, Italy, came to New York in the summer of 2019 for a monthlong pop-up at Otto Enoteca e Pizzeria. The lines were long. Now, it will settle into a more permanent, roomier home in the theater district in a partnership between Tanya Bastianich Manuali, Joseph Bastianich and the owner of the Italian company, Tommy Mazzanti. There are nine sandwiches, most of them involving Italian cured pork and creamy cheeses. \", \"On Saturday and Sunday, Eric Huang, who has received plaudits for his fried chicken dinners, for which there is a long waiting list and a password required, will set up shop at Temperance, a wine bar in the West Village. His food will be served Saturday and Sunday. Chile fried chicken drumsticks, salt and pepper duck drumettes, butter bean salad, and kabocha squash with onions and bacon are some of the items on the menu. Takeout will not be available. \", \"The choices at this seasonal American restaurant in the Arlo SoHo in Hudson Square include many seafood starters. Generally, though, the menu leans toward comfort, with pizzas, a burger and a half chicken on offer. The executive chef is Carsten Johannsen. (Opens Wednesday) \", \"With the chef Nicholas Poulmentis, the restaurateur Andreas Koutsoudakis has turned his Tribeca\\u2019s Kitchen into this outpost for the specialties of Crete. Seared snails with peppers and onions and smoked pork with caramelized onions are some of them. Black truffle tarama comes from the chef\\u2019s own playbook. \", \"What began as a pop-up one year ago will now replace the Manzo restaurant for the long term. Its focus is on Milan with dishes like the classic saffron risotto, osso buco and veal cutlet Milanese. Negronis are featured and the wines all come from small producers within 100 miles of Milan.\", \"Peter Philis, whose great-grandfather founded Lexington Candy Shop in 1925, has teamed up with another restaurant industry veteran, Paul Modica, to open this neighborhood-style spot where easygoing American fare rules. \", \"A brick-walled tearoom, owned by Ali Saboor and Nasim Alikhani, serves sweets like traditional cupcakes, rose-scented doughnuts and rice puddings. It\\u2019s a spinoff from Sofreh, a Persian restaurant in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, which Ms. Alikhani owns with Theodore Petroulas. The cafe also offers a few savory pastries. \", \"The Bedford, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has now set up a back-room pizzeria for Neapolitan-style pies. (Wednesday) \", \"City public high school students specializing in culinary studies from Food & Finance High School in Hell\\u2019s Kitchen have opened an empanada stand at Brooklyn Market in Barclays Center. It\\u2019s open during Nets home games and some special events, though the menu will rotate throughout the season. \", \"The ambitious plans for a food hall Anthony Bourdain hoped to install on Pier 57 on the Hudson River before he died in 2018 have been revived \\u2014 somewhat. Instead of a two-story collection of global street food vendors, it will now be limited to Unesco-recognized Singapore hawker food stalls, 18 of them, and in Midtown, not on the pier. For the reconfigured project, KF Seetoh, a Singaporean who, with his wife, Patricia, founded Makansutra, an organization to preserve hawker food, and the World Street Food Congress and who had been advising Mr. Bourdain, has teamed up with Eldon Scott. (Mr. Scott, the president of UrbanSpace, a company that runs permanent and seasonal indoor and outdoor markets in several cities, including New York, was set to run Mr. Bourdain\\u2019s market.) Speaking by phone in Singapore where they were tasting and fine-tuning the list of participants for the market, Mr. Seetoh and Mr. Scott said the market would open in the first quarter of next year in a broad, covered passageway that runs from 50th to 51st Street, midblock between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. Mr. Scott said that a market selling street foods like chile crabs, Hainanese chicken rice, and Southern Chinese fish ball mee pok tah noodles in Midtown should appeal to office workers, tourists and theater-goers, pointing out that in Singapore such markets thrive in all sorts of neighborhoods.\", \"After five years at John Doherty\\u2019s Black Barn restaurant in NoMad, most recently as executive sous-chef, Mr. Fowler has been promoted to be executive chef.\", \"Mr. Gross, who was at the Saranac Waterfront Lodge in the Adirondacks, is the new executive chef at The Standard, East Village.\", \"Ms. Kramer, the former sous-chef at the newly reopened Il Fiorista in NoMad, has been promoted to be the restaurant\\u2019s executive chef. The spot specializes in flowers in its food and boutique, and Ms. Kramer is ramping up her use of floral accents in dishes like farm beans with flowering broccolini, and tagliatelle with spaghetti squash and nasturtium. \", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
