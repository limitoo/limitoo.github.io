For the final leg at Madison Square Garden over the weekend, which coincided with Halloween, they pulled out the stops. Mr. Styles, who has been hailed, aptly or not, as a David Bowie for a new generation, urged fans to arrive in fancy dress. Fair to say, they understood the assignment, wearing some semblance of the star\\u2019s signature boa feathers and froth. The costume extravaganza, billed as Harryween, was a hybrid celebration of the pop prince\\u2019s florid gender-free style and of a traditional Allhallows Eve \\u2014 a veritable fashion parade that rivaled cosplay conventions and the most fanciful runway shows.\", \"Age: 25\", \"Occupation: mental health therapist\", \"Home: West Virginia\", \"Are you part of a fruit bowl?\", \"Yes, I\\u2019m a strawberry. I\\u2019m here with my fianc\\u00e9. He\\u2019s a banana. My costume is from a website called Dolls Kill.\", \"And that schoolgirl beret?\", \"That\\u2019s mine. I thought it would be cute, like a strawberry top.\", \"Your bag is an imitation watermelon wedge. What\\u2019s that about?\", \"Harry sings a lot about strawberries and watermelons, like in his song \\u201cWatermelon Sugar.\\u201d\", \"What do those lyrics say to you?\", \"Hmm, how do I put this? I think they\\u2019re about pleasuring a woman.\", \"Age: 22\", \"Occupation: video marketer\", \"Home: Chicago\", \"You make a fetching milkmaid.\", \"Actually, this costume is inspired by the movie \\u201cMidsommar.\\u201d It\\u2019s the female lead right after she becomes May Queen. I\\u2019ve always wanted to do this get-up and figured this would be the perfect time to show it off.\", \"Did you pluck your rose crown from a garden?\", \"I made it. The flowers are from Goodwill. I took a wire hanger, made a circle, wrapped it in stuffing, cut up the flowers and glued them on. I made most of my costume out of the sheet from a bed, and cut out some stencils to decorate it\", \"What do you make of this preconcert fashion parade?\", \"It\\u2019s an amazing communal experience. Everyone here is at the top of their game and on your same wavelength. You can talk to anyone in line and make a new friend.\", \"Age: 28\", \"Occupation: lawyer\", \"Home: San Juan, P.R.\", \"Tell us about that shirt-slash-blouse you have on.\", \"It\\u2019s from a Puerto Rican designer, Herman Nadal. It\\u2019s kind of an interpretation of Harry\\u2019s aesthetic, but the designer is local, very Caribbean, very fun.\", \"What does the look say about Harry Styles?\", \"Harry is very out there. He\\u2019s the face of Gucci.\", \"Does that make him authentic?\", \"I like to think he has some say in what he gets to wear. He\\u2019s a creative artist who dresses as a form of self-expression. He\\u2019s a little bit Gucci, a little himself. But he\\u2019s genuine.\", \"Age: 22\", \"Occupation: substitute teacher\", \"Home: New York City\", \"Even in this crowd, your green hair is a beacon.\", \"I\\u2019m an Oompa Loompa.\", \"Down to the trousers, it seems.\", \"These pants came as part of another costume. I cut them short, tied suspenders to the back and pinned them in front.\", \"The collar makes a statement, too.\", \"That\\u2019s what they wear at the chocolate factory.\", \"Age: 22\", \"Occupation: accountant\", \"Home: New York City\", \"Are your red coat and goggles upmarket cosplay?\", \"I just thought, Harry\\u2019s very over-the-top and camp, so why not also be camp and mimic his vibe.\", \"What makes him worthy?\", \"He\\u2019s real, one of the most genuine artists working today. He knows how to connect. That\\u2019s what he\\u2019s done with so many people here.\", \"Age: 18\", \"Occupation: marketing student at the Fashion Institute of Technology\", \"Home: New York City\", \"You look like a bride from a fantasy Western.\", \"That was the idea. Originally, we were going to order like these big robes with boas on them from Amazon. But that didn\\u2019t work out. So I was kind of like, Let\\u2019s just be brides. Let\\u2019s wear these sparkly cowboy hats with veils. The hats are the foundation of our look.\", \"Age: 18\", \"Occupation: Student\", \"Home: New York City\", \"You\\u2019re sprawled on the pavement making a poster. What will it say?\", \"Our friend Caroline came as a lobster. So the message will read, \\u201cHave you ever seen a lobster dance?\\u201d I feel that\\u2019s something Harry would respond to.\", \"And if he does?\", \"Maybe he\\u2019ll dance with her.\", \"Age: 22\", \"Occupation: software engineer\", \"Home: Torrance, Calif.\", \"You look like a pair of mermaids. Was that the point?\", \"No, I wanted a \\u201cMamma Mia!\\u201d moment with my mama. But Mom did the full-body jumpsuit, and I did the skimpy one. Who says software engineers can\\u2019t have fun?\", \"Age: 55\", \"Occupation: homemaker\", \"Home: Torrance, Calif.\", \"That\\u2019s a come-hither costume. What was the source?\", \"It\\u2019s a jumpsuit from the internet. We wanted to do a mother-daughter look. The inspiration started with Harry. But it\\u2019s also \\u201cMamma Mia!\\u201d\", \"Age: 50\", \"Occupation: manager, complaints department, Kentucky Postal Service\", \"Home: Louisville, Ky.\", \"Your headpiece is a statement. Does it have a name?\", \"This was a fascinator I\\u2019ve worn before. I added roses to make it fuller and matched it with this little floral dress that I\\u2019m wearing over a turtleneck.\", \"Do I see a theme here?\", \"It\\u2019s kind of a cross pollination between Harry and Hollywood. We felt like a lot of people would have Halloween themes. We wanted to go out of the box a little.\", \"Age: 50\", \"Occupation: executive at Konica Minolta U.S.A.\", \"Home: Louisville, Ky.\", \"You two are expertly coordinated.\", \"I take pride in my style, in trying to keep up with the times.\", \"But your hat seems to be a throwback.\", \"The top hat is a staple of the Day of the Dead. We don\\u2019t believe in getting costumes at a costume shop. We went to Goodwill, bought some flowers at Michael\\u2019s and just kind of flung it all together. Two hours ago, we were throwing makeup on. We had no idea what we were doing.\", \"Age: 25\", \"Occupation: artist\", \"Home: Ann Arbor, Mich.\", \"Looks like you put a lot of work into your look.\", \"It\\u2019s from Amazon.\", \"I didn\\u2019t know Amazon offered anything so regal.\", \"It\\u2019s inspired by the \\u201920s. I\\u2019m a huge fan of the \\u201920s. I love the style, the architecture and the fashion.\", \"Is there an obscure Styles connection?\", \"His music video \\u201cTreat People with Kindness\\u201d has a lot of 1920s references. I just thought I\\u2019d like to go with that.\", \"Will we return in spirit to the Roaring Twenties?\", \"Only in the sense that once this pandemic subsides, we will all be able to celebrate, to interact again.\"]","href_hash":"a4ebd4923b7511ecbcfe000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a4ebd4923b7511ecbcfe000017025a03"}},
