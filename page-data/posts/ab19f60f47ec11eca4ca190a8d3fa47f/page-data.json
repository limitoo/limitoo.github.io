This new contract offer keeps an immediate 10 percent raise the previous deal offered. It also makes changes to the details of Deere's internal incentive pay program for workers that the United Auto Workers union said was \\\"modest.\\\"\", \"Deere officials said not to expect the company to offer any more money to the union after the last vote on November 2. Deere has mostly stuck to that promise in this new proposal.\", \"Along with the initial raises, the offer keeps the 5 percent raises that were in the third and fifth years of the six-year deal and 3 percent lump-sum payments in the second, fourth, and sixth years of the deal. The proposal also has an $8,500 ratification bonus, gives a pension option for new employees, makes workers eligible for health insurance faster and keeps their no-premium health insurance coverage.\", \"The contract covers 12 plants, seven in Iowa, four in Illinois, and one in Kansas where the company's equipment is made. This is the first major strike at the company since 1986.\", \"The company is calling this its final offer. What it did was slightly change the formula it uses to decide which workers get bonuses depending on if their teams hit certain productivity goals. The changes could allow workers to qualify for incentive pay easier. However, there are some Deere workers who can't qualify because of the job they do in the company's factories and warehouses.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1934881/john-deere-strike-contract-vote.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Over 10,000 Deere and Co. workers are voting on a contract offer Wednesday that has \\\"modest\\\" changes from the last rejected offer. Above, members of the United Auto Workers strike outside of a John Deere plant, October 20, 2021, in Ankeny, Iowa. </div>\", \"The workers who went on strike on October 14 have been holding out for more from Deere, which has predicted it will report record annual profits between $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion when it releases its earnings report later this month. Initially, more than 90 percent of the workers rejected Deere's initial offer, but the second vote was much closer after the company essentially doubled the raises it was offering.\", \"Deere workers have had to endure increasingly colder temperatures along the picket lines while trying to get by on the union's $275 in weekly strike pay or by finding another job.\", \"Company officials have said they are using salaried employees and other workers to try and keep their factories operating during the strike. Other Deere plants globally are also working to pick up work.\", \"Still, Deere workers\\u2014and other unions\\u2014have been emboldened to ask for more this year because of the ongoing worker shortages and because workers didn't always feel appreciated while working long hours during the pandemic.\", \"Another group of UAW-represented workers went on strike earlier this year at a Volvo Trucks plant in Virginia and secured better pay and lower-cost health benefits after rejecting three tentative contract offers. Currently, about 1,400 Kellogg's workers have been on strike since early last month at the company's four U.S. cereal plants.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1934886/john-deere-strike-contract-vote.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Over 10,000 workers are voting on a new contract offer Wednesday that has \\\"modest\\\" changes from the last rejected offer.
