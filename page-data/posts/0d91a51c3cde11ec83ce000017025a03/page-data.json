A brief video clip of a coach punching a horse at the Tokyo Olympics may alter it forever.\", \"After more than a century of having its participants compete by running, shooting, fencing, swimming and riding, the venerable Olympic sport of modern pentathlon is set to drop equestrian jumping from the event, according to multiple news media accounts, led by the website Inside the Games. The decision came after two members of Germany\\u2019s Olympic team were accused of mistreating a horse at the Tokyo Games.\", \"An announcement of the change will be made on Thursday, the international federation said. Several news reports said competitors would continue to ride in the event \\u2014 by trading horses for bicycles \\u2014 but the organization made a point of disputing that.\", \"\\u201cWe are not able to confirm nor deny whether riding will be removed from modern pentathlon or not,\\u201d the federation, the International Modern Pentathlon Union, said Wednesday. But it moved to rebut news media reports about a possible substitute for riding, saying, \\u201cIt is untrue to say it will be replaced by cycling.\\u201d\", \"Any change would probably take effect for the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\", \"An incident involving the mistreatment of a horse at the 2020 Tokyo Games cast an unwelcome spotlight on the sport. Unlike in the standard equestrian competitions at the Olympics, competitors in modern pentathlon are randomly assigned horses for riding rather than providing their own. Sometimes those horses perform flawlessly. Other times they do not.\", \"In Tokyo, that led to accusations of abuse after a German pentathlete and medal contender, Annika Schleu, was assigned a stubborn horse that refused to jump at all. Her coach Kim Raisner was captured on video punching the horse while Schleu tried to get it to continue, and Schleu was accused of whipping it excessively. Schleu denied the charge, but Raisner was sent home from the Games.\", \"But that incident, and the death of a horse injured in a different event at the Tokyo Games, led animal rights activists to call on the International Olympic Committee to remove equestrian sports from the Olympic program altogether.\", \"Changing one-fifth of a sport like modern pentathlon, though, would have a significant effect on athletes who have trained in the traditional disciplines for years.\", \"\\u201cIf it changed to cycling, I wouldn\\u2019t be in the sport,\\u201d the reigning men\\u2019s gold medalist, Joe Choong of Britain, told Sportsmail. \\u201cIt would not suit me at all. I am sure a lot of athletes would feel the same.\\u201d\", \"But Greg Whyte, another British Olympian, told The Guardian: \\u201cI don\\u2019t think it is necessarily a bad thing. All sports evolve, and no sport is immune from change in the modern TV era.\\u201d\", \"One might say the modern pentathlon is neither modern, nor a pentathlon. Although it joined the Olympic program in 1912, it is called \\u201cmodern\\u201d to contrast it to the ancient Greek pentathlon, which included wrestling, running, javelin, discus and long jump. The current disciplines were said to have been chosen to represent the skills required of a military cavalry officer.\", \"There have been several efforts to, well, modernize the modern pentathlon in recent years, as the sport, generally near the bottom of Olympic popularity rankings, has fought to stay relevant. Notably, running and shooting were combined into one event in 2012, making the pentathlon more of a quadrathlon.\", \"Once a five-day event, modern pentathlon was reduced to a single day in 1996, and plans are underway to conclude the whole competition in a rapid-fire 90 minutes at the Paris Summer Games in 2024.\", \"These changes came in part because as the Games add sports with youth appeal, some creaky events like modern pentathlon might begin to seem irrelevant. The sport\\u2019s Olympics place has seemed threatened on several occasions.\", \"A quaint element of modern pentathlon is that it comes with a story: Envision a soldier trapped behind enemy lines. He might ride a horse, fight with sword and pistol, run and swim to reach safety. The pentathlon simulates this little tale in an athletic setting.\", \"Perhaps that story will have to change.\"]","href_hash":"0d91a51c3cde11ec83ce000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0d91a51c3cde11ec83ce000017025a03"}},
