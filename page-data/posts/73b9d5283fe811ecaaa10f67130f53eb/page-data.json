We picked up an hour of morning sun when Daylight Saving Time came to an end overnight in the United States, and now it\\u2019s autumn for real. Time to rake leaves and trim hedges, if you live that sort of life; to store your air-conditioner for the winter; to haul out your sweaters; to set up the Thanksgiving group chat to see who has a new dietary restriction or to determine who\\u2019s bringing what to dinner. (First time doing that? We\\u2019re here to help.) I\\u2019m setting up for 20-plus guests this year, if negative testing allows it. Marked on my to-do list for today: \\u201cRent folding tables and chairs?\\u201d\", \"Also on today\\u2019s docket, unrelated to Thanksgiving: lamb meatballs with spiced tomato sauce (above), one of my favorite Sunday suppers. I like it with warm pita and, lately, yogurt thinned out with orange juice and flecked with mint. (A number of subscribers serve the dish with orzo, which seems a nice touch.)\", \"On Monday, I\\u2019d like to go orzo for sure, in the form of this chickpea stew with orzo and mustard greens.\", \"For Tuesday night, how about pasta with tuna, capers and scallions? It\\u2019s stellar with supermarket canned tuna, but if you can find a jar of the oil-packed fish from the Mediterranean? Oh, man. That\\u2019s a luxurious feed.\", \"By Wednesday I\\u2019ll be dragging, especially if I double up the cooking on Monday or Tuesday to knock out some Thanksgiving pies for the freezer. For the midweek meal, I\\u2019m thinking ease of preparation along with deliciousness. That\\u2019s three-cup chicken, absolutely.\", \"I like this slow-cooker curried sweet potato soup with coconut and kale for Thursday night, rich and comforting, peanut buttery in all the best ways.\", \"And then on Friday, I\\u2019ll head into the weekend with this awesome cornbread tamale pie, a keystone recipe from \\u201cJoy of Cooking,\\u201d which the ace cook and reporter Jennifer Steinhauer brought to The Times in 2006 on the occasion of the cookbook\\u2019s 75th birthday.\", \"We have thousands and thousands more recipes to cook this week waiting for you on New York Times Cooking. To answer a question I get a lot: Yes, you do need a subscription to access them. Subscriptions are the fuel in our stoves. They allow our work to continue. I hope, if you haven\\u2019t already, that you will subscribe today. Thanks.\", \"Visit us on YouTube while you\\u2019re at it. (Why here\\u2019s Melissa Clark now, demonstrating how to make an apple pie for your holiday feast!) Check us out on Instagram, too. And do get in touch with us directly, if you run into trouble along the way, either in your kitchen or on our site and apps. We\\u2019re at cookingcare@nytimes.com. Someone will get back to you. (You can also write to me. I accept cheers and jeers alike: foodeditor@nytimes.com. I read every letter sent.)\", \"Now, it\\u2019s precious little to do with half-sour pickles or the smell of fresh bread, but I\\u2019ve been spending a lot of time lately with The Louvre Art Deck, which is a set of 100 cards depicting great works in the Louvre\\u2019s collection. Pick one at random and stare at it for a while. Note what you find. Research the rest. I do that a few times a week, like a bargain-basement Simon Schama, and it\\u2019s as enjoyable as any pursuit available in the metaverse.\", \"Wow, for $185 you can put on a safety harness and climb the outside of the observation deck at 30 Hudson Yards in New York?\", \"Enter the wayback machine that is the Stacks Reader: Here\\u2019s Nelson George on Marvin Gaye, May, 1984, in The Village Voice.\", \"Finally, there\\u2019s a new piece of poetry from Maureen N. McLane in the London Review of Books, \\u201cWeeds.\\u201d Read that, cook well and I\\u2019ll be back on Monday.\"]","href_hash":"73b9d5283fe811ecaaa10f67130f53eb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"73b9d5283fe811ecaaa10f67130f53eb"}},
