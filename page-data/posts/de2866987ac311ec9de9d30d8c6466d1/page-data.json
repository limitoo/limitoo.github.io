It’s one of several high-tech British projects pushing dramatic boundaries.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-01-21T06:11:27.000Z","content":"[\"LONDON \\u2014 Standing in front of a golden bandstand, dressed in a white satin gown and pearls, the vocalist Nubiya Brandon sashayed to a gentle beat. Stepping toward the spotlight, she took a lazy turn around the stage, singing a playful calypso number and smiling occasionally at the band behind.\", \"The weird thing about this show, called \\u201cAll Kinds of Limbo,\\u201d was that Brandon appeared to be in this reporter\\u2019s kitchen. The singer was in fact an eerily realistic holographic avatar on a mobile phone screen; her performance had been recorded and was now being broadcast in augmented reality from the National Theater in London.\", \"Via the technology\\u2019s strange alchemy, which overlays digital imagery onto whatever a camera phone is pointing at, Brandon seemed to be singing and sashaying on the countertop. After she took a bow, her image evaporated and the bandstand faded into nothingness, leaving only a sink full of washing up behind.\", \"The success of digital-only theater productions has been one of the pandemic\\u2019s surprise silver linings: Audiences have been willing to try them and theater companies have found fans thousands of miles away. But could immersive technologies provide a more intriguing path forward for drama, one that will endure once Covid-19 (hopefully) subsides? Augmented reality (A.R.) and virtual reality (V.R.) are already changing gaming, music and art; might theater be next?\", \"\\u201cAll Kinds of Limbo\\u2019s\\u201d director, Toby Coffey, said he hopes so. In 2016, he set up the National Theater\\u2019s Immersive Storytelling Studio, which operates as a kind of \\u201cstart-up\\u201d within the company, he said in a recent interview at the studio\\u2019s modest space, which was crowded with a jumble of technical equipment. The team\\u2019s brief is to see how live theater and new technologies can interact and intersect.\", \"\\u201cTheater makers are naturally fascinated: They\\u2019re used to working in 3-D,\\u201d Coffey said. \\u201cAs soon as you bring a director or stage designer or choreographer into V.R., you see their brains whirring.\\u201d\", \"The studio\\u2019s first production, \\u201cFabulous Wonder.land,\\u201d was a V.R. music video featuring a track by the musician Damon Albarn with words by the playwright Moira Buffini. The team has since made 360-degree films of live shows, developed a one-on-one piece in which an audience member interacts with a live actor while wearing a V.R. headset and created a mixed-reality \\u201cexhibition\\u201d about government welfare cuts.\", \"\\u201cAll Kinds of Limbo\\u201d came into being in 2019 after the National Theater had a hit with \\u201cSmall Island,\\u201d a play about postwar Jamaican immigration to Britain. Coffey and his team commissioned Brandon, the vocalist, and the composer Raffy Bushman to create a 10-minute song sequence responding freely to the play\\u2019s themes. It was written, performed and motion-captured that year, and was initially presented as a V.R. experience in one of the theater\\u2019s event spaces.\", \"When the pandemic shut down British performing venues in March 2020, Coffey accelerated plans to turn \\u201cAll Kinds of Limbo\\u201d into an at-home experience. The retooled version can be watched via A.R. on a mobile device, via a V.R. headset, or on a regular computer. Brandon\\u2019s performance stays the same, but, depending on the device used, the experience feels subtly different.\", \"To summon some of theater\\u2019s shared intimacy, it\\u2019s being ticketed and broadcast as live, although the show is recorded. Other people attending virtually are represented by blades of moving white light and, by playing with the settings, you can move around the space and see the action from different angles.\", \"It\\u2019s a short piece, but \\u201cAll Kinds of Limbo\\u201d does feel like the glimmering of a new art form: somewhere between music video, video game and live cabaret show.\", \"Over the last few years, Britain\\u2019s theater scene has become a test bed for similar experiments. Last spring, the Royal Shakespeare Company co-produced an immersive digital piece called \\u201cDream\\u201d that featured actors performing using motion-capture technology and was watchable via smartphone or computer. Other projects, such as shows by the Almeida theater in London and the company Dreamthinkspeak in Brighton, England, require participants to turn up in person and get equipped with VR headsets.\", \"Francesca Panetta, a V.R. producer and artist who was recently appointed as the alternate realities curator at the Sheffield DocFest film festival, said in a video interview that practitioners from audio, gaming, theater, TV and other art forms were collaborating as never before. \\u201cMany different people are trying to explore this space and work out what it really is,\\u201d she said. \\u201cNo one is quite sure.\\u201d\", \"One of the most keenly awaited partnerships is between the immersive theater troupe Punchdrunk, which pioneered live site-specific shows such as \\u201cSleep No More\\u201d and \\u201cThe Masque of the Red Death\\u201d in the mid-2000s, and the tech firm Niantic, best-known for the wildly successful A.R. game Pok\\u00e9mon Go.\", \"Speaking by phone, Punchdrunk\\u2019s co-founder Felix Barrett seemed invigorated by the creative possibilities. \\u201cWe\\u2019re on the cusp of a new form of entertainment,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a new genre; it just hasn\\u2019t been named yet.\\u201d\", \"Later this year, Niantic and Punchdrunk plan to unveil the first results of their collaboration. Barrett was reluctant to reveal too much, but said that it would offer participants \\u201ca citywide adventure\\u201d that will feel like an immersive video game happening in the real world. \\u201cOur goal is to try and make you the hero of your own living movie,\\u201d he said.\", \"Ambitious as such projects are, they are also \\u2014 at least by theater standards \\u2014 time-consuming and forbiddingly expensive. The Royal Shakespeare Company\\u2019s \\u201cDream\\u201d wouldn\\u2019t have been possible without corporate sponsorship and a hefty grant from a roughly $55-million British government fund promoting digital arts innovation. The latest iteration of \\u201cAll Kinds of Limbo\\u201d relies on a partnership with Microsoft and the livestreaming platform Dice.\", \"There\\u2019s also the question of audience. Though theater-led projects such as \\u201cDream\\u201d and \\u201cAll Kinds of Limbo\\u201d have gained positive reviews, they have attracted only a tiny fraction of the 12 million viewers who watched a 2020 virtual performance by the rapper Travis Scott in the online game Fortnite. The chances of monetization at scale look slim, at least for now.\", \"And the irony is that, while the pandemic may have whetted audience appetites for digital drama, it has had devastating consequences for theater companies themselves. The National Theater\\u2019s Immersive Storytelling Studio originally had four staff members; after belt-tightening layoffs in the company, it\\u2019s now just Coffey and one full-time co-worker. \\u201cEven before the pandemic, we could have been doing 10 times more than we had resource to be able to do,\\u201d Coffey said. \\u201cWe need to work within those restrictions.\\u201d\", \"What happens next is up for debate. The National Theater is working on redeploying the app and distribution platform used for \\u201cAll Kinds of Limbo\\u201d into something that works for other projects. Panetta said that the metaverse, if it genuinely takes off, offers its own possibilities for live performance. \\u201cIt\\u2019s difficult to see what the pathway is; I suspect it\\u2019ll be a mix of many different things,\\u201d she added.\", \"So how long until we\\u2019re watching Ibsen or Shakespeare in augmented reality at our kitchen tables? Coffey laughed, then cautioned that designing successful A.R. performances was still an emerging skill. \\u201cBut some day it\\u2019ll happen, I have no doubt,\\u201d he added.\"]","href_hash":"de2866987ac311ec9de9d30d8c6466d1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"de2866987ac311ec9de9d30d8c6466d1"}},
