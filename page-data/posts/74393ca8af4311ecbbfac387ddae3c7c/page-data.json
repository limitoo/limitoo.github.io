What happens here is our local fire brigade will deliver water that's not suitable for drinking but for toilets and stuff like that, that comes out of one of the local streams, out of the spring, and they've been flat tack delivering water.\\\"\", \"It had been hard on commercial business, especially those who had to convince visitors used to living on a regular supply to conserve water, he said.\", \"Across the Foveaux Strait, the \\u014creti River remained the sole water supply for roughly 50,000 Invercargill residents as well as businesses and industry.\", \"The Invercargill City Council has already banned unattended hosing and sprinklers - the first stage of water restrictions - for the first time since 2018.\", \"Its Three Waters Strategic Advisor Alister Murray said the restrictions were triggered once the river flow fell to or below certain levels as part of its permit to draw water - and they were approaching the second stage.\", \"\\\"Then we have to ban all outside domestic use, which means you can't wash your car or even hold on to the hose. It's all banned.\", \"\\\"These restrictions have been put in place to protect the \\u014creti River.\\\"\", \"Work was underway to source an alternative supply so they were not left high and dry in an emergency.\", \"\\\"We are vulnerable by only having one source.

We try to catch and release virtually everything so we don't want fish dying on us.\\\"\", \"The lower river flow meant it was easier to find trout, he said.\", \"\\\"The one good thing out of it is that the low levels has opened up a lot of fishing areas that you can't normally wade to.
