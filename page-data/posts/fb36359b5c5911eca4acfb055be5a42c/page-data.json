I want to be very careful what I say here, I guess. I rather thought that the people of North Island had done a really good job. You know, that the majority of us - by far the majority of us of all ethnicities, have gone out and got that stuff pumped into us. And you can hear from my voice that I'm not a huge fan of vaccination, but I've had it done.\", \"\\\"But it's not so much for ourselves. It's for the people around us, and in particular those that are not vaccinated. So to sort of continue with restrictions on that basis for me is a bitter pill to swallow.\\\"\", \"The decision of those who chose not to be vaccinated should be respected.\", \"\\\"I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I understand that not everybody wants to be vaccinated but same time we have not done enough? Can we not just please get on with things? You can hear the frustration in my voice I guess, but (staying in the red setting is) just not what we needed at this time of the year, that's for sure.\\\"\", \"He asked that people still come to Northland over summer.\", \"\\\"All I can say is please, Aucklanders, don't write us off.
