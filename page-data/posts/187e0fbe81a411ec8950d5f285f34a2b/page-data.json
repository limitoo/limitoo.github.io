That included an article from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with the headline \\u201cAmerican CDC Strongly Recommends Russia Invade Ukraine.\\u201d\", \"Thompson wondered if this was true, and Johnson warily answered, \\u201cFor a few months in 2020 \\u2014 the science was changing so fast.\\u201d\", \"The team looked at a series of pro-Russian takes on popular American memes, including The Most Interesting Man in the World (with the caption \\u201cI don\\u2019t always get invaded, but when I do, I prefer Russia\\u201d) and Crying Michael Jordan (\\u201cWhy I gotta be Ukrainian when Russia two feet away\\u201d).\", \"There was also a TikTok dance video that met with Johnson\\u2019s disapproval. \\u201cThe choreography wasn\\u2019t even crisp,\\u201d he complained. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to log into my finsta and flame those guys in the comments.\\u201d\", \"The team reviewed other video, including a sendup of a series of State Farm advertisements with Pete Davidson playing what the group thought was an impersonator of Aaron Rodgers, the Green Bay Packers quarterback. Thompson clarified: \\u201cApparently that is the real Aaron Rodgers,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI guess he left the Packers to play for Russia.\\u201d\", \"Chloe Fineman, playing a vicious high-school junior who has newly been named secretary of defense, looked over America\\u2019s own unimpressive efforts at social-media response, including an Evil Kermit meme that a horrified Thompson described as \\u201ccheugy.\\u201d\", \"Johnson wondered if the situation called for a different approach. \\u201cLet\\u2019s just do something fun and simple that everyone can get behind,\\u201d he said. \\u201cLike a drone strike.\\u201d\", \"You knew Willem Dafoe could act. (Heck, if you stuck around for a strange \\u201cBeauty and the Beast\\u201d parody near the end of the show, you got to see him dance rather nimbly.) But if your wish was that \\u201cS.N.L.\\u201d would get him to sing, it was granted in this filmed segment, in which Thompson, Nwodim and Chris Redd contribute verses to a Weeknd-esque pop tune about the problems that wake them up at night, like loud Spotify commercials and a spouse\\u2019s sharp toenails.\", \"Dafoe turns up as the co-host of a TV infomercial for an air fryer, who eventually starts to sing. Let\\u2019s just say he has the voice of an angel who has also played an unraveling old salt in \\u201cThe Lighthouse.\\u201d\", \"This being a family newspaper, there isn\\u2019t too much specific detail we can recount here about this fake advertisement: It features Mikey Day, who is increasingly appalled by his interactions with the retired baseball star Frank Thomas (Thompson), the former football player Doug Flutie (Kyle Mooney) and Dafoe as himself, all trying in the bluntest language possible to sell him on a \\u201ctestosterone-boosting male enhancement\\u201d called Nugenix.\", \"But boy does Dafoe commit to the bit, even when the sketch requires that he fall to his knees, writhe in pain and utter phrases like, \\u201cYour perfume smells lovely, m\\u2019lady.\\u201d\", \"Over at the Weekend Update desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine and the impending retirement of Justice Stephen G. Breyer from the Supreme Court.\", \"Jost began:\", \"He continued:\", \"Che pivoted to Breyer\\u2019s retirement:\", \"We\\u2019re not going to lie: It had been a bit of an up-and-down show up to this point, so who\\u2019s better qualified to deliver a much-needed win than Peyton Manning?\", \"Manning, the former Super Bowl M.V.P. (and \\u201cS.N.L.\\u201d host) was ostensibly at the Weekend Update desk to talk about the thrilling results of last week\\u2019s N.F.L. playoff games. \\u201cI heard they were incredible,\\u201d Manning said, adding: \\u201cSounds like all the teams did a great job. Lots of passing and, uh, all the touchdowns were in the end zone.\\u201d\", \"Turns out, however, that he had missed the games so he could watch Season 2 of \\u201cEmily in Paris,\\u201d a show that Manning praised for its \\u201cromance, adventure, sensuality, culture, a fresh take on feminism \\u2014 finally \\u2014 not to mention a culinary tapestry so rich I can only describe it as food porn.\\u201d In Manning\\u2019s own words, we\\u2019ll just add: sacr\\u00e9 bleu.\"]","href_hash":"187e0fbe81a411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"187e0fbe81a411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
