It also\\u00a0reported 30,062 new infections, near-record levels.\", \"The second-largest state, Victoria, which hosts the Australian Open tennis tournament this month, reported 44,155 new COVID-19 cases and four deaths.\", \"Australia reported just under 100,000 cases overall, down from a record 116,025 the previous day, but still surpassing most previous peaks.

Most states said they would begin the new school year as scheduled at the end of January but Queensland, the third most populous state, said it would postpone the return to school by two weeks to give children time to be vaccinated.\", \"Despite the outbreak, political leaders have cited Australia's high vaccination rate - more than 90 percent of people over 16 are fully vaccinated - to justify a reopening plan. But several states in recent days have postponed non-urgent elective surgery to clear hospital beds for COVID-19 patients and reintroduced mask mandates.\", \"NSW, which emerged from more than 100 days of lockdown late last year, has reinstated a ban on dancing and drinking while standing up in bars.\"]","href_hash":"3b894698717a11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3b894698717a11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
