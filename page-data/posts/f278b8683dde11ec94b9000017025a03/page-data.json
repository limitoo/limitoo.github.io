And Democrats are freaking out after looking at the results.","country":"au","create_time":"2021-11-05T02:20:45.000Z","content":"[\"This week there was a big election in America.\", \"One candidate fixated on Donald Trump the entire campaign. In his final pitch to voters, he said Trump's name 13 times in a 15-minute speech.\", \"The other candidate barely mentioned the former president during the campaign, and stuck ruthlessly to the issues. In his final pitch to voters, he didn't say Trump's name in his 22-minute speech.\", \"The parties are left out, because if you've been following US politics of late you'd probably have guessed that it was the Republican who hitched their wagon to Donald Trump, while the Democrat steered away.\", \"But that's not the case. And it's Republican Glenn Youngkin who won the race for Virginia Governor on Tuesday local time, setting off a bomb in US politics.\", \"Youngkin is a wealthy businessman, who as a first-time candidate walked a very thin line during the campaign.\", \"While he was endorsed by Trump, and reportedly spoke with him regularly on the phone, Youngkin never hitched his wagon to the former president or even campaigned with him. The most Trump got involved was with a single late phone rally that was closed to the press and the public.\", \"Some commentators have already dubbed it the \\\"Trump in the Spirit over Trump in the Flesh\\\" approach.\", \"Youngkin instead campaigned on education, taxes, abortion \\u2014 bread and butter Republican issues.\", \"And he beat his Democratic opponent, former governor Terry McAuliffe, by a close but comfortable margin.\", \"As McAuliffe tried at every opportunity to tie Youngkin to Trump, he watched his lead in the polls slip away in the closing days and then lost the only poll that matters in the end \\u2014 the election.\", \"As you can imagine, Democrats are freaking out right now.\", \"Virginia is a state US President Joe Biden won by more than 10 per cent over Trump in 2020. Where he increased the Democratic vote by more than 4 per cent since 2016. Biden, Vice-President Kamala Harris and former president Barack Obama all hit the stump \\u2014 hard \\u2014 for McAuliffe.\", \"Democrats are rightly worried about just who voted for Youngkin \\u2014 it's the same voters that moved away from Trump in 2020 and put Biden in the White House. Like a tasting platter at a big department store deli, they took a little nibble of voting for Democrats, but didn't show any willingness to actually buy the cocktail weenie.\", \"What Youngkin did was show Republicans across America how they can win at the 2022 midterms and take control of the House and Senate.\", \"And he showed Democrats that a strategy they were banking on \\u2014 raising the spectre of the former president \\u2014 doesn't work outside of their traditional havens like California when Trump's not actually on the ballot or in the news all the time.\", \"What's behind the shellacking? Take your pick.\", \"Likely candidates include\\u00a0Biden's messy withdrawal from Afghanistan; the coronavirus coming back to disrupt normal life again; the President's persistent lagging approval rating; trying to make an election about Trump when he's not on the ballot; and Democrats being seemingly unable to pass spending bills in Congress because of intra-party issues.\", \"It's also worth noting that Virginia voters have traditionally given the incumbent president a clip around the ears when it comes to the Governor's race.\", \"But that's no panacea to Democrats. Because voters have traditionally done exactly the same thing in midterm elections. With a 50-50 Senate and a 221-213 majority in the House, Democrats don't have room for the Virginia result to be replicated across the country.\", \"Republicans, already eyeing off the Senate and the House, are thrilled with the results and are already measuring up the windows for new curtains in the offices of Speaker and Majority Leader.\", \"So what next?\", \"Well on the federal stage, Democrats are already rounding on their colleague, Senator Joe Manchin, for the role he's played in delaying passing a massive spending bill that has sat on the negotiating table for months.\", \"Biden, who predicted a Democratic victory before election day, certainly acknowledged that the sluggish pace on Capitol Hill wasn't helping his party.\", \"\\\"I'm continuing to push very hard for the Democratic Party to move along and pass my infrastructure bill and my Build Back Better Bill. Look, think about what we're talking about here. People are upset and uncertain about a lot of things, from COVID to school to jobs to a whole range of things and the cost of a gallon of gasoline,\\\" he said when asked about the loss.\", \"\\\"I'm in a position where you're going to see a lot of those things ameliorated quickly and swiftly.
