Today, that symbol represents something more. Today, more people can see themselves in the most powerful superhero in comics.\\\"\", \"In an interview with IGN last month, Taylor added that he's previously had queer characters and storylines rejected within the industry, making him feel like he was \\\"letting down people I loved.\\\"\", \"\\\"When I was asked if I wanted to write a new Superman with a new #1 for the DC Universe, I knew replacing Clark with another straight white savior could be a real opportunity missed,\\\" he added.\", \"DC Chief Creative Officer and Publisher Jim Lee also stated that the latest revelation for Superman shows that the hero can continue to explore his identity within the context of the modern world.\", \"\\\"We talk a lot about the power of the DC Multiverse in our storytelling and this is another incredible example. We can have Jon Kent exploring his identity in the comics as well as Jon Kent learning the secrets of his family on TV on Superman & Lois. They coexist in their own worlds and times, and our fans get to enjoy both simultaneously,\\\" Lee said in a statement.\", \"However, some critics have been less enthused over Superman's newfound sexuality.\", \"Actor Dean Cain, who played Superman in the 1990s hit ABC series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, said last month that he doesn't believe the new decision is \\\"bold or brave.\\\" \", \"\\\"They [DC Comics] said it's a bold new direction. I say they're bandwagoning,\\\" he told Fox & Friends. \\\"If they had done this 20 years ago, perhaps that would be bold or brave,\\\" he added.\", \"Nonetheless, Superman is not the first hero to join the LGBTQIA+ community and will likely not be the last. Others who have recently come out as queer include the new Captain America, Batman's sidekick Robin, Loki, and Captain Marvel.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1924866/superman-bisexual-threats.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Police are reportedly patrolling the homes of some DC Comics illustrators after they received threats from angry fans over the announcement that Superman is bisexual.
