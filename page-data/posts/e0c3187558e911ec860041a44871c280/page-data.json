To this ever-urgent question, \\u201cBeijing Spring\\u201d \\u2014 a new documentary about the titular movement for democratic expression that exploded in the wake of the Cultural Revolution in China \\u2014 responds with a resounding yes.\", \"Directed by Andy Cohen with Gaylen Ross, the film focuses on the Stars Art Group, a collective of self-taught practitioners who seized on the tumult after Mao Zedong\\u2019s death in 1976 and deployed their art like Molotov cocktails. They circulated their paintings and literature via underground magazines; papered revolutionary poems and calligraphy on the famed Democracy Wall; and, most notably, mounted a show on the exterior of the National Art Museum of China after being denied permission to exhibit within.\", \"Rousing if somewhat schematic, \\u201cBeijing Spring\\u201d unfolds as a kind of art-history lesson: In interviews, the Stars look back wistfully on their work, which married ravenous experimentation \\u2014 including abstract styles and nude figures violently forbidden under Mao \\u2014 with strident political critique. Wang Keping\\u2019s sculpture \\u201cIdol\\u201d uses some canny detailing to turn a likeness of Mao into that of the Buddha, quietly excoriating the leader\\u2019s deification.\", \"But the most stirring parts of \\u201cBeijing Spring\\u201d showcase the power of the cinematic arts. The film weaves in long-unseen footage of the artists\\u2019 demonstrations that thrums with both history and stunning aesthetic beauty. Perched on a fence while dodging the police, the young cameraman, Chi Xiaoning, captured the thronging crowds with startling, intuitive immediacy.\", \"Cohen and Ross\\u2019s own filmmaking suffers in comparison to the crafts on display within the film: \\u201cBeijing Spring\\u201d assembles its materials into a by-the-book progression of archival excerpts and talking-head commentary, serving best as a primer on \\u2014 rather than an embodiment of \\u2014 the radical possibilities of artistic form.\"]","href_hash":"e0c3187558e911ec860041a44871c280"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e0c3187558e911ec860041a44871c280"}},
