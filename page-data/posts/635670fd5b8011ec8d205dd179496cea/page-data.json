people in the community, as appropriate, but giving them clear boundaries within that, is really important,\\\" Dr Mundy said.\", \"\\\"So, allow your teenager to have those opportunities, to have

the best thing a parent can do when things go wrong is to see it as a learning opportunity and support their child through it.\", \"\\\"Their brains are still developing, particularly the prefrontal cortex, so they are actually making decisions in a different way to how we as adults do, so they won't always approach the decision-making process in the same way that we will,\\\" Dr Mundy said.\", \"\\\"As long as you have clear boundaries that you've made, together, and they understand why those are in place, have a conversation about what happened and why it went wrong and what decisions they might have made differently in another situation, so they start to build that ability to make sensible, risk-based decisions.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Building community through
