People want to get back to normal.\\\"\", \"Johnson has faced criticism for his handling of the pandemic overall, and Britain has reported 152,872 deaths, the seventh highest total globally. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have followed their own anti-coronavirus measures, generally with tougher restrictions, but have also begun to ease them.\", \"Johnson hopes to reset his agenda following furore over the lockdown gatherings at his office, which has some in his party plotting to remove him.\", \"The lifting of Plan B measures, along with the navigation of Omicron without resorting to a stringent lockdown, could help Johnson appease vocal opponents of restrictions in his own caucus amid the party unrest.\", \"Johnson said if data supported it, he may end the legal requirement for people to self-isolate if they test positive before the regulation lapses in March.\", \"\\\"But to make that possible, we must all remain cautious during these last weeks of winter,\\\" he said, warning of continued pressure on hospitals.\", \"\\\"The pandemic is not over.\\\"\", \"Susan Hopkins, the Chief Medical Adviser to the UK Health Security Agency, said she expected cases would continue to fall, but it would not be linear.\", \"\\\"We believe that overall, we will continue to see declines in cases. That may plateau at some points as the infection is in various different populations,\\\" she said at a news conference.\", \"\\\"People's behaviour and how they react to the removal of Plan B will determine how fast infection can spread in the population.\\\"\", \"Reuters\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"b01a03a8795411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b01a03a8795411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
