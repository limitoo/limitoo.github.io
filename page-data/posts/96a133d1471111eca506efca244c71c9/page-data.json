The victim suffered multiple cuts to the sides and back of his head, and a large section of his scalp was missing.\", \"McGee, who was allegedly in the apartment covered in blood, reportedly told police he went there because his nightmares told him he needed to kill the victim.\", \"According to an FBI agent, McGee told authorities he hit the victim with his fists and a tire thumper.\", \"McGee reportedly found the man on Grindr and used the screen name \\\"st8 curious\\\" before exchanging messages on Snapchat.
