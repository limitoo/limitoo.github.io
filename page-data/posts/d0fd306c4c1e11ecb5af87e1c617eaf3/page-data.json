A friend of the sophomore posted to social media that the abuse had been reported to the school administration, but instead of reprimanding the freshman, the sophomore was given three days' suspension for falsely accusing the freshman, The Associated Press reported.\", \"Students of Little Elm High school walked out of their classes in protest around 10:20 a.m Friday. Junior Kailey Heaton said the protest became violent when police officers tried to gather students by linking arms. The officers tried to push them back but students broke through, Heaton said.\", \"Officers were shown arresting a student while holding him on the ground in videos shared on social media, the AP reported. Other videos show two officers pepper-spraying, then tasing a student.\", \"The school's investigation found little evidence to support the claim, according to a statement from Little Elm Mayor Curtis Cornelius and Little Elm Superintendent Daniel Gallagher. Gallagher further denied the sophomore received any disciplinary actions for reporting the sexual harassment.\", \"On Friday, in a statement on Facebook following the protest, the school said the allegation had \\\"inaccurate information regarding an incident that happened a month ago.\\\"\", \"\\\"This morning, students at Little Elm HS had planned a student demonstration inside the campus that caused some students to behave in a way that caused a major disruption,\\\" the statement said. \\\"Four juvenile students were arrested for assaulting Little Elm Police officers.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938322/little-elm-high-school-protest-sexual-allegations.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A protest was sparked at Little Elm High School after a sophomore accused a freshman of sexually harassing and abusing her.
