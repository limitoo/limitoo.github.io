This is Megan Gray from the front and I want to let you know that I quit and I'm done with this company. Please actually respect your employees and care about our safety for once, and I hope you have a good night,\\\" she said across the store.\", \"The mom captioned the clip: \\\"If only I had quit Mormonism like my daughter quit Target,\\\" and added: \\\"When your daughter quits Target in an epic way,\\\" on screen.\", \"According to comments left by Gray's mom, a customer and employees cheered after the announcement played.\", \"The video can also be seen in full here.\", \"Responses to the video ranged from former employees who claimed to feel similarly about Target from their experiences, to other employees who defended their time at the store, claiming they had good experiences as an employee.\", \"Gray's intercom resignation is the latest from a Target employee to quit in this way. Ten days ago, former employee Edwin Pos went viral on TikTok after recording his similar resignation speech through the speakers.\", \"\\\"I'm quitting this whole a** job,\\\" he said. He went on to identify various co-workers and explain his issues with them in an expletive-filled rant, including referring to one woman as \\\"that Karen-ass Lucifer Linda.\\\"\", \"The employee also took aim at the store's stock problems and mannequins, ending the rant by saying: \\\"F**k management. I quit, now go write an email about that, b***h.\\\"\", \"The videos come as the U.S. (and especially the retail industry) faces a national labor shortage with employees across the country quitting at high rates.\", \"According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, August this year saw a record amount of workers quitting, with over 4.3 million Americans deciding to leave their jobs.\", \"Of those, 730,000 were retail workers and September, the latest data available, saw another 685,000 retail workers quitting.\", \"In contrast to the videos however, Target has reportedly seen very different quit rates than national statistics. Instead, Target's 2021 turnover rate was actually lower than 2019.\", \"\\\"Turnover is down significantly relative to 2019. So we feel really good about where our store is at. And as turnover decreases, you get so many benefits, we get team members that know their job. We get team members that know their guests that are in their stores because they are in their weekly. They can engage with them,\\\" noted John Mulligan, Target's Chief Operating Officer during the company's recent earnings call, as per Fox Business.\", \"It's thought the lack of quitting Target employees on a large scale could be to the company's $15 minimum wage, along with upping flexibility and training employees in different roles.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1940767/target-store-front-logo.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The sign of a Target store is displayed August 14, 2003 in Springfield, VA.
