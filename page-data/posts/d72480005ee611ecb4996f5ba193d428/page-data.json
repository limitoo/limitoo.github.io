He's really experienced and has a lot of advice for the younger boys.\", \"\\\"He's been around and done a lot in the game. It's a blessing for all the young boys to be able to learn off him and get better.\\\"\", \"Meanwhile, 20-year-old Berry has his sights locked on securing his place as a Warriors first team regular, eyeing a spot in the centres by the time the 2022 season rolls around.\", \"In 2021, the Warriors fielded Peta Hiku and Euan Aitken as their first choice centre pairing, but enter 2022 with the possibility of two spots up for grabs.\", \"Hiku has left the club and signed for North Queensland Cowboys, while Aitken turned out to be a perfect fit in the Warriors' back row towards the end of 2021, and could continue as a forward when the new season begins.\", \"For a youngster like Berry, that uncertainty serves as an opportunity to establish himself as a first grade starter for the NRL's only Kiwi club.\", \"And after injuries restricted Berry to just eight NRL appearances this year, the Warriors' pre-season is helping him put the wheels in motion to stay fit and firing for 2022.\", \"The only real question that remains is whether it will be Berry, or another emerging talent that takes hold of the available centre spots over the coming months.\", \"\\\"Obviously, I was injured a lot this year. So off the field I want to get all those pre-hab type things right, getting my body [ready],\\\" he adds.\", \"\\\"On the field, I really want to push for that starting centre spot, get a bit more involved in games kind of things as well.\", \"\\\"There's a lot of young outside backs, there's an opportunity up for grabs for a few of us.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"There's a lot of competition I guess, and we're all going hard together. It's something we've just got to work hard [for] in pre-season, keep trying to get better, and hopefully come round one, someone will put their hand up and take the spot.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"d72480005ee611ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d72480005ee611ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
