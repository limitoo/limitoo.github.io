There are 276 House seats that Biden won by less than that \\u2014 far more than Republicans have held in nearly a century. (As of now, Democrats hold a narrow 221-213 majority.)\", \"But there was also an undisputed truth undergirding McCarthy\\u2019s braggadocio: Democratic support has plunged nationally in recent months. The party\\u2019s loss in Virginia was just the most consequential example.\", \"Exactly how far and fast Democratic popularity has fallen is hotly debated in both parties.\", \"Virginia was one key data point: The election showed a Republican improvement of 12 percentage points, from Biden\\u2019s win in the state a year ago by 10 points to Democrats\\u2019 loss of the governorship this month by two points. The governor\\u2019s race in New Jersey swung toward Republicans by a similar margin.\", \"Still, few strategists, Democrat or Republican, believe the Democratic brand\\u2019s collapse nationally has been quite that complete and widespread.\", \"Among campaign insiders, one popular measurement that is closely tracked to gauge the mood of the electorate is the \\u201cgeneric ballot test.\\u201d That is when pollsters ask voters whom they would prefer to serve in Congress \\u2014 a Democrat or a Republican, with no names attached.\", \"For years, Democrats continuously have held an edge in this metric.\", \"Until now.\", \"For the first time since January 2016, Republicans are now preferred, according to the FiveThirtyEight public polling average. FiveThirtyEight\\u2019s average has swung 4.6 points in the last six months toward the G.O.P.\", \"Just how bad is it out there for the Democrats? A Washington Post/ABC News poll last weekend showed Republicans in the strongest position on this measure in the poll\\u2019s four-decade history. On Thursday, a poll from Quinnipiac University of registered voters said 46 percent wanted G.O.P. control of the House, compared with 41 percent for Democrats.\", \"The same trend is showing up in private surveys. The National Republican Congressional Committee\\u2019s internal polling this month showed that Republicans in battleground districts had improved by seven percentage points since the beginning of the year. So-called generic Republicans began the year three points behind Democrats; now they are ahead by four points.\", \"The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\\u2019s generic ballot testing this month also shows Democrats trailing \\u2014 albeit by two points. Party officials said that actually was an improvement from some other recent months. The D.C.C.C. declined to say what its polling showed at the start of the year.\", \"Representative Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who is chairman of the House Republican campaign arm, said in an interview that the N.R.C.C.\\u2019s private polling at the start of the year measured Biden\\u2019s approval rating as 10 percentage points higher than his disapproval rating. Now, Emmer said, it\\u2019s the reverse: Biden\\u2019s disapproval is 10 points higher.\", \"Emmer offered a less hyperbolic version of McCarthy\\u2019s prediction of exactly how many Democrats are at risk in 2022. \\u201cThe experts are telling me that any Democrat who sits in a seat Joe Biden won by 10 points or less a year ago is vulnerable,\\u201d Emmer said.\", \"That is still roughly 250 seats. \\u201cWe will win the majority,\\u201d Emmer said flatly, \\u201cbut we\\u2019re going to let the voters tell us how big that\\u2019s going to be.\\u201d\", \"The indicators for Democrats are not quite as sour everywhere.\", \"My colleague Nate Cohn wrote earlier this week in the newsletter about two House special elections in Ohio, where Democrats finished only about three percentage points behind Biden\\u2019s performance.\", \"That is erosion, but it\\u2019s not as politically catastrophic.\", \"And in Pennsylvania, a Supreme Court vacancy was contested with millions of dollars in spending. In some ways, the contest functionally pitted a generic Democrat against a generic Republican, because even the most engaged voters know little to nothing about candidates for the judiciary.\", \"The Republican candidate won by 2.6 percentage points \\u2014 in a state Biden carried by 1.2 points in 2020. That represented a nearly four-point improvement for Republicans.\", \"To summarize, various data points show a range of possibility for Democratic decline: somewhere between three to 12 percentage points. None of the possible outcomes bode well for holding the House in 2022 or maintaining control of a Senate now equally divided between 50 Democratic-aligned senators and 50 Republicans.\", \"Perhaps what is giving Democrats the most solace is the calendar. It is 2021 still and not 2022.\", \"Democrats also hope they will have more to sell in the coming year \\u2014 Biden signed a $1 trillion infrastructure package on the South Lawn of the White House on Monday, and a $1.85 trillion social policy and climate change bill is winding its way through Congress \\u2014 and more time to sell it.\", \"Representative Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, the chairman of the D.C.C.C., has pushed for both the president and Democratic members of Congress to more forcefully pitch what they have already passed this year. As he told my colleague Trip Gabriel this month: \\u201cMy message is \\u2018free Joe Biden.\\u2019 That campaign needs to start now before the next crisis takes over the news cycle.\\u201d\", \"Maloney said it was understandable that voters hadn\\u2019t given Democrats credit for the large economic recovery measure that passed earlier in the year or for the new infrastructure spending.\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t expect them to know if we don\\u2019t tell them,\\u201d he said this week on Capitol Hill. \\u201cSo we\\u2019re going to tell them.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"638a443c48da11ecbfe86d0cb161ab1b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"638a443c48da11ecbfe86d0cb161ab1b"}},
