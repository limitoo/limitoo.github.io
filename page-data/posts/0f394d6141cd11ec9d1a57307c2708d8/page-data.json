Gavin Newsom announced he would be leading a delegation to the U.N. climate change summit in Scotland. Four days later, his office abruptly announced he had changed his mind.\", \"\\u201cFamily obligations\\u201d was all his office would say, refusing to publicly elaborate in a decision that, times being what they are, unleashed a barrage of conspiracy theories. Was the governor having a bad reaction to the Covid-19 booster shot he had just gotten? Were any of his children \\u2014 he has four ages 12 and under \\u2014 infected again with the coronavirus? No and no, Capitol sources said.\", \"Allies of the governor noted that most parents would understand why a couple with four small children might not want to take an extended trip to Glasgow over Halloween. California environmentalists also suggested that he might not be so wrong to skip the annual climate conference, which many of them view as a jet-fuel-wasting spectacle.\", \"In theory, California conservatives should also have welcomed the decision. When it appeared the governor might be summit-bound, Kevin Kiley, a Republican assemblyman who challenged the governor in the September recall election, wrote in a blog post that \\u201cin the absence of our jet-setting governor,\\u201d he was requesting a special session on the port crisis, holding oversight hearings on pandemic unemployment fraud, holding town hall events on the governor\\u2019s vaccine mandate for schoolchildren and calling for hearings on mask mandates in elementary school classrooms.\", \"\\u201cIf we don\\u2019t fight for California,\\u201d Kiley said, \\u201cno one will.\\u201d\", \"In any case, the governor \\u2014 who was to have arrived at the summit on Nov. 1 and taken a Nov. 4 return flight \\u2014 stayed home, working at his Capitol office, according to his spokeswoman, Erin Mellon. Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, the former U.S. ambassador to Hungary, led the California delegation instead. Newsom released pictures of his family (dressed as pirates) at Halloween, announced some appointments and sent out some election night encouragement to fellow Democrats.\", \"Nevertheless, as days passed with no public appearances, chatter persisted.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know where Gavin Newsom is and won\\u2019t speculate,\\u201d Kiley tweeted on Sunday. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s pretty strange for the Governor to disappear for 11 days without explanation.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhere\\u2019s Gavin?\\u201d demanded Charlie Kirk, the head of the right-wing activist group Turning Point U.S.A.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s funny how certain folks can\\u2019t handle truth,\\u201d Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the governor\\u2019s wife, shot back in a tweet that was subsequently deleted. \\u201cWhen someone cancels something, maybe they\\u2019re just in the office working; maybe in their free time they\\u2019re at home with their family, at their kids\\u2019 sports matches, or dining out with their wife. Please stop hating and get a life.\\u201d\", \"By Monday, \\u201cGavin Newsom\\u201d was trending on Twitter. Unsubstantiated conjecture included Bell\\u2019s palsy, death and that he \\u201cand Kamala Harris are in an undisclosed secret location.\\u201d Meanwhile, Vogue posted a photo spread from the lavish San Francisco wedding on Saturday of the heiress Ivy Getty, a family friend of Newsom, officiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Guests in the background of at least one photo included the governor.\", \"During a call with reporters, California senators at the Glasgow climate summit became increasingly frustrated with questions about the governor\\u2019s absence \\u2014 once, twice and then a third time. Robert Hertzberg, a Democratic senator from Van Nuys, said the delegation got a heads-up that \\u201ca family issue\\u201d would keep Newsom from joining them in Scotland. He added that he didn\\u2019t know which events the governor would tune into virtually this week.\", \"\\u201cThere is nobody in California who wanted to be at this conference more than Gavin Newsom,\\u201d Hertzberg said on Monday. \\u201cBut we\\u2019re all human beings, man, we\\u2019re all human beings \\u2014 something clearly \\u2014 he\\u2019s with his family. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s appropriate to further dig into it. I take him at face value. Whatever it is, it is. And sometimes you need to stay home.\\u201d\", \"By the end of the day, the governor\\u2019s office had issued a statement: \\u201cLast week Governor Newsom worked in the Capitol with staff on urgent issues including Covid-19 vaccines for kids, boosters, ports, the forthcoming state budget and California\\u2019s continued economic recovery. He will have public events this week related to the economy and vaccines.\\u201d\", \"In an interview, Mellon said that the governor attended the Getty wedding ceremony but not the reception; that the wedding was not the family obligation that kept him in California; that he always had been scheduled to return before the weekend; that he had been in his office, alive and well, all day on Monday; and that she had spent an hour and a half with him.\", \"No matter. As afternoon turned to evening in California, tweeters were still tweeting.\", \"\\u201cWhere is Gavin Newsom?\\u201d Kirk, the conservative activist, demanded \\u2014 again.\", \"For more:\", \"Vaccinated foreign travelers can again enter the country as restrictions that had kept families separated for months are lifted.\", \"See three $975,000 homes in California.\", \"Instant pot tomato-braised chickpeas with tahini.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes from Jessica Northrup, a reader who lives in San Diego.
