the last place you want to end up.\", \"That's because if you've got the virus, you're different to the average ICU patient.\", \"Australians have been told to expect a surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations as NSW and Victoria emerge from lengthy lockdowns.\", \"While that surge\\u00a0hasn't materialised yet, experts have warned against complacency.\", \"Here's what is required to keep you alive if you're a COVID-19 patient in ICU.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What is intensive care?</div>\", \"ICUs are wards used to care for and monitor patients with life-threatening illnesses and injuries.\", \"People admitted to them are monitored closely, and the wards operate with higher staff-to-patient ratios than the rest of the hospital.\", \"ICUs are staffed by specially trained doctors and nurses and stocked with life-saving equipment like ventilators.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/441033c4b94e2a955b3c31d39039d861\\\"

194 intensive care units, 67 of which are in NSW.\", \"According to a survey by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, the number of beds available in those units (currently hovering at about\\u00a02,180) has decreased by about 200 since the beginning of the pandemic.\", \"It costs about $4,500 per day to keep a patient in intensive care.\", \"\\\"That factors in salaries, medications, various interventions and bits of equipment associated with that intervention,\\\" Brisbane-based intensivist Anthony Holley said.\", \"\\\"Depending on what your underlying pathology is, and what you require, that may vary.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How are COVID-19 patients different?</div>\", \"COVID-19 patients typically stay in ICUs much longer than other patients.\", \"Richard Totaro, from Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, said the average stay for a non-COVID patient in ICUs was two or three days.\", \"\\\"People come in, they have heart surgery for example, they take a day or two to recover from that, and then they move on,\\\" he told the ABC in August.\", \"\\\"With COVID, what happens is that the lungs don't improve \\u2026 they can stay stuck on a ventilator for days, weeks, sometimes months.\\\"\", \"Data collected in Victoria last year showed the average length of stay for a COVID patient in intensive care was 16 days.\", \"\\\"There are patients who stayed very much longer than that, especially with the ventilated patients,\\\" Dr Holley said.\", \"\\\"And, from my own experience in Queensland, those entering ICU and being ventilated, their length of stay was closer to 25 or 30 days.\\\"\", \"Mortality rates are much higher for ICU patients who require ventilation, too.\", \"According to the Victorian data, more than one in four of those people did not survive.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What resources do COVID ICU patients need?</div>\", \"Dr Holley said the level of attention and resources required for people with COVID in intensive care was similar to other critically unwell patients.\", \"\\\"The model of care that's employed for a ventilated patient is to have one critical care nurse at the bedside constantly and physicians within the unit coming in to assess the progress and develop management plans and decisions around their care,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"It would be fair to say it would be the same volume of work with respect to the patient's illness.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/47bd95d230ea505a00a9000965ea925a\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Staff working in ICUs with COVID-19 patients need to wear full PPE.(Supplied: Alfred Hospital\\u00a0)</div>\", \"However, there is one big difference:\\u00a0personal protective equipment (PPE).\", \"Gowns, gloves, goggles, face masks and shields, amongst other PPE, take their toll on staff who are often working long shifts.\", \"\\\"Donning and doffing the equipment makes caring for that patient more arduous \\u2026 and adds on a substantial amount of time to care for the patient,\\\" Dr Holley said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How close is NSW to capacity now?</div>\", \"Right now, NSW is in a much better position than experts had expected it to be by this point.\", \"Non-urgent elective surgery was suspended in the state's hospitals for most of August and all of September, to free up resources for COVID patients, and the federal government purchased thousands of extra ventilators.\", \"The NSW government's modelling predicted COVID-19 hospitalisations would peak in mid-October.\", \"However, both hospitalisations and ICU admissions hit their highest point in September.\", \"According to figures from NSW Health, on October 2 there were 68 people in intensive care, taking up just under 8 per cent of the state's 945-bed capacity.\", \"Thirty-two of the ICU patients required ventilation.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Why haven't we seen that spike?</div>\", \"Even optimistic epidemiologists have been surprised about NSW's ability to avoid a surge in COVID-19 cases and hospital admissions since restrictions began to be lifted more than three weeks ago.\", \"The state's speedy vaccine uptake has been credited with keeping case numbers down.\", \"Yesterday, NSW Health said 93.6 per cent of people aged 16 and over in the state had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, and 88.3 per cent of people in that age range were fully inoculated.\", \"<img
