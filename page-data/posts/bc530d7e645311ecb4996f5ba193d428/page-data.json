Floyd, who grew up in Houston, was killed last year by Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer.\", \"Renae Eze, a spokesperson for Governor Greg Abbott's office, said the board will review the errors related to the applications and that the governor \\\"did not have the opportunity to consider it.\\\"\", \"In October, the board recommended Floyd's pardon for a drug conviction. Floyd was arrested in Houston for selling $10 worth of crack in a police sting in February 2004, and later pleaded guilty to a drug charge and served 10 months in prison, the Associated Press reported. But prosecutors revisited his case after a deadly Houston drug raid in 2019 that involved the same officer who arrested Floyd.\", \"Prosecutors say that officer, Gerald Goines, lied to obtain the search warrant for the raid that killed a husband and wife. Goines, who is no longer on the Houston force and faces murder charges, has denied wrongdoing. More than 160 drug convictions tied to him over the years have since been dismissed by prosecutors due to concerns about his casework, according to the AP.\", \"It would have been just the second time since 2010 that a person in Texas received a posthumous pardon from the governor.\", \"Abbott did grant pardons to eight Texas residents:\\u00a0\", \"The board said it sent an \\\"unusually high number\\\" of pardon recommendations to the governor's desk. The 67 recommendations were more than double the average Abbott typically receives in a year.\", \"Floyd was killed in May 2020. Chauvin was convicted of his killing in April 2021 and sentenced to 22-and-a-half years in prison.\", \"Sophie Reardon is a News Editor at CBS News.
