It could be the direct effect of the virus on the layer of cells which line blood vessels, an exaggerated inflammatory response to the virus, or the body making blood clots at inappropriate times.\", \"Vaccines are very effective against severe Covid, but offer less protection against infection, particularly with the Omicron variant - meaning repeat infections with symptoms are common as countries work out how to live with Covid.\", \"Frederick K Ho, public health lecturer from the University of Glasgow, said this study \\\"reminds us of the need to remain vigilant to the complications associated with even mild [Covid] infection, including thromboembolism\\\".\", \"The risk of blood clots goes up after vaccination, but \\\"the magnitude of risk remains smaller and persists for a shorter period than that associated with infection\\\", he adds.\", \"- BBC\"]","href_hash":"1866abbdb69c11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1866abbdb69c11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
