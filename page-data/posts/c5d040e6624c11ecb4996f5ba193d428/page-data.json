It was not immediately clear where the tests would come from.\", \"The plan for new federal testing sites will debut in New York City, where several new sites will be running before Christmas. And Mr. Biden intends to invoke the Defense Production Act, officials said, to accelerate production of tests.\", \"The plan has a more urgent tone than the winter pandemic strategy that Mr. Biden announced three weeks ago at the National Institutes of Health, just days after the new variant was discovered in South Africa. At the time, he promised that the 150 million Americans with private health insurance would be able to get reimbursed for at-home Covid-19 tests starting in mid-January, said his administration would improve access to booster shots and imposed new testing requirements for international travelers.\", \"But that plan \\u2014 and Mr. Biden\\u2019s broader response to the Omicron variant \\u2014 has drawn criticism from public health experts, who say the president has focused too heavily on vaccination as his central strategy. Many have called on him to be more aggressive about testing as a means of slowing the variant\\u2019s spread \\u2014 including possibly sending rapid tests to the homes of every American, free of charge.\", \"Since Mr. Biden announced his winter strategy, the Omicron variant has exploded; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Monday that it has raced ahead of other variants and is now the dominant version of the coronavirus in the United States, accounting for 73 percent of new infections last week.\", \"\\u201cWe have to acknowledge the reality that unfortunately, with a heavy heart, the virus is in charge and we need to take back control, and the only way to do that as a society is to test and isolate, test and isolate, repeat, repeat, repeat,\\u201d said Mara Aspinall, an expert in medical diagnostics at Arizona State University.\", \"Mr. Biden was himself exposed to the coronavirus late last week but has tested negative, White House officials said on Monday. With Americans already jittery about their holiday plans, he will try to reassure the nation while reminding people, yet again, that their best defense against Covid-19 is to get vaccinated and, for those who are eligible, to get booster shots.\", \"The White House is trying to avoid talk of lockdowns at all costs, and, to the consternation of some, has stopped short of urging people to cancel travel plans, avoid public transportation and the like.\", \"\\u201cThis is not a speech about locking the country down,\\u201d Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters earlier on Monday. \\u201cThis is a speech outlining and being directly clear with the American people about the benefits of being vaccinated, the steps we\\u2019re going to take to increase access, increase testing, and the risks posed to unvaccinated individuals.\\u201d\", \"But Mr. Biden will also acknowledge that the shape of the pandemic is shifting, the officials said. Breakthrough Omicron infections are common, though scientists believe that the vaccines will still provide protection against the worst outcomes. Many fully vaccinated and boosted people who are getting infected are experiencing mild symptoms or none at all.\", \"Mr. Biden will say that if people are vaccinated and follow other public health guidelines, including wearing masks in public places, \\u201cthey should feel comfortable celebrating Christmas and the holidays\\u201d with their families, one of the officials said.\", \"But beneath those notes of assurance from the president is deep concern among his advisers \\u2014 and public health experts \\u2014 about the ability of the nation\\u2019s hospitals, which are already under great strain, to withstand an Omicron surge. Even if the variant ends up causing less severe disease and a relatively low percentage of those infected need to be hospitalized, experts say, the explosion in cases means it is still possible that hospitals will become overwhelmed.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s the big concern,\\u201d said Dr. Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. \\u201cIf there are a lot of people getting sick, even if only a small portion of them are getting severely ill, that could still be a huge number of people.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden intends to direct his defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, to \\u201cready an additional 1,000 service members \\u2014 military doctors, nurses, paramedics and other medical personnel \\u2014 to deploy to hospitals during January and February, as needed,\\u201d according to a fact sheet prepared by the White House.\", \"At the same time, Mr. Biden will announce that six federal emergency response teams, with more than 100 health professionals and paramedics, will deploy immediately to six states: Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Arizona, New Hampshire and Vermont. Already, 300 federal medical workers have been deployed since Omicron was discovered in late November.\", \"Mr. Biden will also direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to work with hospitals across the country to make plans to expand capacity. FEMA will also stand up new pop-up vaccination clinics, the officials said, to handle hundreds of additional vaccinations per week.\", \"The government is also sending ventilators to the states \\u2014 last week, officials said, it sent 330 \\u2014 and will have hundreds of ambulances and emergency medical teams, overseen by FEMA, at the ready \\u201cso that if one hospital fills up, they can transport patients to open beds in other facilities,\\u201d according to the fact sheet. It was not clear who would staff those teams, but the fact sheet said that even now, \\u201c30 paramedics are heading to New Hampshire, 30 to Vermont and 20 to Arizona, and 30 ambulances are headed to New York and eight to Maine.\\u201d\", \"The White House knows that the coming weeks \\u2014 which one infectious disease expert, Michael Osterholm, has predicted will be a \\u201cviral blizzard\\u201d \\u2014 will be a test of Mr. Biden\\u2019s presidency. In announcing his winter pandemic strategy earlier this month, the president said he was \\u201csparing no effort, removing all roadblocks to keep the American people safe.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re going to fight this variant with science and speed, not chaos and confusion,\\u201d the president said then.\", \"But as Omicron took hold at lightning speed over the past few weeks, the administration\\u2019s approach seemed almost low key, with the president leaving most messaging about it to his Covid-19 Response Team and its data-focused briefings.\", \"Dr. Plescia, of the state health officials association, said he would especially like to see Mr. Biden use his platform to exhort governors and mayors to reimpose the mask mandates many have abandoned.\", \"\\u201cI think he needs to prepare the public for the fact that we may have to be more aggressive,\\u201d Dr. Plescia said. \\u201cSo far the message is we\\u2019re not doing stay-at-home orders, but I think the next thing to do would be to get much more aggressive with mask ordinances. The president has a lot of influence, and it would be maybe good to hear a little bit more of that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c5d040e6624c11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c5d040e6624c11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
