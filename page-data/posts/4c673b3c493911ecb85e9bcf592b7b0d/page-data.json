It's about services for the American people.\\\"\", \"However, economists and some lawmakers have pointed to how it would help wealthier Americans, who Democrats are targeting to foot more of the bill for their social spending plan.\", \"Analysis by CQ Roll Call, citing the most recent IRS data from 2018, showed that Democrats represent all but one of the 25 highest-taxed districts and thus would benefit the most.\", \"Among them is Pelosi's 12th congressional district where the average SALT paid by households claiming a deduction is $62,769\\u2014well under the $80,000 cap, meaning the measure could deliver significant deductions to her constituents.\", \"Households in only three districts pay more than $80,000 in SALT.
