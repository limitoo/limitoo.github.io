COVID-19 be damned.\", \"\\\"I served ... well today,\\\" said Kyrgios with an obscenity as fans roared in agreement.\", \"\\\"I don\\u0393\\u00c7\\u00d6t know what I have done to this crowd as you guys are a zoo now. I am super happy to be here again.\\\"\", \"It took only minutes for Kyrgios to ignite the terraces by breaking Broady in the opening game. He closed out the next game with an under-arm \\\"tweener\\\".\", \"Having lit a fire in the crowd, Kyrgios proved unable to control it, as fans hooted between serves and yelled at Broady to go home.\", \"\\\"I kind of know I've created this ... show, anyway,\\\" he said to chair umpire Nico Helwerth, urging the German to do more to quell the commotion.\", \"Relegated to the straight man in Kyrgios's routine, there was little for 128th-ranked qualifier Broady to do but grin and bear it as fans jeered and 41 winners fired past him.\", \"\\\"Everyone is telling me, like, 'Oh you'll really enjoy it. It's going to be amazing'. But I thought it was absolutely awful,\\\" said Broady.\", \"\\\"It's the first time I've ever walked onto a tennis court and been booed, which for me was a crazy experience.\\\"\", \"Kyrgios has a 2-0 career record over U.S. Open champion Medvedev, both wins in 2019, but never faced him at a Grand Slam.\", \"Playing a long match against the super-fit Russian may be tough for Kyrgios after his recent illness -- and especially if the match is held away from John Cain Arena.\", \"\\\"We're going to be playing on Rod Laver Arena ... Let's be honest, I think we are,\\\" he said.\"]","href_hash":"f134585c789b11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f134585c789b11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
