Also of progress.\", \"\\u201cWe knew it would mean a lot to a lot of people,\\u201d Mr. Cottrell said, including the 75 vaccinated guests who watched as the couple said \\u201cI do\\u201d on the pitcher\\u2019s mound, but also countless others who have witnessed members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community struggle to find acceptance in professional baseball and other sports.\", \"Mr. Braverman, 51, and Mr. Cottrell, 31, met in November 2019 at Mantamar Beach Club, an oceanfront bar and restaurant in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Both were on vacation: Mr. Braverman from his job with the Dodgers and Mr. Cottrell from his as a software engineer at Google in Mountain View, Calif. \\u201cWe happened to be at the same swim-up bar, sipping pi\\u00f1a coladas,\\u201d Mr. Braverman said. \\u201cWe gravitated toward each other.\\u201d\", \"After Mr. Braverman returned home to Los Angeles and Mr. Cottrell to San Francisco, the gravitational pull didn\\u2019t let up. By the end of the year, Mr. Cottrell was flying to visit Mr. Braverman every weekend. Both had acknowledged they were in love. That Mr. Cottrell didn\\u2019t care much for sports wasn\\u2019t an issue, Mr. Cottrell said.\", \"\\u201cWhen I asked what he did and he told me he worked for the Dodgers, I said, \\u2018I\\u2019m pretty sure that\\u2019s baseball, right?\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Cottrell said. Mr. Braverman, who had been on dates where his connection to the organization felt like the main attraction, was charmed. \\u201cI loved it,\\u201d he said.\", \"[Click here to binge read this week\\u2019s featured couples.]\", \"In February 2020, Mr. Cottrell, who is also a model, left his job at Google and bought a condo in Mr. Braverman\\u2019s building in West Hollywood, Calif. Mr. Braverman was at first reluctant about that decision, Mr. Cottrell said.\", \"\\u201cHe was like, I don\\u2019t want you to change your life just for me,\\u201d Mr. Cottrell said. \\u201cBut I felt like I was moving toward my forever.\\u201d\", \"The pandemic, which hit Los Angeles a month later, accelerated their romance. Mr. Cottrell had by then begun working at home as a software engineer at Zynq, an office management company in San Francisco of which his brother, David Cottrell, is a founder. Mr. Braverman was a floor away, working for the Dodgers. They met daily for lunch and dinner. \\u201cIt allowed us to really grow our relationship,\\u201d Mr. Braverman said.\", \"By the spring of 2020, Mr. Cottrell had started thinking about marriage. That May, in the early months of the pandemic and on their six-month anniversary, he tucked two rings into a picnic basket and showed them to Mr. Braverman during a \\u201csocially distanced\\u201d picnic at Dodger Stadium (they had the place to themselves). \\u201cHe said, \\u2018I\\u2019m not proposing, I just feel like we\\u2019re headed down the right path, and when the time is right, we\\u2019ll know it,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Braverman said.\", \"Mr. Cottrell knew Mr. Braverman had cause to be sensitive about timing. He had been with the Dodgers seven years in 2015 when his boss, Lon Rosen, the team\\u2019s executive vice president and chief marketing officer, encouraged him to come out to his colleagues.\", \"Major League Baseball \\u201cwas not known for being inclusive when I accepted my job,\\u201d Mr. Braverman said. \\u201cIt had been a concern to me.\\u201d But the Dodgers franchise, he found, had come a long way in its relationship with the L.G.B.T.Q. community since two women were ejected from its stadium for kissing in the stands in 2000. \\u201cEveryone from the ownership down embraced and supported me,\\u201d he said.\", \"After Mr. Braverman officially proposed on Aug. 13, 2021, Mr. Rosen told him the Dodgers would be honored to host the wedding. On Jan. 21, David Cottrell, ordained a Universal Life Church minister, married the couple in a ceremony brimming with what Mr. Cottrell called \\u201cbad baseball puns.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cFor example,\\u201d Mr. Cottrell said, \\u201cI said we had curveballs thrown at us.\\u201d\", \"Of the wedding, Mr. Braverman said, \\u201cto be able to come to the venue where I thought I would have to hide my identity, and to be able to actually celebrate marrying the man I love here\\u201d was surreal. \\u201cI never envisioned this day would happen,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"17c45a457ff911ecb7240b41c070d58c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"17c45a457ff911ecb7240b41c070d58c"}},
