On his headphones he listened to Def Leppard.\", \"Other Giant linemen, with similar thigh-size triceps and waist-size thighs, stretched nearby. Korey Cunningham did so on his back while listening to gospel music. Steam rose from his head.\", \"Above the empty MetLife Stadium stands, the sky was sludge-gray. The occasional plane slid overhead. For a moment it seemed that blue sky might break through the gray, but it did not. The punters, kickers and long snappers took to the field for their practice, then all the rest of the players. Fans filled the stadium (sort of). The game began.\", \"The weather was bleak, and so was the Giants\\u2019 offense. Saquon Barkley, the star running back, kept getting stuffed. When he came to the sideline he wrapped himself in a blue cape. With all the Giants\\u2019 punting, that happened a lot. Cape on, cape off, cape on.\", \"Line judge Mark Stewart didn\\u2019t wear gloves (in the off-season he\\u2019s a rancher in Nebraska). He stared down the line of scrimmage, legs wide. Sometimes he shuffled sideways, sometimes he blew his whistle, or flipped the ball to the other game officials. His ears started to turn pink.\", \"On the bench, the Giants\\u2019 offense huddled over tablet computers with their coaches. The bench was heated; rubber ducts shook and hummed behind it. The offense headed to the field, ran a couple of plays, punted, came back. Boos started to rain down. Rain started to rain down.\", \"Lunchtime! In Parking Lot G, sea gulls cleaned up after the tailgaters. Sometimes they took to the air and circled above the stadium (in Section 334 there may have been more birds than fans). Sea gulls are perfectly suited to Sunday\\u2019s weather, with feathers that keep the wet off, and efficient heat circulation. But enough about sea gulls! Back to the inaction on the field.\", \"The Giants quarterback was intercepted by the Washington safety, who returned the ball for a touchdown. Fans started making suggestions to the Giants, ones that can\\u2019t be printed here. Then the referee announced: \\u201cNo. 79 is eligible.\\u201d He announced this again, and fans laughed. The eighth time he made the announcement, the crowd roared. It was the biggest cheer of the day: NUMBER 79 IS ELIGIBLE!\", \"A soggy day turned soggier. Dank, chilly. On the Washington sideline, fullback Alex Armah spun on a small stationary bike to keep his legs warm. Armah looked like a teenager on a tricycle. Then, quick, off the bike and back in the game.\", \"All day, Casey Kreiter had been perfect. Kreiter is the Giants\\u2019 long snapper, and one of the best in the N.F.L. In pregame he ran around the field with a kidlike smile on his face. During the game he was all business. Keeping his hands warm, peering back between his legs, zipping the ball with accuracy, then blocking. There\\u2019s a lot to be said for doing one thing well (as opposed to, say, the Giants\\u2019 general manager). His job done, he stood alone on the sideline.\", \"And then, with a sputter, the game was over. After one last Giants interception, the players from both teams gathered at midfield. While it was the end of a sorry season, there was real camaraderie here, and shared respect.\", \"Kreiter, the long snapper, caught up with a Washington lineman. They played at Iowa together. As they gave each other thumping hugs, and headed back to their warm locker rooms, a lone piece of trash blew across the cold, hard turf.\"]","href_hash":"4e842e00725311ecab6d31168a0c9136"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4e842e00725311ecab6d31168a0c9136"}},
