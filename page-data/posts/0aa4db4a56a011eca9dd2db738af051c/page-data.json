Well, I disagree.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Malliotakis voted against certifying the results of the 2020 election even though former President Donald J. Trump\\u2019s claims of a stolen election are false \\u2014 a vote that will almost certainly become an issue in the congressional race.\", \"Last year, she beat Mr. Rose by around six percentage points, though Mr. Rose outperformed President Biden\\u2019s showing in the district, which includes strongly pro-Trump Staten Island. In that race, she sought to use Mr. Rose\\u2019s decision to join a march for racial justice as a cudgel, and he appeared to allude, in part, to that moment in his video as he discussed doing what he \\u201cthought was right\\u201d in the face of political consequences.\", \"It is not yet clear how redistricting will change the political dynamics of the district, but given Mr. Rose\\u2019s experience with challenging national headwinds, his decisions regarding campaign strategy and messaging will be closely watched as he competes in the Democratic primary.\", \"\\u201cIt should not be taboo in the Democratic Party to say that it\\u2019s time to open up completely and return to work,\\u201d he wrote on Twitter last month. \\u201cOur economy needs it. New York City\\u2019s especially.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Rose, a populist Democrat, will instantly be seen as the front-runner in the Democratic primary to take on Ms. Malliotakis. But that, too, is a contested race.\", \"Brittany Ramos DeBarros, who describes herself as an \\u201cAfro-Latina Staten Islander, community organizer and progressive combat veteran,\\u201d has been fund-raising and locking down some endorsements. She is one of many left-leaning candidates whose campaign logo appears reminiscent of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\\u2019s.\", \"Ms. Malliotakis, for her part, begins the race bolstered by a favorable national environment for Republicans, even in some corners of New York, and about $1.2 million in cash on hand, according to the most recent campaign filing. She was also one of 13 Republicans to vote for the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which will fund much-needed improvements to subways, roads, bridges and sewers in New York and could assist with general election messaging, though she has also drawn some backlash.\", \"Almost exactly one year ago, Mr. Rose launched an exploratory bid for mayor of New York City before ultimately deciding against a run. But he has remained active on the New York political circuit, attending a Staten Island Democrats event last week and joining Mayor-elect Eric Adams\\u2019s transition team.\", \"In the video, Mr. Rose, a decorated combat veteran, cited his military service and his time working as a senior adviser on Covid-19 to the secretary of defense as experiences that gave him hope.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m running because this country, it can be affordable and fair,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOur politics can lift us up, rather than tear us down. The America we believe in is possible.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"0aa4db4a56a011eca9dd2db738af051c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0aa4db4a56a011eca9dd2db738af051c"}},
