The text makes no reference to creating a \\\"pandemic treaty\\\" because that language suggests a legally binding agreement, which would require ratification.\", \"However, the draft does call for creating an \\\"intergovernmental negotiating body\\\" of WHO member states to possibly work out an agreement to improve future pandemic preparedness, prevention and response.\", \"\\\"The emergence of the highly mutated Omicron variant underlines just how perilous and precarious our situation is,\\\" Tedros said. \\\"Indeed, Omicron demonstrates just why the world needs a new accord on pandemics.\\\"\", \"Tedros said WHO scientists currently don't know the full effects of the Omicron variant, which first emerged from South Africa and Botswana. They are working urgently to determine the variant's risk factor.\", \"He said the world should be \\\"wide awake\\\" to the threat, adding, \\\"Omicron's very emergence is another reminder that although many of us might think we are done with COVID-19, it's not done with us.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1941470/who-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">World Health Organization officials began a special session with world leaders to discuss how they can prevent and fight future pandemics.

That was an allusion to travel restrictions announced by many countries on air travel to and from the region.\", \"European Union member countries and others had sought language in the draft calling for work toward a treaty, but the United States and a few other countries countered that the substance of any accord should be worked out first before any such document is given a name.\", \"Merkel, whose 16-year tenure is likely to end next week, called for \\\"reliable financing\\\" for WHO and increased contributions to the U.N. agency from its member states\\u2014while alluding to the EU position in favor of a binding agreement.\", \"\\\"The catastrophic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of health and the economy ought to be a lesson to us,\\\" she said by video message. \\\"Viruses know no national borders. That's precisely why we should lay down measures to be taken to improve prevention, early detection, and response in internationally binding fashion.\\\"\", \"Britain's ambassador in Geneva, Simon Manley, tweeted a copy of the draft text that was agreed by consensus\\u2014as required under WHO rules on such issues\\u2014and praised Chile and Australia for their work as co-chairs.\", \"\\\"The #Omicron variant shows yet again why we need a common understanding of how we prepare for and respond to pandemics, so we're all playing by the same rules,\\\" he wrote.\", \"The three-day meeting that opened Monday amounts to a long-term approach: Any U.N.-backed agreement is likely to take many months, if not years, to be concluded and come into effect.\", \"But it comes as many countries have been scrambling to address the emergence of Omicron that has led to travel bans across the world and sent tremors through stock markets on Friday.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1941467/world-health-organization-who-logo.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The World Health Organization is opening a long-planned special session of member states to discuss ways to strengthen the global fight against pandemics like the coronavirus, just as the worrying new Omicron variant has sparked immediate concerns worldwide.
