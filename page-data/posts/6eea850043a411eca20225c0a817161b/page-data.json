For more casual occasions, hashweh is also served on its own, generously topped with fried nuts. The fragrant rice, flavored with warm spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice, combines with tender meat and crispy nuts for a dish of comforting contrasts.\", \"Fadi Khayyat, a Palestinian American who immigrated to the United States from the city of Ramallah, in the West Bank, as an 8-year-old in 2003, remembers the first Thanksgiving his family celebrated. \\u201cMy mom thought she could stuff turkey the way we do chicken,\\u201d said Mr. Khayyat, who lives in New York City. \\u201cThen she heard it\\u2019s not safe because of temperature issues, so now she just makes hashweh on the side.\\u201d\", \"Over the years, Mr. Khayyat\\u2019s family has started to include more American dishes, but \\u201chashweh is always the real star,\\u201d he said. Eating any large cut of meat without rice is baffling to him.\", \"\\u201cThe turkey always has to be next to hashweh topped with pine nuts and yogurt,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf anybody ends up with dry turkey, just serve it with hashweh and yogurt, then nobody will complain about it.\\u201d\", \"In the same way, Ms. AlMahroos, 39, cannot fathom having an azoomah \\u2014 a feast or gathering of people over food \\u2014 without rice. Taking a cue from her native Bahrain, Ms. AlMahroos\\u2019s hashweh rice is flavored with cinnamon, cumin and turmeric, and has raisins alongside the nuts. \\u201cA large cut of meat has to come with rice to be presentable to guests,\\u201d she said.\", \"Hospitality is the bedrock of Arab culture, most often manifested through food. Rice-based dishes happen to be the ones that extend the most to feed a large crowd, making them the perfect choice for an Arab Thanksgiving table. Just as Arabs blend these traditions with American ones, local and seasonal ingredients are also making their ways into classic Arab hashweh.\", \"Omaya Atassi, 35, a Syrian American food writer and photographer in Dubai who grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, makes hashweh, or riz mtabal (spiced rice) as Syrians sometimes refer to it, year-round. For Thanksgiving, though, her hashweh gets a face lift: \\u201cWe use chestnuts instead of the fried nuts because of the holiday season,\\u201d she said. \\u201cTheir sweetness contrasts perfectly with hashweh\\u2019s warm spices.\\u201d\", \"For Marguerite Lian-Hajjar, hashweh is a symbol of continuity and connection to the past. A third-generation descendant of Syrian and Lebanese immigrants, Ms. Lian-Hajjar, 60, still makes hashweh the way her \\u201csitti,\\u201d or grandmother, did, out of her 2-by-4-foot kitchen in Brooklyn.\", \"\\u201cHashweh is a symbol of our mothers and their mothers before them,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s fewer and fewer ties to our past.
