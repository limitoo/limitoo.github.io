Navy spokesperson Brenda Way told The Associated Press in an email Monday that she has heard of no discussion of canceling the event because of the storms.\", \"The National Weather Service said the storm brings the threat of \\\"catastrophic flooding\\\" in the coming days as a low pressure system slowly moves from east to west and lingered on the edge of the archipelago.\", \"\\\"Now is the time to make sure you have an emergency plan in place and supplies ready should you need to move away from rising water,\\\" Ige said in a statement. \\u00a0 On Oahu, where four shelters had been opened, most of the beaches in Waikiki were empty Monday as only a few people walked with umbrellas during passing heavy showers. Roadways were flooding in the area and cars crept through downtown as water gushed out of manhole covers.\", \"On Maui, power outages and flooding were reported with more than a foot of rain falling in some areas.\\u00a0\", \"The relentless rain forced three couples from the U.S. mainland to postpone their Maui elopements, said Nicole Bonanno, owner of Bella Bloom Floral, a wedding florist and boutique in Wailea. \\u00a0 \\\"The roads, everything are a mess,\\\" she said. \\\"There are lots of trees down.\\\" \\u00a0 Maui resident Jimmy Gomes was waiting for the lights to come back at his home on Monday after losing power at 6 p.m. Sunday.

The forecast was for a foot of snow at the mountain's peak.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"e5c48c2c574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e5c48c2c574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}},
