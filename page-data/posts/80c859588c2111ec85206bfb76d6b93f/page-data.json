It\\u2019s almost guaranteed to give children, and even adults, nightmares. If you haven\\u2019t guessed by now, it\\u2019s called the Bible.\", \"Steve FoxColumbia, Md.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Most surprising? That \\u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\\u201d is among a library\\u2019s association\\u2019s 10 most-challenged books in 2020.\", \"The book explores the moral nature of human beings. While a work of fiction, it reflects an uncomfortable, painful time in our history.\", \"Fiction transports you to a different era in time. It exposes you to a different community from your own; it expands your worldview. It allows you to understand the problems humanity has grappled with over the ages.\", \"By reading literature like \\u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\\u201d children learn to think critically, to imagine, to solve problems. They become caring, thoughtful people. \\u201cYou never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view \\u2014 until you climb into his skin and walk around in it,\\u201d Atticus tells Scout.\", \"Ultimately, Harper Lee wanted us to see that good may not triumph over evil. But each and every one of us has the opportunity to make that choice. She told us, in Scout\\u2019s words to Jem: \\u201cI think there is just one kind of folks. Folks.\\u201d\", \"Laurian PennylegionRedmond, Wash.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Let the librarians do their job.\", \"Books do not end up on library shelves by accident. Librarians have guidelines that include reviews, awards, school curriculums and other factors that they take into consideration before deciding if a particular title is worth adding to the collection.\", \"It is important that a well-balanced collection is developed that will meet the needs of all and not just reflect a single point of view. Every library needs to have in place a well-defined protocol to use when there is a complaint from a member of the community. It usually includes a committee of people who have actually read the book and can discuss its value to various patrons.\", \"Calls by politicians and others to ban books they often have not read is censorship.\", \"What about parents\\u2019 rights? Monitor what your children are reading and talk to them about it. Tell them to stop reading it, if that is the right choice for your child. You do not have a right to speak for everyone in your community because you do not like the book and oppose the topic.\", \"Many thanks to those students who are speaking up at school boards for their right to have books that are important to them.

So I need to set the record straight.\", \"Every Tennessee fifth grader is required to learn about the Holocaust. My university, with its minuscule fraction of Jewish students, has a Holocaust studies minor. We host an international Holocaust conference every two years.\", \"To convey the magnitude of six million lost, three decades ago teachers in Whitwell, Tenn., asked their eighth-grade class to collect that many paper clips. They ended up with 30 million, sent to the school from people around the world. These are on display in the school\\u2019s Children\\u2019s Holocaust Memorial, housed in a boxcar from Germany, which may be the most riveting testament of young people working together to vow \\u201cNever again.\\u201d\", \"People in the rural South have different cultural norms. After moving to Tennessee, I learned you don\\u2019t swear in class.

Maybe that is the real reason the Tennessee school board preferred to limit this information to its young scholars.\", \"\\u201cBooks are inseparable from ideas,\\u201d Mr. Nguyen notes.\", \"For that reason alone the current book-banning trend in America is an abomination. It does not belong in an educated, open-minded and enlightened society.

When a librarian reported to the City Council for (usually automatic) approval of a $1,500 grant for wellness books, a commissioner wanted to know if there were any Covid books on the list. The commission delayed the approval until a complete list of books could be provided, even though other commissioners warned of the slippery slope of censorship.\", \"Two enterprising library fans started a GoFundMe site to raise the $1,500 for the books. In two weeks they raised $15,000 for the library.

When I was a young, devoutly Catholic girl of 12, I heard about a book simply called \\u201cThe Index.\\u201d I was told I was forbidden to read books that were listed in it. That proscription was like throwing red meat to a lion.

I couldn\\u2019t wait to open the small red leather-bound book she handed me, and to see what I should not see.\", \"Imagine my surprise when I discovered the authors listed in this book. They were not, as I had imagined, authors writing about sex. Instead, I saw names of the giants of the Western canon gathered before my eyes! Even I knew who Pascal, Rousseau, Stendhal and Voltaire were, although I\\u2019d not yet read them. How could this be? What did the adults not want me to know?\", \"From that time forward I was an insatiable reader of everything I could get my hands on.
