Only a few booths had been open during the previous 18 months, when a pandemic travel ban kept out most travelers other than American citizens and permanent residents or people with \\u201cessential needs.\\u201d\", \"Reyna Martinez, from Ensenada, Mexico, crossed the border with her daughter just after 6 a.m. on a tourist visa. Ordinarily, she said, she would cross at least four times a year to see friends and shop, but she hadn\\u2019t made the trip since 2019. The process on Monday was easy, she said, with border agents glancing only briefly at her proof that she had received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\", \"She was on her way to Long Beach, Calif., to see a friend, \\u201cbecause who knows if they might close it again,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI was worried that if I didn\\u2019t go now, I might miss out.\\u201d\", \"Others had more pressing concerns. Yadira Perdomo, who is Colombian, had received experimental medical treatment in Los Angeles but had not been able to see her doctor there for a follow-up. She crossed the border early on Monday in a wheelchair pushed by her sister Hannah Perdomo.\", \"Some noncitizens were able to receive medical exemptions to enter the United States during the travel ban, but the sisters wanted to cross together. They moved to Baja California two months ago to await the day when the border would open to fully vaccinated visitors. They got in line at the crossing at 3 a.m. Monday.\", \"\\u201cI feel very happy to be able to move forward with my life,\\u201d Yadira Perdomo said.\", \"In the days before the reopening, there was some confusion among Mexicans over which vaccines would be accepted and what proof would be required.\", \"Maria, who was on her way to see her granddaughter in Los Angeles and declined to give her last name, said she had received the Sinovac vaccine from China. Though the United States hasn\\u2019t authorized its use, the World Health Organization has, so it is being accepted at the border.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m going right now because I don\\u2019t need permission to, because I can,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s been very sad to be apart.\\u201d\", \"People hoping to visit the United States waited for hours last week to apply for vaccination certificates at Health Ministry offices in Tijuana. Mexican officials encouraged people to get the certificates and be included in a national database, even though the vaccination slips given out by doctors when shots are administered would be equally valid for crossing the border.\", \"Carlos Guti\\u00e9rrez, a dentist, didn\\u2019t want to take any chances. He waited in line for a certificate, just in case it would make a difference. \\u201cI have a lot of shopping to do \\u2014 video games, clothes, things you can\\u2019t get in Mexico,\\u201d he said.\", \"Though all the car lanes at San Ysidro were in use on Monday, only one pedestrian entrance was open. Another, closed throughout the travel ban, is blocked by an encampment of asylum seekers, who still cannot cross freely.\"]","href_hash":"d7a1424040cb11ec93ebdb5d81873808"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d7a1424040cb11ec93ebdb5d81873808"}},
