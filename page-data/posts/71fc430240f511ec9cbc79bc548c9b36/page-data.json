But as the former president touted baseless claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent, Christie distanced himself from Trump and encouraged him to accept defeat and recognize Biden's win.\", \"And over the weekend, Christie offered a similar message to other members of the GOP.\", \"He advised them that in order to win more elections like Republican Glenn Youngkin in Virginia's gubernatorial race, the party needs to move forward from the previous administration.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928608/donald-trump-holds-campaign-rally-fort.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Donald Trump is taking aim at his former ally Chris Christie over his statement that the Republican party needs to \\\"move on\\\" from claims that the 2020 election was stolen.

We better focus on that and take our eyes off the rearview mirror and start looking through the windshield again.\\\"\", \"Christie also emphasized that without Trump in the spotlight, Republican candidates are able to connect with voters more easily.\", \"\\\"People want us to be direct with them. They want someone to fight for them. But they want them to fight in a way that doesn't hurt their ears,\\\" Christie said. \\\"We have to speak to their dreams, their hopes, their aspirations for the future. If we don't do that, then we won't once again win back the votes that we began to win back in Virginia and New Jersey last Tuesday night.\\\"\", \"In a later interview with CNN, the former governor also said that with the midterm elections next year, Trump must decide what kind of leader he wants to be. Christie said that the former president could be a \\\"very positive force for Republican candidates\\\" if he's willing to tell the truth, specifically about the election, and look ahead to the future.\", \"But Christie's comments were met with uncertainty from members of the GOP over the weekend.
