He was 81.\", \"The cause was believed to be a heart attack, a son, Matthew Marcinko, said.\", \"Commander Marcinko climbed the ranks to command Team 6 and wrote a tell-all best seller that cemented the SEALs in pop culture as heroes and bad boys. Though the highly decorated Vietnam veteran led Team 6 for only three years, from 1980 to 1983, he had an outsize influence on the group\\u2019s place in military lore.\", \"After a failed 1980 mission to rescue 53 American hostages seized in the takeover of the United States Embassy in Tehran, the Navy asked Commander Marcinko to build a SEAL unit that could respond quickly to terrorist crises. The name itself was an attempt at Cold War disinformation: Only two SEAL teams existed at the time, but Commander Marcinko called the new unit SEAL Team 6, hoping that Soviet analysts would overestimate the size of the force.\", \"He flouted rules and fostered a maverick image for the unit. (Years after leaving the command, he was convicted of military contract fraud.) In his autobiography, \\u201cRogue Warrior,\\u201d Commander Marcinko describes drinking together as important to SEAL Team 6\\u2019s solidarity; his recruiting interviews often amounted to boozy chats in bars.\", \"For years, SEAL Team 6 embraced its rogue persona and was assigned some of the military\\u2019s toughest operations. Only Team 6 trains to chase after nuclear weapons that fall into enemy hands. And the team\\u2019s role in the 2011 raid that killed bin Laden \\u2014 the Qaeda leader who 10 years earlier had overseen the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 \\u2014 spawned a wave of\\u00a0books and movies, elevating the unit to even higher heights of fame.\", \"Young officers were sometimes run out of Team 6 for trying to clean up what they saw as a culture of recklessness. Adm. William H. McRaven, who rose to lead the Special Operations Command and oversaw the bin Laden raid, left Team 6 during the Marcinko era after disagreements about leadership.\", \"After retiring from the Navy in 1989, Commander Marcinko embarked on a career as a best-selling author, motivational speaker and military consultant, relying heavily on his authenticity as a military veteran. He also appeared on the cover of several of his books, presenting an imposing image of muscular forearms, bearded jaw and piercing eyes staring out at readers.\", \"Some SEALs over the years have said that Commander Marcinko invented his own legend. Of his 1992 book, \\u201cRogue Warrior,\\u201d written with John Weisman, David Murray wrote in The New York Times that \\u201chis story is fascinating\\u201d but the method of telling it \\u201cis not.\\u201d In the book, Commander Marcinko \\u201ccomes across as less the genuine warrior than a comic-book superhero who makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Little Lord Fauntleroy.\\u201d\", \"The book sold millions of copies. Readers apparently wanted more, and Commander Marcinko obliged. His 1995 novel, \\u201cRogue Warrior: Green Team,\\u201d also with Mr. Weisman, has \\u201cso much action that the reader scarcely has time to breathe,\\u201d Newgate Callendar, another Times reviewer, wrote.\", \"Richard Marcinko was born on Nov. 21, 1940, to George Marcinko and Emilie Teresa Pavlik Marcinko in his grandmother\\u2019s house in Lansford, Pa., a tiny mining town. In his autobiography, he described his mother as \\u201cshort and Slavic looking\\u201d and his father as dark and brooding, with a \\u201cnasty temper.\\u201d\", \"All the men in the family, Commander Marcinko wrote, were miners. \\u201cThey were born, they worked the mines, they died,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cLife was simple and life was hard, and I guess some of them might have wanted to pull themselves up by the bootstraps, but most were too poor to buy boots.\\u201d\", \"He dropped out of high school and enlisted in the Navy in 1958. He was deployed to Vietnam with SEAL Team 2 in 1967, according to the National Navy SEAL Museum, which announced the death on its Facebook page.\", \"He received many honors for his service, including four Bronze Stars, a Silver Star and a Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, according to the museum. After completing two tours in Vietnam, he was promoted to lieutenant commander and then took the reins of SEAL Team 2 from 1974 to 1976, according to the museum.\", \"Commander Marcinko is survived by his wife, Nancy; four daughters, Brandy Alexander, Tiffany Alexander, Hailey Marcinko and Kathy-Ann Marcinko; two sons, Matthew and Ritchie Marcinko; and several grandchildren. An earlier marriage to Kathy Black ended in divorce.\", \"On Sunday night, Admiral McRaven called Commander Marcinko \\u201cone of the more colorful characters\\u201d in Naval special warfare history.\", \"\\u201cWhile we had some disagreements when I was a young officer, I always respected his boldness, his ingenuity and his unrelenting drive for success,\\u201d Admiral McRaven wrote in an email. \\u201cI hope he will be remembered for his numerous contributions to the SEAL community.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"7bf0c328671b11ec8e234fb299b2d28a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7bf0c328671b11ec8e234fb299b2d28a"}},
