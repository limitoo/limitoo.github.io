That the municipal supply of Flint, Mich., is slowly killing three generations of Black women living under one roof isn\\u2019t a dramatic revelation, but the grim, yearslong reality embodied in Erika Dickerson-Despenza\\u2019s \\u201cCullud Wattah.\\u201d\", \"In a haunting and eye-opening production, directed by Candis C. Jones and which opened on Wednesday at the Public Theater, the playwright excavates the human costs behind familiar and devastating headlines.\", \"\\u201cLead in thuh wattah,\\u201d five actors sing as the show opens. A riff on the spiritual \\u201cWade in the Water\\u201d aligns present-day woes with Black traditions of perseverance. Emerging from the darkened periphery with jugs in hand, they recount the circumstances of the crisis like morbid poetry: When the city switched its water supply, who is responsible, how tea began to smell of sewage and rashes spread across their bodies.\", \"Urgency in the face of deadliness, \\u201cCullud Wattah\\u201d points out, is not afforded to Black communities on the margins. The setting is November 2016, 939 days since Flint had clean water, and the repercussions continue to cascade.\", \"Marion (Crystal Dickinson) is a third-generation union assembly worker at General Motors, the city\\u2019s flagship employer. Her pregnant sister, Ainee (Andrea Patterson), is in recovery from crack addiction. The slight but indomitable Big Ma (Lizan Mitchell) keeps everyone in line, including Marion\\u2019s daughters, Reesee (Lauren F. Walker), a queer freethinking teenager with spiritual ties to the continent, and a sly 9-year-old named Plum (played by the adult actress Alicia Pilgrim), who has been undergoing treatment for leukemia.\", \"Out of both love and necessity, the women support and care for one another. Marion adjusts Plum\\u2019s wig before her first day back at school. Ainee applies lip liner to her sister when tremors in Marion\\u2019s hands flare up, from illness or nerves about dating again after her husband\\u2019s death.\", \"The set design, by Adam Rigg, suggests a house stripped to its raw wood foundations, with hundreds of bottles of murky water lined up and suspended in the air, one for each day it continues to flow from the tap. Bottles of clean water sit atop the refrigerator. (A filter promised by the city should arrive any day now.) The lighting design, by Jeanette Oi-Suk Yew, is anxious and spectral, while Kara Harmon\\u2019s costumes lend the women an everyday earthiness.\", \"How many bottles of water are needed to do things that most people take for granted \\u2014 washing Thanksgiving vegetables, for example (26) \\u2014 is the kind of granular detail the play brings into focus.\", \"The plot stirs around the effect that toxins have had on the family, both internally and externally. \\u201cWe all marked,\\u201d says Ainee, who walks in the house one day with a flier containing information about a class-action suit. Marion\\u2019s job at GM, and a potential promotion to management, means she would risk their livelihood if she were to get involved \\u2014 the moral compromise of capitalism and the weight of personal responsibility coming to a head.\", \"Dickerson-Despenza\\u2019s lyrical prose is laced with humor, and she creates lively and warmhearted characters. Which makes it all the more enraging to watch them struggle against a steady poisoning. Her narrative mode is one of querying the past, not so much to expose fresh facts as to ensure that what should already be known is also deeply felt.\", \"While the playwright generates affecting emotion throughout, a fair portion of the dialogue is used to deliver exposition and impassioned proclamations about the impact of contaminated water, even when characters are relating to each other. Jones\\u2019 fluid and intimate direction mostly keeps the text from feeling too bogged down in these details.\", \"\\u201cCullud Wattah\\u201d excels most when generating heat from familial conflict. Performances by the winning ensemble members are nimbly attuned to the language of mothers and sisters, from knowing shrugs and sideways glances to the straight-on withering glares. And in the hands of Dickinson and Patterson, fireworks light up the story at its climax, when long-silenced resentments finally detonate in the sort of blaze that only arises from love.\", \"Inseparable as real-world calamity has become from the realm of art, Dickerson-Despenza\\u2019s \\u201cCullud Wattah\\u201d is especially suited to a moment of environmental unrest. After the play comes to an abrupt end, the cast stands in silence before leaving the stage. They don\\u2019t return for a bow, as if this had not been a performance but a call to account.\"]","href_hash":"28eb997a481f11ec9c8733dab0cd5f77"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"28eb997a481f11ec9c8733dab0cd5f77"}},
