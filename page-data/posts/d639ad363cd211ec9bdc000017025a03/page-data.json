Along with other Republicans, he argued against \\u201ccritical race theory\\u201d and for \\u201cparents\\u2019 rights.\\u201d He made an issue of the state\\u2019s slow reopening of schools during the pandemic.\", \"The governor\\u2019s race was widely seen as both a referendum on the nation\\u2019s mood and a test of the Republican school strategy with suburban swing voters, particularly white women.\", \"One book became a specific target of Republicans: \\u201cBeloved,\\u201d the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Toni Morrison.\", \"The book, which has become a fixture of the American literary canon since it was published in 1987, conveys the horrors of slavery, a subject with obvious historical resonance in Virginia. It details episodes of sexual violence.\", \"Eight years ago, a Virginia parent pushed to ban it from her son\\u2019s curriculum, after learning he was assigned the book for his senior-year AP English class.\", \"The parent, Laura Murphy, took her campaign to the Republican-controlled General Assembly. Lawmakers passed what became known as the \\u201cBeloved bill,\\u201d which would have given parents the right to opt their children out of reading books with \\u201csexually explicit content.\\u201d Terry McAuliffe, then the governor, vetoed the legislation.\", \"On Tuesday, McAuliffe lost to Youngkin, and that veto played a role.\", \"As Election Day inched closer, Murphy appeared in an ad for Youngkin.\", \"\\u201cIt gave parents a say \\u2014 the option to choose an alternative for my children,\\u201d Murphy said in the ad, speaking of the vetoed bill. McAuliffe, she said, \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t think parents should have a say.\\u201d In the ad, she didn\\u2019t mention that the book was \\u201cBeloved.\\u201d\", \"Many educators have pushed back on this campaign against the book.\", \"\\u201cWhat Morrison does is ask that the reader look at the horrors of slavery without any blinders on,\\u201d Emily Knox, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\\u2019s School of Information Sciences, told Slate. \\u201cIt\\u2019s so graphic because that\\u2019s what Morrison was trying to do.\\u201d\", \"For the midterm elections next year, there are signs that Republicans may step up their campaign on educational issues.\", \"In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott is pushing to block books in school libraries with \\u201cpornography or other inappropriate content,\\u201d following up on state legislation that banned \\u201ccritical race theory.\\u201d A state representative, Matt Krause, is also launching a probe into books in school libraries. Krause, a Republican, asked school leaders to identify copies of about 850 specific books and report how much they cost the districts.\", \"Turning schools into a cultural war zone by railing against equity initiatives, books with sexual content and public health measures is a way to avoid tackling issues like budget cuts and the other thornier problems facing American education.\", \"And in Virginia, the strategy paid off: He won Republican voters both devoted to and disdainful of Donald Trump. And in cities, suburbs and exurbs that President Biden had handily carried, McAuliffe\\u2019s margins shrank dramatically.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not like, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m against the debt ceiling,\\u2019\\u201d said John Whitbeck, a former chairman of the Republican Party from Loudoun County, Va., a center of school board fights. \\u201cThis is like, \\u2018You\\u2019re destroying our children\\u2019s education.\\u2019 And, look, angry people vote.\\u201d\", \"On Tuesday, the C.D.C. formally endorsed the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds. More than 28 million children are now eligible for shots.\", \"Pediatric vaccinations could buttress national defenses against a possible winter surge. And they could change the debate around mask mandates in schools, my colleague Jessica Grose wrote in an Opinion column.\", \"\\u201cMaybe the carrot of mask-free schools will inspire some more hesitant families to get their children vaccinated,\\u201d she wrote.\", \"Jessica interviewed 11 experts, and they had mixed opinions on whether masks would remain necessary in schools.\", \"Some thought masks should stay on, especially to protect immuno-compromised children and those under 5. Others were more skeptical: Masks may have long-term costs \\u2014 especially for children with speech difficulties, autism or sensory challenges.\", \"But most agreed that the vaccine would change the game. A few experts suggested that districts lift mandates after children have time to get both doses of Pfizer\\u2019s vaccine.\", \"\\u201cWe haven\\u2019t been able to have a practical, nuanced and data-driven conversation about what a good masking policy would look like now that nearly all school-age kids can soon be vaccinated,\\u201d Jessica wrote.\", \"School masking remains a politically charged issue. Many blue states and big cities require masks; many red states have banned them. Just last week, Massachusetts extended its universal mask mandate for most public schools through mid-January, while Florida stripped federal aid from schools with mandates. Tennessee may also make mask mandates more difficult to implement.\", \"But with or without masks, this fall has been smoother sailing: A vast majority of students have been in classrooms full-time.\", \"\\u201cWe need to figure this out,\\u201d Linsey Marr, an engineering professor at Virginia Tech who studies the airborne transmission of viruses, told Jessica. \\u201cThe vaccine should change things for us, and we don\\u2019t want kids to wear masks in school indefinitely.\\u201d\", \"In other virus news:\", \"College\", \"Social change and equity\", \"Violence and safety\", \"Some parents take a hands-on approach to homework.

(The big kids are supposed to read for about half an hour each night.) So they rotate, page by page.\", \"\\u201cWe are always sure to read expressively and do voices for the characters and stop and talk with each other about our questions and predictions,\\u201d Katie wrote. \\u201cNow that the kids are back in the school building, it gives us some quality time together. \\u201d\", \"Thank you to all who shared.
