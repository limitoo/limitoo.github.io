That's compared to 45 percent of those who answered they have a \\\"very favorable\\\" impression of the organization when asked how they viewed the organization in general, and without the new initiative.

RMG is owned by Scott Rasmussen, an American public opinion pollster and political analyst who founded Rasmussen Reports.\", \"\\\"The fact that it (the 'Let's Talk About Race' initiative) caused 42 percent of respondents to both be more likely and less likely to donate suggests extreme movement caused by [Critical Race Theory] (CRT) ideology,\\\" said Kenny Xu, president of Color Us United, which advocates for a race-blind America.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949652/rmg-research-survey.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"Xu's organization recently launched its \\\"Just Say It\\\" campaign, which asks The Salvation Army to publicly state that America is not a racist country.\", \"\\\"Our message is still based on the Bible. Our ministry is still motivated by the love of God. And our mission is still to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ and meet human needs in His name without discrimination,\\\" he added.\", \"It was in July that The Salvation Army disseminated its new initiative through its International Social Justice Commission to field officers by the organization's four territorial commanders. In January, active officers in The Salvation Army's western territory were trained in matters of racial equity in a compulsory manner. The agenda for the Territorial Virtual Officers' Councils on Racial Equity workshop mirrored the \\\"Let's Talk About Racism\\\" resource put out by the commission and was required of current officers.\", \"In summary, the curriculum outlines alleged Christian racial complicity and provides action steps to analyze and combat racism through an \\\"anti-racist\\\" lens while incorporating CRT. Definitions of institutional and systemic racism are included with sections addressing topics including police brutality, health care and Black unemployment, linking them to \\\"racial inequity.\\\"\", \"The initiative drew criticism from many stalwart supporters including Christian apologist and radio talk show host Greg Koukl, who publicly noted he would no longer be a donor to SA.\", \"Xu wrote a commentary published in the conservative news website The Daily Signal, which addressed the commission's mixing of \\\"admirable human rights works with politically charged advocacy based in politics.\\\"\", \"Now, through Color Us United's \\\"Just Say It\\\" campaign, he's asking SA officials to publicly declare that American is not racist.\", \"\\\"America is not a racist country \\u2013 in fact, it is the country that enables The Salvation Army to do its good works for the poor and marginalized across the world,\\\" said Xu, noting that the U.S. funds a significant portion of the organization's worldwide operations in Africa, Asia and South America. \\\"Why would a racist country do something like that? This is why donors feel so betrayed because The Salvation Army is putting the people that so lavishly allow them to do their good works \\u2013 they're throwing them under the bus.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"2604203c5a1311eca8048383afcb6bdd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2604203c5a1311eca8048383afcb6bdd"}},
