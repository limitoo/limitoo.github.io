He requested that the U.S. provide full details about the incident, which involved the nuclear-powered submarine USS Connecticut striking an underwater mountain.\", \"\\\"We once again urge the U.S. to give a detailed account of the accident,\\\" he said during the briefing.\", \"Wenbin further describes how the U.S. fails to offer \\\"a clear explanation\\\" of the submarine's purpose in the area. According to the spokesman, this demonstrates that the U.S. is showing a \\\"lack of transparency and responsibility\\\" regarding the incident. He continued further, saying that the nation could not provide \\\"the specific location of the accident, whether it was in another country's exclusive economic zone or even territorial waters, whether it caused a nuclear leak or damaged marine environment.\\\"\", \"China controls the international trade that occurs in the South China Sea.\", \"The U.S. Navy has previously said that the USS Connecticut's nuclear reactor and propulsion system were not damaged in the incident. The striking of the submarine occurred on Oct. 2. However, the military branch did not report the incident until five days later.\", \"The USS Connecticut is currently located in Guam for a damage assessment. The Navy has yet to respond to Wenbin's comments.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1924379/uss-connecticut-2016.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Seawolf-class fast-attack submarine USS Connecticut (SSN 22) departs Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for sea trials following a maintenance availability, Dec. 15, 2016, in Washington.

Six governments claim islands, atolls, and exclusive economic zones in the sea, while the U.S. insists that freedom of navigation be maintained, reinforcing that with regular military flights and naval patrols, and training missions around the region.\", \"The collision caused a small number of moderate and minor injuries to the crew. USNI News, which was first to report that the submarine had struck a seamount, said damage to the forward section of the sub included its ballast tanks.\", \"\\\"We reiterate that the United States must take the concerns of all parties seriously, take a responsible attitude and give a detailed explanation of the incident as soon as possible, so as to satisfactorily address the concerns of the international community as well as regional countries,\\\" said Tan in a press conference last month.\"]","href_hash":"3d182a5e3bf311ec85de000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3d182a5e3bf311ec85de000017025a03"}},
