Doctor in Michigan, Where Unvaccinated People Are Filling Hospital Beds\\u201d (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Dec. 8):\", \"Dr. Rob Davidson\\u2019s experiences at a small Michigan hospital mirror my own working as a staff pharmacist at a small regional medical center in Minnesota.\", \"Vaccination rates in our county are barely 40 percent. For more than a month we have seen our patient census at two to three times normal, with anywhere from a third to two-thirds of patients ill with Covid-19. The vast majority of them are unvaccinated.\", \"Our emergency room is constantly full with all manner of patients, though those with Covid-19 or suspected Covid-19 make up the majority. The sickest become boarders in our E.R., too ill to go home but with no beds in our medical center or anywhere else in the state to send them to. Wait times in our E.R. have mushroomed from minutes to many hours.\", \"Staff in every department (doctors, nurses, housekeeping, pharmacy, lab \\u2026) is under tremendous strain. Determination to give quality care coexists with fear of missing something important while caring for so many patients. The stress has become more evident daily in fatigue, momentary flares of temper and tears. We are drowning in patients.\", \"Ken VaselaarCambridge, Minn.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Dr. Rob Davidson writes: \\u201cWith every shift, I see the strain people sick with Covid-19 put on my hospital. Their choice to not get vaccinated is not personal. It forces patients with ruptured appendixes and broken bones to wait for hours in my emergency department; it postpones surgeries for countless other people and burns out doctors and nurses.\\u201d\", \"Hospitals need to establish triage guidelines that place higher priority on patients who are vaccinated and require treatment above Covid patients who come to the hospital and are unvaccinated. It is absolutely unacceptable that the irresponsible actions of unvaccinated people should harm the health of others. There must be consequences for their carelessness and disregard for others.\", \"Rob FenstermacherWhite Plains, N.Y.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Isn\\u2019t it ironic that the same anti-vaxxers who end up in hospitals willingly accept all of the medical interventions offered to them? They don\\u2019t want a vaccine to avoid getting sick but will accept intubation, drugs, oxygen and whatever else is offered to try to save their lives.\", \"The excuses given for not taking the vaccine such as \\u201cit\\u2019s not a proven science\\u201d or \\u201cI don\\u2019t trust the drug companies\\u201d or \\u201cthere isn\\u2019t enough evidence\\u201d sound hollow against the willingness to try novel approaches to saving their lives with new drugs and therapies.\", \"Hold up a mirror to their hypocrisy.\", \"Sally BaydalaCalgary, Alberta\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cA Half-Trillion-Dollar Boost for the Fight to Save the World From Warming\\u201d (news article, Nov. 20):\", \"When it comes to climate change mitigation, it\\u2019s not how much money we spend that counts, but how much emissions we reduce. Scientists warn us of the dire consequences of continuing to burn fossil fuels.\", \"President Biden wisely set a goal of reducing emissions 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. In its current form, Build Back Better offers to spend $555 billion luring businesses and consumers to reduce emissions. It won\\u2019t be enough.\", \"This article acknowledges that economists say creating incentives through tax credits will not get us to our goal, that the most effective way to reduce emissions is to tax the polluting industry. If the Build Back Better legislation required coal, oil and gas companies to pay an increasing tax on their carbon pollution, the transition would be accelerated, investments in alternatives spurred and revenue provided to ease the transition for consumers.\", \"Further, if the tax applied to imports, all nations (including China) would be incentivized to adopt similar policies.\", \"Bob TaylorMontecito, Calif.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"It is generally thought that a Supreme Court decision voiding Roe v. Wade would backfire against conservatives by energizing the left. Wouldn\\u2019t it also backfire in another way? There are millions of people for whom abortion is the defining issue.

My wife says I complain too much when people don\\u2019t respond, and she\\u2019s right. Mostly, I write for myself, and I know that.\", \"I write them at an old desk surrounded by photos of family and friends, those passed on and those still receiving earthly dispatches.
