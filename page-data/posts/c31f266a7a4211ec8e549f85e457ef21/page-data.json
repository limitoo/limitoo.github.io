Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.\", \"Some even described the condition of the reef, hidden at depths between 30 meters (about 100 feet) and 100 meters in the crystalline waters of the South Pacific, as \\u201cpristine.\\u201d\", \"Alexis Rosenfeld, an underwater photographer from Marseille, France, said on Thursday that the reef lived up to what he had envisioned when he first explored it shortly after its discovery in November.\", \"\\u201cThis, my dream, is exactly the same as the reality,\\u201d Mr. Rosenfeld said of the reef, which is about two kilometers off the shore.\", \"Mr. Rosenfeld, 52, photographed the reef as part of a deep sea exploration project called 1 Ocean, partnering with UNESCO and researchers from CRIOBE, a prominent French laboratory specializing in the study of coral reef ecosystems, and the French National Centre for Scientific Research.\", \"The reef occupies an area of the ocean known as the mesophotic zone \\u2014 from the Greek words for middle and light \\u2014 where the algae that coral depends on for survival can still grow but where light penetration is significantly diminished, scientists said.\", \"Unlike coral reefs found at shallower depths, which are often shaped like branches and are more susceptible to being damaged by rising ocean temperatures, scientists said, mesophotic reefs form their floral shape to gain more surface area and receive more light. To capture images in low-light conditions, Mr. Rosenfeld said he used a Sony Alpha 1, a mirrorless full-frame camera.\", \"Julian Barbi\\u00e8re, the head of the Marine Policy and Regional Coordination Section for the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission at UNESCO, said on Thursday that he was blown away by the expanse of rose petals captured in the photos.\", \"\\u201cYou can see them as far as the eye can see,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhen they came back and showed the pictures, we were really amazed by the quality of the ecosystem there.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Barbi\\u00e8re noted that climate change posed a significant threat to coral reefs, especially those at shallower depths, like the ones damaged in recent years in the South Pacific in what is known as bleaching. As part of that process, coral loses its color and its skeleton is exposed.\", \"\\u201cThat can destroy or really impact the coral reef,\\u201d he said.\", \"Reaching the coral reef presented a particular challenge to scientists and photographers because of its depth, those involved in the project said. It required them to use special breathing equipment and a mixture of gases that contained helium, they said.\", \"John Jackson, a film director with 1 Ocean who is involved with the project, compared the reef\\u2019s shape to lacework. In an interview on Thursday, he said that significant work remained when it came to underwater exploration, pointing out that only about 20 percent of the world\\u2019s seabeds had been mapped.\", \"\\u201cWe know every detail of Mars, every detail of the moon and certain planets,\\u201d Mr. Jackson said.\", \"Richard Norris, a professor of paleobiology at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved with the project, said on Thursday that the discovery was gratifying.\", \"\\u201cTahiti is nice because it\\u2019s far from sediment sources on land where the water could end up being cloudy and making it harder for the algae to grow in these deep water reefs,\\u201d Professor Norris said.\", \"He likened the relationship between coral and algae to that of the human body and yeast, saying that it was critical to maintain a delicate balance.\", \"\\u201cIf they get stressed by, for example, unusually warm temperatures, then it turns a symbiotic relationship with the algae to one that is antagonistic, where the algae damage the coral and the coral gets rid of them,\\u201d Professor Norris said.\", \"Once the reef and the marine species that call it home are better understood, those involved in the project said that they would seek to adopt conservation measures to protect the ecosystem.\", \"\\u201cWithout exploration,\\u201d Mr. Rosenfeld said, \\u201cyou can\\u2019t have science.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c31f266a7a4211ec8e549f85e457ef21"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c31f266a7a4211ec8e549f85e457ef21"}},
