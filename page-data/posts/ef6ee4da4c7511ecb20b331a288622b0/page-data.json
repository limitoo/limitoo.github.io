Travis McMichael is accused of shooting Mr. Arbery.\", \"The men intimidated Mr. Arbery \\u201cbecause of Arbery\\u2019s race and color,\\u201d the eight-page federal indictment said. The McMichaels and Mr. Bryan are white; Mr. Arbery was Black.\", \"Mr. Bryan told investigators that he heard Travis McMichael use a racial slur after shooting Mr. Arbery, fueling the notion that the killing was motivated by race. Mr. McMichael\\u2019s defense team has denied the claim.\", \"The men did not face hate-crime charges at the state level because Georgia had no such law at the time of Mr. Arbery\\u2019s death. The state Supreme Court struck down a hate-crime statute in 2004 for being too vague, making Georgia one of the few states without such a statute.\", \"But Mr. Arbery\\u2019s killing united Republican and Democratic lawmakers, leading them to pass a new hate-crime law months afterward.\", \"Georgia\\u2019s new statute allows for extra penalties for people who commit crimes against others based on their race, gender, sexual orientation and other identities. Law enforcement officials are required to file reports of these kinds of crimes so the state can track them.\", \"Hate-crime cases can be difficult to prosecute because of the need to prove that the motive is directly tied to a victim\\u2019s identity. Still, the application of the laws often provides reassurance to victims and their families because it acknowledges the distinct nature of those crimes.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s a feeling it wasn\\u2019t just an ordinary crime, there was something particularly egregious about this offense, and hate-crime laws offer us a way of recognizing that and offer sort of an official way for our society to say these behaviors are particularly awful,\\u201d said Phyllis B. Gerstenfeld, a criminal justice professor at California State University, Stanislaus, with expertise in hate crimes.\", \"The first test of Georgia\\u2019s law may be the trial of Robert Aaron Long, the man facing the death penalty for a shooting rampage at three spas in the Atlanta area in March. The use of the law in a case that has drawn national attention, however, does not mean its use will become widespread.\", \"\\u201cJust because the law is seen as valid and has been used in a high-profile case or two, it still doesn\\u2019t mean that it\\u2019s going to necessarily have a lot of practical use,\\u201d Ms. Gerstenfeld said.\"]","href_hash":"ef6ee4da4c7511ecb20b331a288622b0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ef6ee4da4c7511ecb20b331a288622b0"}},
