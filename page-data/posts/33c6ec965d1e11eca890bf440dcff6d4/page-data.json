Those waiting for their applications to be processed could be placed in temporary shelters at a country's border for up to 16 weeks.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1951850/european-union-belarus-refugees-asylum.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The EU announced Tuesday new proposals for rule changes to security measures in place at borders within the region, potentially allowing countries to delay asylum applications longer.

It's not the end of the story but it's enough to keep Schengen intact,\\\" Schinas told reporters in Strasbourg, France, as he unveiled the proposals, which must be endorsed by EU countries and lawmakers to take effect.\", \"The Schengen travel zone system has been on the verge of collapse since 2015, when well over 1 million people entered the EU without authorization, mostly Syrians seeking refuge from war. A series of extremist attacks in France, Belgium and Germany also saw countries tighten their border controls.\", \"Things got even worse in early 2020 when the pandemic hit. At least 17 countries in the Schengen zone reintroduced checks in the panic, causing traffic and supply chain chaos.\", \"Fast-track deportations would be permitted for those not allowed in by asylum.\", \"To stop member countries imposing ad-hoc border checks between each other inside the Schengen travel zone, temporary controls could be reintroduced for health or security threats for six months, which could be renewed for up to two years.\", \"Countries would have to provide an impact assessment justifying the renewal. The commission, which proposes EU laws and supervises the way they are applied, would have to approve any extension beyond 18 months.\", \"Six countries in the zone have kept border checks in place for the last six years renewing them every six months to circumvent rules that they should not be permanent. That includes France, which has continually had border controls for security reasons since the deadly 2015 attacks in Paris.\", \"The Associated Press contributed to this report.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1951854/european-union-belarus-refugees-asylum.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Pedestrians climb stairs in front of EU flags at the Berlaymont building, headquarters of the European Commission, on Sept. 29, 2021 in Brussels, Belgium.
