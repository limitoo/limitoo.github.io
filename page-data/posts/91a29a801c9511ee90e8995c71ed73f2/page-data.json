Te Whatu Ora also distributed 3.1 million RATs in the period 21 May - 18 June 2023. Future usage is dependent on a number of factors including COVID-19 case rates, people with symptoms, and public health settings,\\\" a spokesperson said.\", \"They provided a detailed defence of the purchase.\", \"\\\"New Zealand's Covid-19 public health response was unique and the largest of its type ever conducted in the country's history,\\\" the spokesperson said.\", \"\\\"The quantity of Covid-19 response stocks (including RATs) purchased were integral to allowing us to be prepared as a country and enabling government response restrictions to relax over time.\\\"\", \"The spokesperson said RATs became a critical tool for governments around the world to help reduce the spread of Covid-19, particularly during the Omicron outbreak, and providing them meant treatment and care could be targeted quickly.\", \"\\\"RAT stocks for New Zealand were first secured during the Delta outbreak. Large quantities were purchased in late 2021 and early 2022 as we prepared for the new strain of the virus, Omicron, to spread throughout New Zealand's communities. Supply and demand were based on the projected impact assessments for Omicron and in the context of significant global supply chain constraints including logistics and production timeframes.\\\"\", \"They said other efforts were being made to mitigate wastage, including with shelf-life extensions, deferring orders, and offering products to other countries. A way of sustainably recycling unused tests was also being explored.\", \"\\\"Over the course of the response to date, more than 122 million RAT tests have been successfully delivered.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"91a29a801c9511ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"91a29a801c9511ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
