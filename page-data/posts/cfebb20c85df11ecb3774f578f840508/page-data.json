As a result, Americans are likely to find themselves paying\\u00a0more for loans and credit this year.\", \"Wall Street analysts have speculated the central bank will lift rates three or four times this year, with each increase boosting the benchmark federal funds rate by 0.25%, or even 0.5% increases if the highest inflation in 40 years persists and the Fed decides to slam on the brakes to cool a heating economy. The January jobs report has raised those expectations for some.\", \"\\\"The Federal Reserve is going to be forced to raise rates more quickly and to a higher level, as wage growth jumped up to 0.7% on a month-over-month basis,\\\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance in an email, in reaction to the jobs report.\\u00a0\", \"Other analysts, however, remain skeptical. \\\"The report will undoubtedly add to speculation that the Fed will tighten by [0.5 percentage points] in March, although we still think officials are unlikely to move that aggressively with the first change in a tightening cycle,\\\" analysts at TD Securities reported.\", \"The S&P 500 slipped 0.1% in the early going Friday, but was back up by nearly as much as of 12:00 p.m. EST.

Meta's mauling erased more than $230 billion in market value, easily the biggest one-day loss in history for a U.S. company. The stocks of Twitter and other social media companies also fell, and the Nasdaq gave up 3.7%, its biggest loss since September 2020.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"cfebb20c85df11ecb3774f578f840508"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cfebb20c85df11ecb3774f578f840508"}},
