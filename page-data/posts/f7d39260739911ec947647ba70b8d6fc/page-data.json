There is also a growing debate about which should be the higher priority.\", \"The first category includes the issues that have long animated voting-rights advocates, like expanded voting access \\u2014 through mail ballots, for example \\u2014 as well as restrictions on partisan gerrymandering and campaign donations. Advocates say these policies are particularly important because of Republican efforts to restrict voting, especially among Black, Latino and younger Americans, and draw gerrymandered districts.\", \"The second category was obscure until the 2020 presidential election. It involves new laws to prevent the subversion of an election after it happens, as Donald Trump and his supporters tried do in 2020 and have signaled they may try again.\", \"Some experts believe that both categories are vital and that viewing them separately is a mistake. Others say that while the first is important, it\\u2019s also part of a centuries-long, back-and-forth struggle to expand voting access \\u2014 while the second is urgent, given the looming threat of an overturned election.\", \"Today, we walk you through the case being made by each side in the debate \\u2014 as well as the latest news, including Biden\\u2019s speech yesterday, delivered at a group of historically Black colleges in Atlanta.\", \"The major recent voting legislation from congressional Democrats has focused more on the first category.\", \"The House last year passed a sweeping bill that would, among other things, mandate automatic voter registration, ban partisan gerrymandering and expand early voting. A compromise bill, favored by Senator Joe Manchin, would include narrower versions of many such ideas, as well as a voter-identification requirement, which is a Republican priority.\", \"Some voting-rights advocates favor an ambitious approach that combines these ideas with attempts to crack down on Trump-like subversion of vote counting. \\u201cIt\\u2019s all one related attack,\\u201d Wendy Weiser of the Brennan Center for Justice told us. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not enough to just stop the attempt to sabotage at the very end of the process if the process is being undermined at every other phase.\\u201d\", \"One rationale: It remains unclear whether Republicans will agree to any voting-rights bill. If Democrats have to pass a bill along partisan lines, according to this view, they should pass the best, broadest bill, one that does everything possible to protect basic rights.\", \"American democracy is facing \\u201can existential crisis,\\u201d The Washington Post\\u2019s Perry Bacon Jr. has written, \\u201cand it should be treated like one.\\u201d\", \"Other voting-rights activists consider this view na\\u00efve. They say that an ambitious, partisan legislative push is doomed, given Democrats\\u2019 narrow Senate majority \\u2014 and that the Trumpist threat to democracy is a true emergency.\", \"Our colleague Nate Cohn, who covers elections, calls the possibility of election subversion \\u201cthe most insidious and serious threat to democracy.\\u201d Rick Hasen, an election-law expert at the University of California, Irvine, told us, \\u201cThis is a house-on-fire moment, and the priority should be trying to find bipartisan paths toward compromise.\\u201d (In a recent Times Opinion article, Hasen wrote that Democrats have not focused enough on the threat.)\", \"Hasen and others have suggested rewriting the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which is now fairly vague. A strengthened version of it might raise the bar for when a state legislature could declare an election to be void. It could limit the occasions to a terrorist attack or natural disaster, rather than allowing a legislature to do so by citing (often false) claims of fraud.\", \"Manchin\\u2019s compromise bill includes a couple of other ideas that voting-rights experts favor: a requirement that voting machines produce a paper ballot for every vote; and limits on when election officials can be removed from office.\", \"Advocates of a narrower approach note that some Republicans appear willing to consider it. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, has suggested that he might be open to reforming the Electoral Count Act. Susan Collins of Maine has convened a bipartisan group to discuss electoral reform, including changes to the 1887 law. \\u201cAnother issue that we\\u2019re taking a look at is how we could protect election officials from harassment,\\u201d Collins told Punchbowl News.\", \"(Yuval Levin, a conservative policy expert, has laid out what a compromise bill might look like.)\", \"For now, Democrats appear more focused on the more ambitious option. If they had even slightly larger congressional majorities, that approach might be promising. But they do not. They cannot afford to lose even a single Democratic senator.\", \"In his speech yesterday, Biden called on the Senate to pass voting-rights legislation, even if it requires changing the filibuster. If that happened, Democrats could pass a bill without any Republican support.\", \"In doing so, Biden heeded the calls of Democratic activists who have been urging him to put more pressure on Congress. In reality, though, he does not have much leverage. He cannot force Manchin and several other senators who generally support the filibuster to change their minds.\", \"It seems to be an example of what Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College, calls \\u201cthe Green Lantern Theory of the Presidency\\u201d after the superhero of the same name. Nyhan coined the phrase to describe the mistaken belief that presidents can force Congress to act by trying really, really hard.\", \"Still, there is a scenario \\u2014 albeit an unlikely one \\u2014 in which the new attention on the issue might lead to a new law. Perhaps a bipartisan group of senators will come up with a narrow bill that can win 60 votes and overcome a filibuster. Or perhaps the Democratic holdouts will decide that the issue is important enough to sidestep the filibuster and pass a different bill from the ones proposed so far.\", \"\\u201cWherever the effort might end,\\u201d Nate Cohn has written, \\u201ca more realistic legislative push begins with an earnest effort to write a bill that is more responsive to the current threats to the system and is designed to win enough votes to pass.\\u201d\", \"The Biden administration should work with the Taliban to save lives, Laurel Miller argues.\", \"Stop talking with Russia and arm Ukraine, says Bret Stephens.\", \"A Joe Biden-Liz Cheney (or Kamala Harris-Mitt Romney) ticket in 2024 would help safeguard American democracy, Thomas Friedman argues.\", \"Melatonin: Many people are using it wrong.\", \"R.I.P.: Magawa the rat, who sniffed out land mines in Cambodia, has died.\", \"Sex after 70: Older couples are finding joy (and challenges) in intimacy.\", \"TikTok stardom: Juilliard rejected him.

They hoped for 50,000 attendees, and got more than 400,000. Lang died at 77.\", \"Amy Schneider \\u2014 the woman with the most consecutive \\u201cJeopardy!\\u201d victories \\u2014 won her 30th straight show last night.\", \"Schneider hasn\\u2019t been the only contestant on a roll \\u2014 long winning streaks have grown more common on the program.
