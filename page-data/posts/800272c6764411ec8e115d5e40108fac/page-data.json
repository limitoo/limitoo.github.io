The G.O.P. was damaged and internally at war, we had vaccines for the coronavirus that offered the prospect of a quick return to normalcy, and it seemed like the hoped-for \\u201cBiden boom\\u201d might create space for an ambitious progressive agenda.\", \"This was the atmosphere in which Biden\\u2019s expansive proposals earned him comparisons to Franklin Roosevelt, and in which his first Rooseveltian effort, the recovery bill, passed with surprising ease.\", \"But then came harsh reality: the Delta variant, the Afghanistan mess, the inflation spiral.\", \"And yet the early progressive expectations for a transformative presidency nevertheless endured \\u2014 they were palpable throughout the Build Back Better negotiations, and they remain evident in the rage against Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema.\", \"Thus the strategic argument for Biden\\u2019s recent maneuvers might be that he felt the need to go all the way with the progressive wing of his party, embrace their bombast and actively take their side against Manchin and Sinema \\u2014 all to prove to them that he had done what he could and the dream is dead for now, the Biden New Deal finished. Only after that knowledge can any sort of pivot to moderation or bipartisanship begin.\", \"As I said, this is the best theory I can come up with. But it\\u2019s still not a very good justification for Biden\\u2019s choices lately \\u2014 because going all the way with the more ideological faction in your party isn\\u2019t costless, and it makes any pivot back to moderation that much harder to ultimately make.\", \"We saw a version of this with the Build Back Better negotiations, where it was always clear that Manchin would get to name his price, and by the end his official ask \\u2014 a smaller bill that did a few things completely, rather than a lot of temporary spending \\u2014 was entirely reasonable (even if his preference for pre-K spending over the child tax credit was disappointing). Yet the White House seemed so committed to taking the progressive side and pushing the West Virginia moderate as hard as possible that it missed the obvious moment to make a deal \\u2014 when he literally wrote a $1.8 trillion offer \\u2014 and instead managed to shove him into truculent opposition.\", \"Now with election reform, the same pattern is repeating. The big voting rights proposals that Biden spent recent days championing began their life as a partisan messaging bill written to satisfy activists rather than designed to pass. Their core provisions were always unlikely to substantially affect turnout or election outcomes \\u2014 and they were also mostly orthogonal to the weak spots in the electoral system that Trump\\u2019s knavery attempted to exploit. So their foreordained failure should have been the prelude to negotiations on much narrower terrain \\u2014 a focused attempt to prevent election subversion, via a rewrite of the Electoral Count Act that some Republican senators seem willing to consider.\", \"But in making his push for the never-gonna-happen legislation, Biden went with rhetorical maximalism, accusing the legislators preventing its passage of siding with Bull Connor, George Wallace and Jefferson Davis. It was the liberal version of a George W. Bush-style \\u201cyou\\u2019re either with us, or you\\u2019re with the terrorists\\u201d flourish \\u2014 except designed in this case to slander figures, from Manchin to Mitt Romney, who would be essential to any future Biden-era deal making.\", \"Now in politics no enmity is permanent and no rhetoric unforgivable (just ask almost all of Donald Trump\\u2019s 2016 primary opponents), so I won\\u2019t tell you that Biden made future negotiations impossible this past week. Indeed in the case of Electoral Count Act reform I very much hope he didn\\u2019t.\", \"But generally politicians find reasons to forgive or forget when power forces them to do it, and power is what Biden conspicuously lacks right now. Which makes what we\\u2019ve just watched from him feel like the worst possible combination for a president \\u2014 an anger that only reveals weakness, an escalation that exposes only impotence beneath.\"]","href_hash":"800272c6764411ec8e115d5e40108fac"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"800272c6764411ec8e115d5e40108fac"}},
