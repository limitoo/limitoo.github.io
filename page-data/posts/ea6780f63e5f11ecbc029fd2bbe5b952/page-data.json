Historically, sea ice would have provided a resting area closer to their feeding grounds.\", \"\\\"Since 2007, during most years, sea ice has retreated northward beyond the continental shelf in the late summer and autumn, leaving Pacific walruses with no ice on which to rest between foraging bouts,\\\" the study states.\", \"The change in the distribution of sea ice has \\\"resulted in larger numbers coming ashore for longer periods on both the U.S. and Russian coasts of the Chukchi Sea.\\\"\", \"The study, titled Evaluation of Satellite Imagery for Monitoring Pacific Walruses at a Large Coastal Haulout, was published on October 23 in the journal Remote Sensing. Pictures can be found here and here.\", \"According to data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the average extent of Arctic sea ice has been decreasing at a rate of around 10 percent every decade since the early 1980s. NASA puts the figure at closer to 13 percent.\", \"The loss of sea ice is driven in part by something called ice-albedo feedback. White sea ice tends to reflect the vast majority of sunlight that hits it. The darker sea water, on the other hand, tends to absorb most of it.\", \"This means that the more the ice melts, the more this effect is pronounced in a pattern that reinforces melting.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927190/walruses-ice.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A file photo of a group of walruses on a chunk of ice in Russia.
