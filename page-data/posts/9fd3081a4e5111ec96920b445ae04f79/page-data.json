Especially as not everyone has a tax agent or accountant helping them,\\\" Cunniffe said.\", \"\\\"While the extension of the bright line test to 10 years might land well for most mum and dad property owners, the denial of interest deductions and how that relates to new builds is likely to be misunderstood.\\\"\", \"CA ANZ panned to make an oral submission about the matter to Parliament's Finance and Expenditure Committee on Monday.\"]","href_hash":"9fd3081a4e5111ec96920b445ae04f79"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9fd3081a4e5111ec96920b445ae04f79"}},
