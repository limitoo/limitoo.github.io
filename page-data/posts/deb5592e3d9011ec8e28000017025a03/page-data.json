(The scones and pastries are organic.)\", \"\\u201cSpencer,\\u201d described by its director, Pablo Larra\\u00edn, as \\u201ca fable from a true tragedy,\\u201d is all of the above, and also a fact-inspired drama about Diana, Princess of Wales, played with grit and grace by Kristen Stewart. Diana, who died in a car crash in 1997 \\u2014 and whose maiden name gives Larra\\u00edn\\u2019s film its title \\u2014 is hardly an obscure figure. A global celebrity and tabloid fixture in her lifetime, she remains somehow irresistible.\", \"Her troubled marriage to Prince Charles and her vexed relations with her royal in-laws have been subject to scrutiny from every angle, most recently in \\u201cThe Crown,\\u201d where she was played in the last season by Emma Corrin. (In the next one, Elizabeth Debicki will take up the role.) A superficial reading of \\u201cSpencer,\\u201d which takes place over three days (from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day) in 1991, might see it as a sidebar to \\u201cThe Crown,\\u201d lingering over a minor episode in a vast epic and isolating a single, relatively minor character amid the pomp and pageantry of palace life.\", \"That is exactly wrong. Larra\\u00edn and the screenwriter, Steven Knight, offer not a footnote but an ardent and unsparing rebuke to the mythical monarchist mumbo-jumbo that the Netflix series (to which I am entirely addicted) exists to promote. The conceit of \\u201cThe Crown\\u201d is that, for all their flaws, defeats and compromises \\u2014 or because of all that \\u2014 the members of the House of Windsor are fundamentally more interesting than anybody else. Their dilemmas are more exquisite, their choices more tragic, than anything the commoners can know.\", \"This is a persistent conceit in the literature of power, one that Larra\\u00edn, wielding his camera like a rapier and Jonny Greenwood\\u2019s lacerating score like a stiletto, leaves in tatters. The only members of the royal family whose voices are heard in \\u201cSpencer\\u201d are Charles (Jack Farthing) and his mother (Stella Gonet). Queen Elizabeth is as bland and cold as a dish of old porridge. Her eldest son, at least with Diana, is callous and cruel, mocking her eating disorder and lecturing her on the necessity of keeping up appearances.\", \"\\u201cThere have to be two of you,\\u201d he says \\u2014 one for \\u201cthe people\\u201d and one in private. (Like much of Knight\\u2019s script, these lines explain things a little too bluntly.) But one of the reasons Diana was called \\u201cthe people\\u2019s princess\\u201d was that she seemed always and authentically herself, an idea that Larra\\u00edn, Knight and Stewart implicitly endorse. She\\u2019s devoted to \\u201cwhat\\u2019s real,\\u201d and describes her tastes and interests, in a flawless aristocratic accent, as \\u201cmiddle class.\\u201d Fast food. Musical theater. Driving her European sports car instead of being chauffeured in a Rolls-Royce.\", \"She wants to be herself, and she wants to be free. Larra\\u00edn, who is Chilean, has made a handful of tough, unsettling films about life in his country under a military dictatorship determined to control the thought and behavior of its subjects. While \\u201cSpencer\\u201d hardly equates Queen Elizabeth with Pinochet, the power that the crown exerts over Diana can accurately be described as totalitarian.\", \"Preparations for Christmas at Sandringham House \\u2014 a moated mansion near the Norfolk coast \\u2014 have the character of a military operation. Groceries are delivered by armed soldiers, and the chief of the kitchen \\u201cbrigade\\u201d (Sean Harris) is like a field commander. (He\\u2019s also one of the few people in the castle who treats Diana with kindness). Everything is scheduled down to the minute: sandwiches, meals, hunting parties. Diana is instructed on which outfit she must wear for each activity.\", \"The dresses are tagged \\u201cP.O.W.\\u201d It stands for \\u201cPrincess of Wales,\\u201d of course. Still, Diana, in the midst of marital combat with Charles (who is having an affair with a briefly glimpsed, never named Camilla Parker-Bowles), is very much a prisoner. She glides through empty corridors and chambers under constant surveillance. Her every notion, whim and word is observed and reported. She is entirely alone, with no real privacy or solitude. Her only comfort is the company of her sons, William (Jack Nielen) and Harry (Freddie Spry).\", \"\\u201cSpencer\\u201d is, finally, a study in the psychological effects of captivity. Diana, fragile when she arrives at Sandringham \\u2014 and the subject of much \\u201cconcern\\u201d from the Windsors, spirals toward a breakdown over the next 72 hours. She hallucinates the ghost of Anne Boleyn, pierces the skin on her arm with a wire-cutter and acts out in ways that alarm her children and disgust the prince.\", \"Watching over her with sympathy \\u2014 though not necessarily on her side \\u2014 are two members of the royal staff. Major Gregory (Timothy Spall) tries to reason her into compliance, at one point telling a hair-raising story about his military service that is apparently meant to emphasize the importance of duty. Diana\\u2019s favorite dresser, Mary (Sally Hawkins), is a more steadfast ally, a sympathetic ear and then something more.\", \"\\u201cSpencer\\u201d is a companion piece to \\u201cJackie,\\u201d Larra\\u00edn\\u2019s 2016 film about Jacqueline Kennedy in the aftermath of her husband\\u2019s assassination. Both movies examine the isolation and paranoia of a woman at the mercy of political forces and family interests beyond her control, and turn on the heroine\\u2019s attempt at resistance. \\u201cSpencer\\u201d seems to me the more coherent film, partly because the directness of Stewart\\u2019s performance stands out so poignantly against the moral vacuity and aesthetic constipation of her surroundings.\", \"Stewart leverages her own star power to turn Diana into someone familiar. The intimacy and care the character craves is something the audience feels compelled to supply. Our sympathy is more than pity, and \\u201cSpencer\\u201d is more than the portrait of a woman in distress. If it\\u2019s a fable, it\\u2019s a political fable, an allegory of powerlessness, revolt and liberation.\"]","href_hash":"deb5592e3d9011ec8e28000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"deb5592e3d9011ec8e28000017025a03"}},
