He's had six wins and one draw.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The next player below him is an international master and he only has five points out of seven. That's a good score, but significantly behind the leader.\\\"\", \"Metge played on the lower board in the competition. He plays as an intellectual pursuit for fun, joining his first chess club in 1970 in Auckland when he was 13 and hasn't looked back. Players are now considerably younger than they were back then.\", \"\\\"We have loads of players in New Zealand who are playing below the ages of 10, so we now play age groups.\\\"\", \"There are a number child proteges competing in New Zealand, he said.\", \"\\\"Your true proteges - I think Bobby Fisher was one of the youngest masters even when he was 15. But now the youngest grand master in the world was an Indian boy at 12 years old, that's pretty impressive.\\\"\", \"Fears that chess has become mechanical with the advent of computer optimisation and 'played-out' are unfounded, he said. The game may be even more interesting now, with undiscovered moves, than ever before.\", \"\\\"Every generation seems to think the game has been been played out. The computers, especially these fantastic neural network machines - there's one called Alpha Zero - have actually shown that there's more to discover.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"There are new ideas that humans haven't discovered yet. So instead of it killing the game, I think it energised the game.\\\"\", \"The recent chess world championships, won by Magnus Carlsen of Norway, proved how exciting the game can still be, he said.\", \"\\\"The first six games were very, very even and Magnus won the sixth in a record number of moves and played a beautiful, nearly perfect kind of game and after that his opponent kind of collapsed. I think there's plenty of life left in chess.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"039c1530712011ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"039c1530712011ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
