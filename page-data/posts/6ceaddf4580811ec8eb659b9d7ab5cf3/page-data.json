Today we\\u2019ll meet the sheriff who charged former Gov. Andrew Cuomo with a misdemeanor sex crime. We\\u2019ll also see a piano that Thomas Edison sank his teeth into.\", \"Craig Apple Sr. \\u2014 who as the sheriff of Albany County, N.Y., filed a criminal complaint against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo \\u2014 is known among some fellow Democrats as the \\u201cTeflon sheriff\\u201d for navigating through trouble that might sink a less adept politician.\", \"But never has he found himself in water as rough as what he has had to traverse since he charged Cuomo with a misdemeanor sex crime in October. Three of my colleagues \\u2014 Dana Rubinstein, Grace Ashford and Jane Gottlieb \\u2014 write that Cuomo and his associates have dismissed Apple as a \\u201ccowboy sheriff\\u201d and accused him of harboring old grudges. Hoping to undermine Apple\\u2019s integrity, they have also publicized an audio recording in which Apple was heard saying, \\u201cI know how to manipulate the law and I\\u2019ve gotten pretty good at it.\\u201d\", \"The recording originally surfaced when Apple was running for sheriff in 2011. He sailed on to victory and has run for re-election \\u2014 unopposed \\u2014 not once but twice since.\", \"\\u201cI would say even Andrew Cuomo when he was on top of his game would find it difficult to discredit our sheriff,\\u201d said Matthew Miller, a Democratic county legislator and high school biology teacher in Selkirk, not far from where Apple grew up. \\u201cHe has a reservoir of good will.\\u201d\", \"[The Sheriff Who Wants to Put Andrew Cuomo Behind Bars]\", \"One reason is he has a progressive record that is unusual for a county sheriff. He turned a little-used wing of the jail into dormitory-style housing for homeless individuals and he arranged medically assisted treatment for inmates with opioid addictions. And as coronavirus cases exploded last winter, his office provided rapid Covid-19 tests and vaccines, a move he said was made possible by the \\u201cstrong support of the governor\\u2019s chamber\\u201d \\u2014 when Cuomo was governor.\", \"The complaint against Cuomo was based on the account of Brittany Commisso, a former executive assistant to Cuomo. She was one of the dozen or so women whose accusations of sexual harassment against Cuomo formed the basis of a state attorney general\\u2019s report that eventually led to his resignation in August \\u2014 the same month in which she went to the sheriff\\u2019s office.\", \"Cuomo\\u2019s allies have suggested that Apple coordinated the timing of the charge with the state attorney general, Letitia James, who announced her candidacy for governor a day after the charge against Cuomo became public. No evidence of coordination has emerged.\", \"He has also faced criticism from the Albany district attorney, David Soares, who has yet to say whether he will prosecute the case. Soares \\u2014 who sought and was granted a delay in Cuomo\\u2019s arraignment, which was pushed to January \\u2014 said Sheriff Apple had engaged in \\u201ctroubling\\u201d investigative methods and hidden potentially \\u201cexculpatory\\u201d evidence.\", \"Apple denied speculation that submitting the criminal complaint without involving Soares was a move to force the district attorney to prosecute.\", \"\\u201cListen, he\\u2019s the district attorney, he can do whatever he needs to do on this case,\\u201d Sheriff Apple said. \\u201cI mean, it\\u2019s totally up to him. It\\u2019s his prerogative. But I wouldn\\u2019t say that I boxed him in. I think that\\u2019s unfair.\\u201d\", \"Expect a chance of rain and snow on a mostly cloudy day with temps in the low 40s. The evening will be cloudy with temps in the 30s.\", \"Suspended today (Immaculate Conception).\", \"Thomas Edison dreamed up all those inventions everybody knows about. He also devised a singular method of taking in the sound from his piano. He bit the instrument as it was being played.\", \"Edison was so deaf that he would put his mouth on the piano and chomp down. This let him feel the vibrations of the sound.\", \"He apparently left his marks on at least one of his pianos \\u2014 a Steinway grand that he owned for not quite 40 years. It still has toothy little indentations.\", \"I remembered the story about gnawing the piano from \\u201cEdison,\\u201d the biography by Edmund Morris that was published in 2019. \\u201cI hear through my teeth,\\u201d Edison said. \\u201cI bite my teeth into the wood, and then I get it good and strong.\\u201d Morris wrote that this was \\u201cdifficult to do without slobbering\\u201d and that some of Edison\\u2019s phonographs \\u2014 he sank his teeth into them, too \\u2014 \\u201clooked as if they had been savaged by an enormous rodent.\\u201d\", \"Edison paid $725 for the Steinway, a Model B, in June 1890. Like many pianos from that era, it has only 85 keys. Steinway stopped making Model Bs with 85 notes in 1892, a year after it had added an 88-note version, the forebear of the Model B that is still in its product lineup.\", \"Edison\\u2019s piano was sold in 1929 and changed hands a few times over the years. Its current owner \\u2014 Robert Friedman, who after more than 40 years in the piano business calls himself \\u201cthe Steinway hunter\\u201d \\u2014 bought it in January, unseen, unplayed and unaware.\", \"It was unseen and unplayed because he was in Florida and it was in an estate sale on Long Island.\", \"He was unaware of how Edison had coped with his deafness. He knew only that the piano had once belonged to Edison \\u2014 there was paperwork to establish its provenance. He said he paid just under $45,000 \\u2014 far more than if its past had not included Edison, he said \\u2014 and sent it to a piano technician in Yonkers, N.Y., to re-regulate the hammers, \\u201cto get it playing nicer.\\u201d\", \"No one told him that the lock rail, the strip of wood above the keys, looked a bit battered.\", \"Friedman mentioned his purchase to his friend Charles Frommer, a musician and Edison aficionado who has a collection of Edison phonographs. When Frommer stopped by to tune it for Friedman, \\u201che stood over the piano and he looked down and said, \\u2018Those are Edison\\u2019s bite marks,\\u2019\\u201d Friedman said. \\u201cIt almost felt like Edison was in the room.\\u201d\", \"I can\\u2019t say that I felt Edison\\u2019s presence when I visited Friedman the other day in New Paltz, N.Y., and asked if he had listened to the piano the way Edison did. He obligingly bit down after Frommer slipped a small piece of wood over the bite marks so that Friedman\\u2019s teeth did not touch them.\", \"\\u201cI could feel the tone,\\u201d Friedman reported after playing a few notes. He called the sensation \\u201cweird,\\u201d saying it felt \\u201ckind of like your whole head was a tuning fork.\\u201d\", \"Friedman has not had the bite marks tested for DNA \\u2014 who knows if any of Edison\\u2019s genetic material remains?\", \"But his wife, Ronnie Rosenberg-Friedman, had no doubts.\", \"\\u201cI used to be a dental hygienist,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThose are definitely incisors.\\u201d\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"On a crisp Bronx afternoon, I prepared our 3-week-old son for his first neighborhood outing, nestling him in his carriage, swaddled in two blankets and a padded snowsuit with matching scarf and mittens.\", \"We shared the elevator down to the lobby with a neighbor who was meeting our son for the first time. The woman, herself a mother of three, smiled sweetly.\", \"\\u201cYour baby is too warm and overheated,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAt least take off one of those blankets.\\u201d\", \"Imagining my baby sweating uncontrollably, I thanked the woman, took off a blanket and loosened his scarf.\", \"I had almost made it through the lobby to the front door when we encountered another neighbor. She smiled at my son, and then gave me a disapproving look.\", \"\\u201cOh no, your sweet baby will freeze,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe needs another blanket, and that scarf has to be snug around his neck!\\u201d\", \"Too stunned to reply, I smiled at her as the taxi she was waiting for pulled up.\", \"I looked at my baby sleeping peacefully, pushed open the lobby door and let the brisk, wintry-fresh air envelop us as we took our first stroll together.\", \"\\u2014 Roberta Friedman\", \"Illustrated by Agnes Lee.
