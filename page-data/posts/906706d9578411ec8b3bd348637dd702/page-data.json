Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro described the fuel leak as a \\\"horrible, horrible tragedy,\\\" while Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday said that the situation was \\\"completely and totally unacceptable.\\\"\", \"The Navy announced in a statement Friday that testing of a well near the fuel facility detected petroleum in the water. The well had been isolated since the start of the week, the Navy said, but the discovery prompted both Hawaii Governor David Ige and the state Department of Health to ask the Navy to immediately shut down the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility.\", \"\\\"Test results confirming contamination of drinking water at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam show that the Navy is not effectively operating the World War II-era facility,\\\" Ige and the state's congressional delegation said on Twitter. \\\"We are calling for the Navy to immediately suspend operations at Red Hill while they confront and remedy this crisis.\\\"\", \"Ingesting, inhaling or other exposure to petroleum can result in vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and confusion.
