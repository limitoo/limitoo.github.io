lot of hope \\u2026 especially if you resonate with the writer, when the reader can see themselves in their story or connect with somebody\\\".\", \"Certain books were so compelling that Ms Colquitt would stick notes on herself and around her cell with life-changing quotes.\", \"Dante's Inferno was one of countless books Ms Colquitt recalled impacting her.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Finding

prison library.\", \"It was a job she loved, but one that she also said \\\"made her so mad\\\", observing the limited access women had to the library.\", \"Ms Colquitt said they went from having about five staff in the education department to one, which meant the library was only open for short periods of time.\", \"Lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic restricted library access even further, making access to reading material even more vital.\", \"\\\"[It highlights] the massive lack of engagement and programs in the justice system right now, especially due to COVID,\\\" she

rehabilitation system was too focused on employment.\", \"She said there was a strong focus on training and job-readiness, but a failure to consider how employment can be maintained without focusing on internal problems.\", \"\\\"We see it in the women with lived experience, it's the same story over and over,\\\" she said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Freadom Inside</div>\", \"A new initiative
