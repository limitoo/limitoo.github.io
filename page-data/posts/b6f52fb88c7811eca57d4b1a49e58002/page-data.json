In the United States, it is Eileen Gu. In the Olympics, it translates to big ticket item.\", \"She's the American-born athlete representing\\u00a0China, an 18-year-old who refers to herself as American when she's in America and Chinese when she's in China. That's dynamite in the current politically charged climate engulfing US-China relations.\", \"The freestyle skier competing in her first Olympics is also a straight 'A' student heading to Stanford in September, with an international modelling contract and endorsements currently worth around $US22 million ($30.8 million) a year.\", \"Dubbed the 'Snow Princess', you can't quite escape her, even when she's not competing.

I am an 18-year-old girl out here living my best life.\", \"\\\"Like, I am having a great time.
