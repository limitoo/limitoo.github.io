He had traveled to the German capital following a trip to Kyiv, Ukraine to meet with German, French and British counterparts. \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"\\\"These are difficult issues we are facing, and resolving them won't be done quickly. I don't expect we'll solve them in Geneva tomorrow,\\\" he said of the talks with Lavrov. \\\"But we can advance our mutual understanding \\u2013 and that, combined with de-escalation of Russia's military build-up on Ukraine's borders, that can turn us away from this crisis in the weeks ahead.\\\" \\u00a0\", \"The secretary's remarks came as Pentagon officials warned that a Russian invasion may not initially unfold with tanks rolling into Ukraine, but rather, in the form of hybrid measures like cyberattacks, information operations, sabotage or air strikes \\u2014 any of which \\\"could begin within days\\\" and allow Putin an opportunity to gauge the international reaction, one U.S. official said. \\u00a0\", \"The U.S. has also approved third-party transfers for NATO partners and allies, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom, to provide U.S. military equipment from their inventories for use by Ukraine, according to a State Department official. Recently the U.S. also authorized up to $200 million more in additional equipment support \\\"to meet Ukraine's emergency defense needs,\\\" the official said.\", \"In Washington, President Biden sought to walk back comments he made at a\\u00a0press conference\\u00a0Wednesday that suggested there could be divisions among Western nations about the consequences Russia could face if it launched a \\\"minor incursion\\\" into Ukrainian territory. \\u00a0\", \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine alluded to the comment in a tweet in English reading, \\\"We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones. I say this as the President of a great power.\\\"\", \"Mr. Biden, in an apparent effort to clarify his comments, said that he had been \\\"absolutely clear\\\" with Mr. Putin and that the Russian president had \\\"no misunderstanding\\\" that if \\\"any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that's an invasion.\\\" \\u00a0\", \"Such an incursion \\\"will be met with severe and coordinated economic responses\\\" that the president said he had discussed in detail with allies and laid out \\\"very clearly\\\" for Putin himself. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"Let there be no doubt at all that, if Putin makes this choice, Russia will pay a heavy price,\\\" Mr. Biden said, adding that the U.S. was prepared to address situations other than overt military action, including paramilitary tactics and cyberattacks. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"We have to be ready to respond to these as well,\\\" the president said. \\u00a0\", \"Asked if a small incursion by Russia would trigger sanctions, a senior Biden administration official also told reporters Wednesday, \\\"If Russia uses conventional military to acquire land forcibly, that will merit severe economic response.\\\"\", \"\\u00a0\\\"We said previously 'invasion is an invasion.' That's what we mean by that \\u2014 whether it's a small portion of territory or a large portion of territory,\\\" the same official added.\", \"David Martin, Eleanor Watson, Margaret Brennan and Camilla Schick contributed to this report.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"3f9e22087a3a11ec9d99c18cdba081f0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3f9e22087a3a11ec9d99c18cdba081f0"}},
