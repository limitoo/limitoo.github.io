sharks.\\u00a0\", \"Perth-based Rpela became\\u00a0the second company in the Australian market with a shark deterrent for surfers ($499) that has proven scientific efficacy, after the Journal of Marine Science and Technology published a study proving its product could significantly reduce the chance of an attack.\", \"The other is Ocean Guardian's Shark Shield Technology, which has a product\\u00a0for surfers ($579-$589) and divers ($649), for which the state government provides rebates of $200 for WA residents, deducted from the sale price by the retailer.\", \"Both devices work by\\u00a0creating an electric field designed to disrupt the sharks\\u2019 electro-reception organs.\", \"The devices are integrated into a surfboard, while Ocean Guardian's dive version straps around the ankle.\\u00a0\", \"Dave Smith, the founder of Rpela, hopes\\u00a0to have his product subsidised.\", \"Despite the added competition, Ocean Guardian chief executive Lindsay Lyon,\\u00a0believed having another proven product on the market would have upsides.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The problem the product category has had is convincing consumers that these devices really, really do work,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"I think it's a good thing.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Which is better?</div>\", \"The two devices are difficult to compare, as they were tested using different metrics.\\u00a0\",

chance of interacting with a shark by 38 per cent.\", \"The Ocean Guardian technology was found to reduce the chance of a white shark taking a surfboard-mounted bait from 96 per cent to 40 per cent, according to a study published by the New South Wales Government in 2018.\", \"Dr Dan Gaughan, from the WA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development, said there was a rigorous set of criteria any device would need to meet\\u00a0before being\\u00a0approved by government.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How are products tested?\\u00a0</div>\", \"Colby Bignell, an independent researcher, said it was difficult to test deterrents\\u00a0in a way that would simulate a real-world interaction between a shark and surfer.\\u00a0\", \"<img

boards, and researchers noted differences in shark behaviour between boards carrying active devices versus dummies.\", \"But he said the study had limitations, noting it was\\u00a0tricky to get a large sample size of white sharks.\\u00a0\", \"One reason they chose to do the study off the coast of Esperance, a natural white shark hotspot, was to\\u00a0use minimal bait, replicating real-world conditions as close as possible.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Studies difficult to design</div>\", \"Personal shark deterrents have been viewed with scepticism by some, particularly over claims they attract\\u00a0sharks.\", \"Mr Bignell said unless a shark was already very close, this was impossible with the two proven devices, as the electric field could only be detected at close range.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ac28428ff54eac6bb08385bd47e0b97b\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> While personal shark deterrents
