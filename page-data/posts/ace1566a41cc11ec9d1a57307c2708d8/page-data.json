The calculator asks for an aircraft model and flight distance in nautical miles as inputs.\", \"Using these inputs it calculates the emissions generated by the LTO (landing and take off) phases and the CCS (climb/cruise/descent) phases.\", \"Data analyst for Transport and Environment, Valentin Simon, told Fact Check that these phases generated emissions at different rates.\", \"\\\"Take-off and landing burn fuel much faster than during normal cruising, which is why an accurate calculator should consider the phases separately,\\\" he told Fact Check in an email.\", \"Other experts contacted by Fact Check agreed this tool was adequate to produce estimates of aviation emissions.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Rough calculations</div>\", \"As previously mentioned, Fact Check was unable to independently verify how many private jets arrived in Scotland or the UK for the purpose of transporting delegates to the summit.\", \"But using Mr Downer's claim of 400, some rough calculations can be made which can be compared with the magnitude of Scotland's annual emissions.\", \"The Daily Record claimed \\\"around 100 of the aircraft are believed to be carrying delegates from Europe \\u2014 with most round trips taking on average four hours \\u2014 while a further 300 long haul trips will clock up roughly 20 hours in the air.\\\"\", \"The article calculates that the 400 aircraft would emit 13,000 tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere ferrying delegates to and from the conference.\", \"However, this calculation appears to be a product of the average emissions of a private jet in the Transport and Environment report (which the article references) and the total number of hours in the air for the 400 jets which the article asserted were involved, which would give a solution of 12,800 metric tonnes.\", \"Mr Simon told Fact Check more accurate calculations could be made using distances matching the flight times in the EEA calculator.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f516ede101fc94fd2bb08635e94045a6\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The Cessna Citation Excel is a common short-range jet.(jetcraft.com)</div>\", \"He recommended using a Cessna Citation Excel (C550XL) for short-haul legs, assuming an average one-way trip of two hours, and a Bombardier Global Express (BD700) for long-haul legs, assuming an average one-way trip of 10 hours.\", \"As an exercise, Fact Check has used the Daily Record's splits of aircraft and average flight time to calculate the rough magnitude of emissions that would be generated from 400 flights.\", \"However, Gianmarco Andreana, a PhD student in applied economics and management at the University of Bergamo in Italy cautioned that the calculator could sum emissions on average, but did not account for the emissions of civil aviation aircraft like the US President's Air Force One.\", \"\\\"\\u2026 their emission values can largely differ from the one computed by any emissions calculator (different engines, weights, instruments, airframe, etc\\u2026). This means that using the value provided by an emissions calculator will, generally, underestimate their effective environmental footprint,\\\" he told Fact Check in an email.\", \"For a one-way journey lasting 2 hours on the Cessna model, the calculator predicts 3.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide would be emitted. One hundred of those journeys would emit 342.8 tonnes, while 100 return journeys would emit 685.7 tonnes.\", \"For a one-way journey lasting 10 hours on the Bombardier model, the calculator predicts 46.697 tonnes would be emitted. Three hundred of those journeys would produce 14,009.0 tonnes of carbon dioxide and the equivalent number of return journeys would produce 28,018.0 tonnes.\", \"Summed together, this would equal 14,351.8 tonnes for all the one-way trips.\", \"For return trips 28,703.6 tonnes would be emitted. However, it is unlikely that the bulk of the return journeys would be completed within the 24 hour time frame selected by Mr Downer.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How does this compare to Scotland's annual emissions?</div>\", \"By comparison, the Scottish government's\\u00a0most recent estimate of annual emissions\\u00a0puts the country's carbon output at 47.8 million tonnes (47,800,000) of carbon dioxide equivalent.\", \"This is over 3,000 times greater than the one-way journey estimates made by Fact Check.\", \"To put the comparison between Scotland's emissions and aviation emissions another way, if all\\u00a039,509 participants\\u00a0(provisionally estimated) attending the Glasgow conference each flew in their own Airbus A380 from Sydney, stopping in Dubai and then continuing on to Glasgow, these 39,509 individual one-stop, one-way journeys would generate approximately 33,554,586 tonnes of carbon dioxide, according to calculations made by Fact Check using the calculator.\", \"This would still not be enough to match Scotland's annual emissions output.\", \"This calculation is obviously absurd, but equally it demonstrates the absurdity of comparing 400 private jet journeys with the annual emissions of a country the size of Scotland.\", \"A study published in Global Environmental Change in 2019 calculated that the entire private jet sector emitted 33.7 million tonnes of carbon in 2016.\", \"Principal researcher: Online Editor Matt Martino\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Sources</div>\"]","href_hash":"ace1566a41cc11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ace1566a41cc11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
