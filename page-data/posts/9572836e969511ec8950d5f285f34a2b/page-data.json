That is the point when we can start to do things differently.\\\"\", \"RNZ's report has full details of her speech.\", \"Parliament was in recess this week but outside the building the protest against mandates, driven by numerous other grievances as well, maintained its noisy presence.\", \"National Party leader Christopher Luxon decided to enter the debate around it, first with a statement on Sunday and then a speech delivered just before Ardern's post-cabinet press conference.\", \"The Herald's Audrey Young said he was attempting to insert himself into the agenda as a unifying figure and criticised the way he went about it.\", \"\\\"Christopher Luxon's latest contribution to the occupation of Parliament grounds and the surrounding streets reeks of opportunism,\\\" Young said.\", \"\\\"'This is a situation entirely of the government's making,' he said on Sunday. Nobody believes that.\\\"\", \"She then quoted from his speech on Monday: \\\"We must chart a path to that middle ground that unites us, and not allow ourselves to be divided into warring factions, inextricably and increasingly opposed.\\\"\", \"Young saw that as \\\"an attempt to elevate the demands of the protesters to end vaccine mandates to some kind of groundswell in the broader population\\\".\", \"Luxon said the government should set out a plan to end mandates - \\\"that's my challenge to the government: 'You've got to do better than saying at some point they'll come to an end'.\\\"\", \"He said the mandates had caused \\\"real hardship and despair\\\".\", \"Responding to Luxon's comments about the country being divided Ardern said: \\\"I don't see differences in opinion as being a sign of widespread division. I do believe there is majority support for the way we are handling what is one of the hardest parts of the pandemic.\\\"\", \"And her response to his comments about protesters and mandates was to point out that all the parties in Parliament had signed a statement, released last week, saying none would engage with what was illegal activity.\", \"Luxon had come \\\"dangerously close to sympathy\\\" for the protesters, she said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/286641/eight_col_angus_%281%29.jpg?1644886911\\\" alt=\\\"Christopher Luxon and Jacinda Ardern serious face\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nNational leader Christopher Luxon said the government needed to set out a plan to end mandates as they had caused 'real hardship and despair', however Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said a majority of New Zealanders supported the government's handling of 'one of the hardest parts of the pandemic'. \\nPhoto: RNZ / Angus Dreaver\\n</div>\", \"National's leader came back on that: \\\"Just because you're criticising doesn't mean that I'm with the protesters - I've been rock solid with the government all the way through that and rejecting the protesters.\\\"\", \"Luxon said he should be able to criticise the government and say it should do a better job.\", \"One party leader who hadn't signed the statement was Winston Peters, and he got into the act as well.\", \"Peters visited the site and talked to the protesters, identified with them and said political leaders should be talking to them. They were reported to have swarmed around him, and he probably picked up a few NZ First votes.\", \"Peters didn't wear a mask - he could hardly have done so because they abuse anyone who does.\", \"Asked about that, Peters replied: \\\"The masks being offered these days, unless they're highly surgical masks of a certain scientific and medical content, are a waste of time.\\\"\", \"Auckland epidemiologist Rod Jackson took him on over that.\", \"\\\"Winston has no idea what he's talking about,\\\" Jackson told Newshub.\", \"\\\"N95 and equivalent masks are now widely available and you don't need a specialist to fit them.

The big question for New Zealand is how long it's going to take for that to happen.\", \"Hopefully Ardern got it right with her three to six weeks estimate.\", \"All this was happening against the backdrop of one of the most dangerous international situations in decades.\", \"Russia's invasion of Ukraine demanded a response and Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta gave it.
