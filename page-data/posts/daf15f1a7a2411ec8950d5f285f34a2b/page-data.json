You might feel relaxed and less stressed by experiencing yourself being in contact with nature.\", \"Nature offers us a respite from the daily grind of routines and demands.\", \"This innate desire to connect with our natural environments is labelled\\u00a0\\\"biophilia hypothesis\\\" \\u2014\\u00a0a term put forward by sociobiologist Edward Wilson in 1984.\", \"Research has found that spending time in natural settings is linked to:\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">So, time in nature does us good.

This is important for our survival and helps us better adapt to our surroundings.\", \"Stress Reduction Theory specifically focuses on how natural settings can reduce physiological stress and aversive emotion.
