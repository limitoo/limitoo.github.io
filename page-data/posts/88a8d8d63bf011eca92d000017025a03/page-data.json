Depicting basic public health measures as mask theater and \\u201cFaucian micromanagement\\u201d is misguided and counterproductive.\", \"I wear a mask not to shame any nearby anti-masker, but to keep myself safer from them, and to keep them safer from me. Full stop. We are looking at an ongoing plague of Covid precisely because so many people irrationally refuse to cooperate with very simple public health advice: wash hands frequently, socially distance and wear a mask when in indoor public places.\", \"When the Covid numbers drop drastically, I will drop my guard. I fear that it will be a long, long time before that day comes, however.\", \"Roberta RosenbergerMiami\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Deep blue states will need to put their egos and blinders aside to adapt to an endemic Covid world lest they become as deluded as the deep red states. Continuing over and above necessary precautions will serve only to increase anxiety, restrict activities, hamper children\\u2019s opportunities and otherwise resist normalcy.\", \"True, the stakes are lower for extreme blue behavior than red, as mask and vaccine refusal or denial can result in myriad health, economic and social repercussions. But do the deep blue states really want to live in a state of emergency for years to come to maintain a perceived moral and intellectual high ground?\", \"Full disclosure: I say this as a liberal, albeit a frustrated one, who wants to live in a (blue) state of near normalcy.\", \"Evan Elizabeth CampaNashville\", \"To the Editor:\", \"I live in red state, in a county with slightly over half of people vaccinated. I would welcome dealing with what Ross Douthat faces living in Connecticut. As a high school teacher, I interact with hundreds of students a day. Masks aren\\u2019t theater or shaming devices; they keep me, my students, my family and my friends safe.\", \"While my two teenage sons, my husband and I are all fully vaccinated, many in our community are not. As a result, people are still getting sick, some still dying, and hospitals and medical professionals still overwhelmed.\", \"On a personal level, I weigh every interaction to gauge risk: Is it dangerous to sit next to the unvaccinated person in a meeting? How do I advise my teenage sons to interact with their unvaccinated friends? In my classroom, how do I help a student with work when her mask is always falling down?\", \"Mr. Douthat\\u2019s column was much more provocative than constructive. I also wish that he had tried to show more empathy and understanding for the millions of Americans still dealing with Covid every day, particularly those of us who are doing our best to live with, work with and be compassionate toward those with whom we disagree.\", \"Cathy Montgomery SparksChesterton, Ind.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Given that there have already been more deaths from Covid-19 in the United States in 2021 than there were in 2020, Ross Douthat\\u2019s lament about deep blue states lagging in getting to a post-Covid normalcy seems wildly premature. Rather than berating the caution of the deep blues, perhaps an article for deep reds encouraging more precautions could actually serve to help us get to that post-Covid normalcy that we all (blue and red) crave.\", \"Melody FosterPetaluma, Calif.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cHere\\u2019s a Hot Stock Tip: Invest More Like a Woman,\\u201d by Ron Lieber (Your Money column, Business, Oct. 30):\", \"As soon as I read this article I sent it to one of my oldest friends, a high school pal. For the last few months her husband has been teaching her how to trade online, which he\\u2019s done for years.\", \"We\\u2019re all in our 80s, and I\\u2019m enormously impressed that at this stage in life she\\u2019s taken on this challenge.\", \"When my husband and I retired, we divided tasks according to our talents. He took over cooking and technology; I handled the finances and paperwork. It worked out very well, other than that when he died I had to learn how our new oven and computer worked. But our finances and paperwork were in great shape.\", \"Carol A. HubertPrescott, Ariz.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cA Racial Disparity in Schizophrenia Diagnoses in Nursing Homes\\u201d (The Upshot, Oct. 17):\", \"As your article explains, Black older adults receive worse care in nursing home settings, just as we do in all health care settings. But if elder care for Black people is bad in the community, imagine how we are treated in prison.\", \"The kind of control achieved through misuse of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes is just one of the tools used behind bars. Senior incarcerated people suffering from age-related illnesses, such as dementia and hearing impairments, are routinely punished because they don\\u2019t respond to a \\u201cdirect order\\u201d quickly enough.\", \"Some have been placed in solitary confinement and had their wheelchairs, walkers or canes confiscated as punishment. Physical abuse of seniors in prison is not uncommon. Prison-based regional medical units for the terminally ill are rife with neglect. As prison populations have slowly declined, older people serving long sentences have largely been left behind, so there is a worsening crisis of aging, sickness and lonely deaths in New York, as in other states.\", \"To protect our elders from the horrors of growing old behind bars, policymakers must act to provide meaningful release opportunities, including by passing the elder parole bill here in New York State.\", \"Jose SaldanaBronxThe writer is director of the Release Aging People in Prison Campaign.\"]","href_hash":"88a8d8d63bf011eca92d000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"88a8d8d63bf011eca92d000017025a03"}},
