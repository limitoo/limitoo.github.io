The agency oversees HealthCare.gov.\", \"Millions of people got extra help paying for health coverage this year, and the expanded financial assistance will continue next year. But it\\u2019s still wise to actively re-enroll and update your information, health care experts say, to make sure you\\u2019re getting the best coverage at the best price.\", \"And if you lack coverage but haven\\u2019t shopped on the marketplace before because you didn\\u2019t think you could afford it, you may be surprised to find that you now qualify for plans at much lower costs because of the expanded pandemic subsidies.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s especially important for folks to come back and look again,\\u201d said Katie Keith, a consultant and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law School, where she teaches courses on health law and policy. \\u201cThis is a whole new ballgame.\\u201d\", \"Back in the spring, the Affordable Care Act survived a legal challenge before the Supreme Court. That effort, the latest in a series of Republican attempts to dismantle the program also known as Obamacare, had cast uncertainty over the act\\u2019s future. But the law now appears to be here to stay.\", \"Marketplace enrollment reached a \\u201crecord high\\u201d of 12.2 million people after a special pandemic enrollment period ended in August, the Kaiser Family Foundation found.\", \"This time around, the millions of marketplace shoppers can generally expect lower premiums, more choice in health plans and more robust subsidies that will reduce costs \\u2014 at least for next year, said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation who studies health care reform.\", \"Most states are served by HealthCare.gov, where premiums for a \\u201cbenchmark\\u201d silver plan for 2022 will be about 3 percent lower, on average, than this year, according to a report from the federal government. (Plans are designated by metal levels. Bronze plans generally have the lowest monthly premiums, and the premiums get progressively higher with silver, gold and platinum plans.) Tax credits that reduce the cost of premiums are calculated based on the cost of the benchmark silver plan, which can change from year to year.\", \"In some state-based marketplaces, premiums may increase \\u201cmodestly\\u201d on average, Kaiser said. Seventeen states \\u2014 including Kentucky, Maine and New Mexico, which added their own exchanges this year \\u2014 and the District of Columbia run their own marketplaces.\", \"On average, the government said, people in HealthCare.gov states will have a choice of more than 80 health plans, up from an average of 46 plans this year.\", \"Most significant, however, is that under the American Rescue Plan Act, financial help for health coverage has been expanded for this year and next for both lower- and middle-income people.\", \"The dollar amount of premium tax credits has risen, and they now cover the full cost of enrolling in a benchmark plan for people with incomes up to 150 percent of the federal poverty level \\u2014 about $19,000 for a single person, and $33,000 for a family of three, according to a Kaiser analysis. That means families at that income level can get premium-free silver plans. Before, they had to pay more than 4 percent of household income for a benchmark plan.\", \"In the past, plans with low premiums often had significant deductibles \\u2014 the amount paid out of pocket, before insurance started paying \\u2014 which discouraged some people from enrolling, Ms. Pollitz said. \\u201cNow, there are zero-premium plans with low deductibles, and that really is significant,\\u201d she said.\", \"The pandemic aid law also expanded eligibility for premium help to people with higher incomes \\u2014 over 400 percent of the poverty level ($51,520 for a single person, and about $88,000 for a family of three). Now, those families won\\u2019t have to contribute more than 8.5 percent of their income. Previously, such plans could easily cost more than 20 percent of income for older people because premiums are based on a person\\u2019s age, Ms. Pollitz said.\", \"Negotiations are underway in Congress to extend the expanded financial help beyond next year, but the outlook remains unclear. \\u201cFor now, you only need to worry about 2022,\\u201d Ms. Pollitz said.\", \"Also next year, a new federal law takes effect that aims to reduce surprise medical bills. Starting Jan. 1, all insurance plans \\u2014 including marketplace plans \\u2014 must cover emergency care at a plan\\u2019s in-network rate, and out-of-network emergency rooms and doctors can\\u2019t bill patients for more than what they would pay in-network under their health plan. The protections also cover routine care, in situations where a patient receives care at an in-network hospital from a doctor who isn\\u2019t in the network.\", \"Here are some questions and answers about open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act:\", \"For states that use HealthCare.gov, open enrollment started Nov. 1 and runs through Jan. 15. But if you want coverage to start on Jan. 1, you should enroll by Dec. 15. Many of the states that run their own exchanges offer longer open enrollment periods, but two \\u2014 Idaho and Minnesota \\u2014 end earlier, on Dec. 15.\", \"Open enrollment is the best time to sign up for coverage, but starting next year, people with low incomes \\u2014 up to about $19,000 for a single person and about $33,000 for a family of three \\u2014 will have more flexibility to enroll in A.C.A. plans throughout the year. The change is expected to benefit millions of people.\", \"You can also qualify for a special enrollment period if you lose your job-based coverage, have a child or experience other life changes.\", \"After years of cutting funding, the federal government has restored support for \\u201cnavigators,\\u201d trained enrollment advisers who provide free help to people seeking coverage through HealthCare.gov. The Biden administration said there are more than 5,500 \\u201cassisters,\\u201d including navigators and other certified counselors, and 48,000 agents and brokers who can guide shoppers through their options. Contact information can be found on HealthCare.gov or by calling 800-318-2596.\"]","href_hash":"33d45d283e3c11ec8dbe4731545c1f8c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"33d45d283e3c11ec8dbe4731545c1f8c"}},
