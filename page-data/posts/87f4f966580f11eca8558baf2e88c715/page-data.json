Ms. Treasure said she specifically recommended that the T. rex wear a Christmas jumper \\u2014 a garish staple of the holiday season that self-deprecating Britons have come to embrace.\", \"The entire process of knitting a sweater that would fit a dinosaur took about 100 hours to complete, she said. Mr. Patel said the first sweater was too large. Getting a turtleneck over the head of the dinosaur was also a problem, said Mr. Patel, who recalled trying to push and pull the material on.\", \"They ultimately decided to add a zipper to the sweater\\u2019s back. During the fitting process, museum technicians were on hand to pause the T. rex\\u2019s movements while Mr. Patel and his staff measured the dinosaur using large step ladders and extra-long measuring tape.\", \"On Monday, Mr. Patel and his employees arrived early at the museum to put the finishing touches on the sweater, which measured nearly four feet around the neck, nine and a half feet around the shoulders and just over 10 feet around the body.\", \"On Twitter, images of the T. rex in the sweater met with gleeful reactions.\", \"\\u201cMost heartwarming news story of the year,\\u201d one person wrote.\", \"\\u201cThe Jurassic Park / Home Alone crossover looks excellent,\\u201d wrote Michael Moran, a British tabloid journalist.\", \"On the museum\\u2019s Instagram account, photos of the dinosaur in the jumper had more than 23,000 likes.\", \"\\u201cThis is the thing I never knew I needed in my life until this exact moment,\\u201d one Instagram user wrote in reply to the photos.\", \"The sweater will stay on the T. rex until Christmas Eve.\", \"Mr. Patel said he expected to get the sweater back. It will then be shredded into material that can be reused for something different, like carpet underlay. But Ms. Treasure said she was hopeful that the sweater could be converted into another product that could be donated to charity.\", \"Mr. Patel said that after successfully styling an animatronic dinosaur, he felt equipped to outfit other massive animal displays with Christmas sweaters.\", \"\\u201cIf the New York museum wants to do something next year,\\u201d he said, referring to the American Natural History Museum, \\u201cwe are ready.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"87f4f966580f11eca8558baf2e88c715"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"87f4f966580f11eca8558baf2e88c715"}},
