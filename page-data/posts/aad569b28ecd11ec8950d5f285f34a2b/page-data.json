It took out a lot of power; a lot of trees came down over power wires and stuff, and a lot of orchards got sort of pretty wrapped around, especially the young ones. Young gold kiwifruit orchards with poles up, all the poles have been knocked over.\", \"\\\"But that's horticulture, we'll get up and go again. It's not good, but that's life.
