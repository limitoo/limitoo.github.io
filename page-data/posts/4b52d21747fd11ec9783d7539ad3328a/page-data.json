He was 88.\", \"His wife, April Magnusson, confirmed the death.\", \"Mr. Frishberg, who also played piano and sang, was an anomaly, if not an anachronism, in American popular music: an accomplished, unregenerate jazz pianist who managed to outrun the eras of rock, soul, disco, punk and hip-hop by writing hyper-literate songs that harked back to Hoagy Carmichael and Johnny Mercer, by way of Stephen Sondheim.\", \"His songwriting wit was for grown-ups, yet he reached his widest audience with sharpshooting ditties for kids as a regular musical contributor to ABC\\u2019s long-running Saturday morning television show \\u201cSchoolhouse Rock!\\u201d\", \"Merely being aware of Dave Frishberg and his songs conveyed an in-the-know sophistication. He poked fun at this self-congratulatory hipness in his lyrics for \\u201cI\\u2019m Hip,\\u201d a classic of clueless with-it-ness that he wrote to a melody by his fellow jazz songwriter Bob Dorough:\", \"Mr. Frishberg\\u2019s original lyric for \\u201cI\\u2019m Hip,\\u201d written in 1966, was \\u201cI read Playboy magazine,\\u201d but he later changed it.\", \"People magazine never did get around to profiling him (though it did briefly review one of his albums in the 1980s). But his niche in the niche-songwriting world of the cabaret smart set (when such a breed still existed) was lofty. Superb saloon singers came to be identified with the Frishberg tunes they sang. One of those singers was Blossom Dearie, whose rendition of his \\u201cPeel Me a Grape\\u201d was, in Mr. Frishberg\\u2019s view, definitive.\", \"Still, no one quite sang a Dave Frishberg song like Dave Frishberg, with his thin, reedy voice and compellingly constricted vocal range. Mr. Frishberg\\u2019s performance of his acerbic paean to \\u201cMy Attorney Bernie\\u201d was unsurpassed, particularly his laconic crooning of the song\\u2019s refrain:\", \"Mr. Frishberg\\u2019s songwriting gift extended well beyond the satirical jab. He composed some beautiful ballads, and he was an elegant nostalgist who wrote longingly (though also knowingly) about the mists of time and loss. There was the bittersweet Frishberg of \\u201cDo You Miss New York?,\\u201d the aching Frishberg of \\u201cSweet Kentucky Ham\\u201d and the ingeniously eloquent Frishberg of \\u201cVan Lingle Mungo,\\u201d a touching wisp of a ballad constructed solely from the strung-together names of long-ago major league baseball players.\", \"David Lee Frishberg was born on March 23, 1933, in St. Paul, Minn., the youngest of three sons of Harry and Sarah (Cohen) Frishberg. His father, who owned a clothing store, was an \\u00e9migr\\u00e9 from Poland; his mother was a native-born Minnesotan.\", \"He began sketching athletes from news photos when he was 7 and hoped to become a sports illustrator, but he also listened closely to music growing up and could sing the entire score of \\u201cThe Mikado\\u201d and other Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. His brother Mort, a self-taught blues piano player, soon steered him toward jazz and blues records, and to the keyboard, where the teenage Mr. Frishberg replicated by ear the boogie-woogie styles of Pete Johnson and Meade Lux Lewis before discovering the modernist pianism of bebop.\", \"\\u201cJazz musicians were hip,\\u201d Mr. Frishberg wrote in his memoir, \\u201cMy Dear Departed Past\\u201d (2017); \\u201cthey were funny, they were sensitive, they were clannish, and they seemed to have the best girlfriends.\\u201d\", \"After graduating from St. Paul Central High School, Mr. Frishberg briefly attended Stanford University before returning home to enroll at the University of Minnesota. Though he was already a semiregular on the local jazz scene, his sight reading skills were too poor for a formal music degree. Instead he flirted with majoring in psychology before gravitating to journalism and securing his degree in 1955.\", \"He served two years in the Air Force as a recruiter, to fulfill his R.O.T.C. obligations, and then, in 1957, was hired by the New York radio station WNEW to write advertising scripts and other material for its disc jockeys and announcers. He quickly forsook WNEW to write catalog copy for RCA Victor Records, then finally stepped out as a working solo pianist with a late-night slot at the Duplex cabaret in Greenwich Village.\", \"Mr. Frishberg became an in-demand sideman at jazz spots like Birdland and the Village Vanguard for jazz luminaries including the saxophonists Ben Webster, Al Cohn and Zoot Sims and the drummer Gene Krupa. He also accompanied an array of great singers, including Carmen McRae, Anita O\\u2019Day and, for one dizzying night while backing Ms. O\\u2019Day at the Half Note, a timid Judy Garland, who tremulously sat in and sang \\u201cOver the Rainbow,\\u201d then asked Mr. Frishberg to become her musical director. He demurred.\", \"In the early 1960s, Mr. Frishberg began writing songs \\u2014 \\u201call kinds of songs,\\u201d as he recalled in \\u201cMy Dear Departed Past.\\u201d When the singer Fran Jeffries asked if he could write her a bit of special material, something she could \\u201cslink around while singing,\\u201d he responded with \\u201cPeel Me a Grape\\u201d:\", \"Written in 1962, \\u201cPeel Me a Grape\\u201d became Mr. Frishberg\\u2019s first published tune \\u2014 though the publishing company that acquired it, Frank Music, owned by the illustrious Frank Loesser, did little with it. \\u201cAs far as I knew, the song was a pretty confidential item,\\u201d Mr. Frishberg later wrote, \\u201cuntil Blossom Dearie\\u2019s version.\\u201d Still, it launched Mr. Frishberg as a songwriter.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m Hip\\u201d followed in 1966, leading to a swelling portfolio of songs. The demos that he cut to teach his songs began to tickle the insular jazz recording industry\\u2019s ear. Finally, Mr. Frishberg went into the studio himself to record an album, consisting of his own compositions. The record was released in 1970 on the recently formed CTI label under the title \\u201cOklahoma Toad.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Frishberg decamped to Los Angeles in 1971, ostensibly to write material for \\u201cThe Funny Side,\\u201d a new NBC variety show starring Gene Kelly. The show lasted only nine episodes, but work as a studio musician kept Mr. Frishberg afloat. He also began to perform his songs regularly in local clubs.\", \"In 1975, Mr. Dorough invited him to contribute to \\u201cSchoolhouse Rock!,\\u201d for which Mr. Dorough was the musical director and one of the writers. Mr. Frishberg\\u2019s first contribution, in the show\\u2019s third season, was \\u201cI\\u2019m Just a Bill,\\u201d an explanatory swinger about the legislative process sung by the jazz trumpeter and vocalist Jack Sheldon. It brought him unexpected acclaim and long-lasting residuals for what he later ruefully acknowledged to be his \\u201cmost well-known song.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe Dave Frishberg Songbook, Volume No. 1\\u201d garnered a 1982 Grammy Award nomination for best male jazz vocal performance. The next year, \\u201cThe Dave Frishberg Songbook, Volume No. 2\\u201d did the same. In support of that album, Mr. Frishberg appeared on \\u201cThe Tonight Show.\\u201d Two more Frishberg albums were nominated for Grammys, \\u201cLive at Vine Street\\u201d in 1985 and \\u201cCan\\u2019t Take You Nowhere\\u201d in 1987.\", \"Mr. Frishberg\\u2019s marriage in 1959 to Stella Giammasi ended in divorce. He later married Cynthia Wagman.\", \"In 1986, he, his wife and their year-old son, Harry, moved to Portland, fleeing the freeway traffic and what he once referred to as the \\u201cmalignant environment\\u201d of Los Angeles. He lived on in Portland, more or less contentedly, for the rest of his life, producing a second son, Max; divorcing for a second time; and, in 2000, marrying Ms. Magnusson. In addition to her, he is survived by his sons.\", \"In Portland, he collaborated regularly with the vocalist Rebecca Kilgore. As often as not, though, Mr. Frishberg reveled in playing solo piano in crowded hotel bars. When ill health overtook him late in life, he never stopped writing, just as he had mordantly predicted in 1981 in \\u201cMy Swan Song\\u201d:\"]","href_hash":"4b52d21747fd11ec9783d7539ad3328a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4b52d21747fd11ec9783d7539ad3328a"}},
