The 2022 away jersey recodes the Blues' history\", \"The Highlanders design theme for 2022 was \\\"Heritage Remixed\\\".\", \"It is hoped the home, away and training jerseys will envoke a strong sense of nostalgia with the colour palette and pattern, as will the unique location chosen to launch these jerseys, Cargill's Castle.\", \"One of only two castles in New Zealand the structure stands proud on the cliffs above St Clair, resilent in the face of the unrelenting southerlies.\", \"All three jerseys carry a modernised tartan pattern over the left shoulder, tonal on both playing strips, to represent the many members of our organisation and wider community weaving together. This is a modern tartan design (almost digital in appearance) to acknowledge the modern face of our team and community and the changing environments in which we operate today.\", \"The dark blue home jersey has a sleek, tonal, embossed tartan representing our people south of the Waitaki; strong and understated. The away strip is representative of our wider region with the North Otago and Southland colours predominately used. Again the tonal modernised tartan design comes down over the left shoulder representing our tight knit region.\", \"The training jersey differs in that a contrasting tartan pattern is used. This design represents the environment on the training field; where players battle for the same position, constantly challenging and competing but ultimately weaving and working together towards a common purpose.\", \"The Chiefs new jersey designs are linked to the Chiefs region, wh\\u0101nau and M\\u0101ori heritage.\", \"The home jersey - 'Ng\\u0101 hihi o te r\\u0101 - The Rays of the Sun', draws on inspiration from Tamanuiter\\u0101 (The Sun). It uses ng\\u0101 hihi o te r\\u0101 (Sunrays) to accentuate the Chiefs home colours.\", \"The rays of Tamanuiter\\u0101 touch all parts of the Chiefs contributing unions radiating energy and power, depicted in the top half of the design.\", \"The lower k\\u014dwhaiwhai (ornate swirls) depict the flow of waterways throughout the region connecting the Chiefs wh\\u0101nau, sponsors, members, players, clubs and supporters.\", \"The away jersey - 'He Piringa P\\u0101ua' represents loyalty and allegiance. The jersey design utilises the vibrant colouring of the p\\u0101ua shell and is inspired by the M\\u0101ori axiom, 'Ka haere te p\\u0101ua ki te toka, he piringa p\\u0101ua - The p\\u0101ua will go to the rock and cling to it fiercely.' Denoting that even when the team plays away from home, they will always return just as the p\\u0101ua returns to the rock if dislodged.\", \"Like the home jersey, the flowing k\\u014dwhaiwhai (ornate swirls) represent connecting waterways which will always carry the team back home.\", \"The Hurricanes new home jersey pays homage to the iconic original Hurricanes jersey, whilst redefining the design with a fresh new aesthetic and detailing.\", \"\\\"Our jersey features a pattern inspired by our mighty winds, a source of our strength, reflecting both the traditional narrative from our region and our unstoppable momentum,\\\" said Hurricanes CEO, Avan Lee.\", \"\\\"The blue stripes are a throwback to the Hurricanes very first Super Rugby jersey. The blue stripe on the original jersey is iconic, so we are really pleased to see its return with a new modern take.\\\"\", \"The new training jersey sees a completely fresh approach from the Hurricanes. The Pasifika-inspired jersey is a vibrant representation of the Hurricanes Pasifika community, depicting coconut palms and frangipani flowers.\", \"\\\"This jersey is really special to us. We wanted it to reinforce what we are trying to do off the field, which is to celebrate and embrace the multi-cultural connections within our community. It will be great to see the guys wearing it in the lead-up to games throughout the season.\\\"\", \"The Crusaders new jersey is a reflection of the collective strength of our region. Its design draws on the strength of this unique place we call home. The six peaks representing the collective mana of our six provincial unions, Buller, Canterbury, Mid-Canterbury, South-Canterbury, Tasman and West-Coast.\", \"\\\"From the mountains, to the sea, we're bound by a common purpose, a shared goal to achieve great things. It's not about the individual mountainWhen we're united, we can't be moved. These mountain ranges don't divide us, they unite us and just like them, our diversity strengthens our team and our community.\", \"\\\"Brought together through the substance of our colours - M\\u0101 pango m\\u0101 whero, ka oti te mahi.
