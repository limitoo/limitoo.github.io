Minnesota currently has almost all of its hospital beds filled, making the two states current hotspots of the virus.\", \"Nationwide hospitalizations have stabilized around 40,000 in recent weeks, down from over 90,000 at the height of the Delta variant wave.\", \"Bob Riney, chief operating officer at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, said he hears front-line hospital workers disheartened at the rising numbers, especially as the majority of hospitalized patients are unvaccinated while the vaccines are easily available.\", \"In Minnesota, Health Director Jan Malcolm said she is prepared to expand access to booster shots to all adults over 18 instead of the current CDC recommendation of those at higher risk of COVID and those over 65.\", \"Arkansas recently joined California, Colorado and New Mexico in deciding to provide booster shot access as the holiday and winter season approaches, driving many people into their homes and closer to family more frequently.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1933989/covid-michigan-minnesota-vaccine.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">President Joe Biden delivers remarks on plans to stop the spread of the Delta variant and boost Covid-19 vaccinations at the State Dinning Room of the White House, in Washington, DC on September 9, 2021.</div>\", \"It \\\"should be alarming to all of us,\\\" Riney said of the hospital crush.\", \"Virus spread has slowed in the South to the point that more locations are doing away with mask restrictions.\", \"But pockets of the country are seeing surges, including the Northeast, Rockies and Upper Midwest.\", \"Henry Ford Health and Spectrum Health across the state in Grand Rapids, Michigan, together reported 700 COVID-19 patients in their hospitals, the majority of whom were not vaccinated.
