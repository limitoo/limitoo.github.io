It\\u2019s sung by church choirs and high school choruses. Versions have been recorded by Linda Ronstadt and Sting.\", \"But we have the early German Baroque composer Michael Praetorius to thank for the original single, so to speak: \\u201cEs ist ein Ros entsprungen.\\u201d The text and hymn melody were first printed together in 1599. But in 1609, Praetorius wrote a tender, four-part setting that plumbed the melody for all its harmonic possibilities, and became the equivalent in its day of a hit tune.\", \"On Saturday, at St. Paul\\u2019s Lutheran Church in Manhattan, the splendid ensemble Tenet Vocal Artists performed, with 14 exquisite singers and 11 vibrant players of period instruments, a ravishing account of the beautifully direct yet intricate Praetorius version, part of a generous 75-minute concert of this composer\\u2019s works.\", \"The program \\u2014 while Jolle Greenleaf is Tenet\\u2019s artistic director, this one was led by Jeffrey Grossman, who played organ \\u2014 honored the fact that this year marks both the 400th anniversary of Praetorius\\u2019s death and the 450th anniversary of his birth. (An on-demand video of the concert will be available for a month starting Tuesday at tenet.nyc.)\", \"Praetorius was a leading figure of the German Lutheran chorale tradition \\u2014 the practice of using hymn tunes as components of pieces that often unfold with striking complexity, as in the wondrous \\u201cNun komm, der Heiden Heiland,\\u201d which Tenet performed compellingly. On one level this music comes across as a multi-section, chorale-like setting of an alluring melody. But just below the surface the music teems with inner details: flourishes of offbeat counterpoint for the voices, squiggling riffs for the instruments.\", \"In the later phase of his career, Praetorius was increasingly influenced by new styles coming out of Italy, including the technique known as \\u201ccori spezzati,\\u201d in which groups of singers and players were divided into smaller ensembles so that phrases could be bounced back and forth.\", \"In this regard Praetorius was indebted to a younger German contemporary, Heinrich Sch\\u00fctz, whom he got to know when they both worked in Dresden. Sch\\u00fctz had studied in Venice for three years with a progenitor of the technique: Giovanni Gabrieli, the composer and organist at St. Mark\\u2019s Basilica. In a nod to the Sch\\u00fctz\\u2019s influence, Tenet began the program with his \\u201cJauchzet dem Herren,\\u201d in which mini-phrases are boldly echoed.\", \"That Praetorius brought his own take to the technique was amply demonstrated with a performance of four fleet dances for instruments from his collection \\u201cTerpsichore,\\u201d his only surviving secular music. The interplay went beyond echo effects; sometimes a flourish was tossed from one group to another with an open invitation to elaborate on it. In several of the large-scale choral works, the Tenet singers enhanced the dramatic impact of the cori spezzati passages by positioning themselves well apart from one another in the church.\", \"The revelation, for me, was a performance of the lengthy \\u201cVater unser im Himmelreich,\\u201d from Praetorius\\u2019s 1619 collection \\u201cPolyhymnia Caduceatrix\\u201d \\u2014 magnificent music, laid out in multiple sections, with sublime stretches of overlapping counterpoint and plush harmonies that cadence into radiant consonance. Historians point to this score as the German Baroque counterpart to Monteverdi\\u2019s seminal Vespers of 1610.\", \"Yet some of the more modest fare was just as rewarding, like the setting of what\\u2019s familiar today as the carol \\u201cJoseph Dearest, Joseph Mine.\\u201d How often do you get to hear Praetorius\\u2019s subtly ingenious and glowing version?\"]","href_hash":"deeba3105c3c11ec853567c23f08d115"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"deeba3105c3c11ec853567c23f08d115"}},
