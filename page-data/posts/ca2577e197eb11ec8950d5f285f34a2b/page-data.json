Most are in Auckland hospitals, although 34 people with Covid-19 are in Waikato Hospital.\", \"The Ministry said 9046 of the cases reported today were in Auckland.\", \"The rest of cases were reported in the Northland (225), Waikato (1,519), Bay of Plenty (812), Lakes (208), Hawke's Bay (136), MidCentral (142), Whanganui (19), Taranaki (100), Tair\\u0101whiti (69), Wairarapa (45), Capital and Coast (516), Hutt Valley (373), Nelson Marlborough (158), Canterbury (981), South Canterbury (44), Southern (532) and West Coast (9) DHBs.\", \"The Ministry noted today that a large proportion of recent cases are under 30 years of age.\", \"\\\"In the past fortnight, of the 14,940 cases reported, 59 percent have been under 30 years of age and 12 percent over the age of 50. The two age groups with the highest percentage of cases are people aged between 10-19 years of age and those aged between 20-29 which account for 25 percent and 25 percent of cases respectively.\\\"\", \"But it said the opposite pattern was seen in those who are in hospital with Covid-19.\", \"\\\"Of the current 236 patients with Covid-19 in hospital in the Northern region, there are 19 percent who are under the age of 30 and 54 percent over the age of 50. This reflects similar trends seen overseas where younger people, who are more socially active, often have higher infection rates, though it is the older age groups which are most likely to require hospital treatment from Covid-19.\", \"\\\"We are also seeing a continuing spread of cases across the country. The three Auckland DHBs continue to predominate with the highest rates of infection in the country - Auckland 1,843 cases per 100,000 population; Counties Manukau 2,596 per 100,000 population and Waitemata 1,179 per 100,000 population. Other areas with higher rates include Southern with 929 per 100,000; Waikato with 913 per 100,000 population and Bay of Plenty with 759 per 100,000 population.\\\"\", \"There were also 41 cases reported in MIQ today.\", \"There were 13,606 community cases reported yesterday and 12,011 cases on Friday, when five deaths were also reported.\", \"There have now been 85,667 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand since the pandemic began.\", \"The Ministry said 28,836 booster doses were given yesterday, as well as 353 first doses; 863 second doses; 80 third primary doses; 2891 paediatric first doses and 370 paediatric second doses.\", \"\\\"More than two thirds of eligible New Zealanders have now had their booster, a huge step in the fight against the spread of Omicron in our communities.\", \"\\\"Wild weather, traffic and queues didn't deter the 70 percent of those eligible - who have turned out at vaccination clinics across the motu over recent weeks. Credit also goes to our awesome team of more than 16,000 trained vaccinators who are doing the mahi.\", \"\\\"We thank each and every New Zealander who has joined the fight so far, being boosted has increased their protection against severe disease.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"ca2577e197eb11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ca2577e197eb11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
