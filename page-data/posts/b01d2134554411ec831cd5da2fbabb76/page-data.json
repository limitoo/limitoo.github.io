The summits are home to space observatories. Visitors traveling to the peak of Mauna Kea are advised to use only four-wheel-drive vehicles because of the steep terrain.\", \"\\u201cBear in mind, there is no one who lives up there,\\u201d said Maureen Ballard, a Weather Service meteorologist in Honolulu. \\u201cWe do get snow there pretty much every year.\\u201d\", \"On social media, some locals expressed exasperation with the breathless reactions of those on the mainland.\", \"\\u201cGuys. Guys. Calm down,\\u201d one woman wrote on Twitter. \\u201cI was born and raised on the Big Island of Hawaii. We get snow on the top of Mauna Kea almost every winter.\\u201d\", \"Still, a prediction of snow for Hawaii when much of the country had no such advisories surprised meteorologists around the country.\", \"To illustrate the contrast, the Weather Service posted a map of the United States showing states where it had been hundreds or even thousands of days since a blizzard warning had been issued. The last time there was a blizzard warning in Hawaii was 2018, Ms. Ballard said.\", \"The service warned people not to travel in the area unless there was an emergency.\", \"\\u201cTravel should be restricted to emergencies only,\\u201d the agency said. \\u201cIf you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle.\\u201d\", \"The Weather Service said that the blizzard was expected to deliver wind gusts of over 100 miles per hour and that the snow was expected to last until Sunday at 6 a.m. local time.\", \"The same storm system responsible for the blizzard had also brought rain to the region, a welcome sight in the Big Island, which has been hit by a severe drought.\", \"But there was also potential for flooding, and the Weather Service issued a flood watch for the whole island chain through Tuesday.\", \"\\u201cThe blizzard is grabbing the national attention, but it\\u2019s not as impactful as the rain,\\u201d said Tom Birchard, a senior forecaster with the service.\", \"Adam Weintraub, a spokesman for the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, said that little of the mountains\\u2019 surface was developed, so a winter blast comes with \\u201ca very limited set of effects, population-wise.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re watching with considerably more concern the rest of the storm system, because it\\u2019s got the possibility to produce flash floods and landslides,\\u201d he said.\", \"Ms. Ballard said the cold front also led to lower temperatures than usual in Honolulu.\", \"The overnight low early Saturday was 55 degrees, according to Mr. Birchard. The last time it had been that cold in December was in 1962, when the temperature fell to 54 degrees.\", \"\\u201cWe are having our version of a chill,\\u201d Ms. Ballard said. \\u201cI\\u2019m looking forward to sleeping today.
