Solomon Islands, and though things are unstable, there\\u00a0has been no\\u00a0\\\"loss of control\\\".\", \"Mr Morrison said it was not Australia's role to interfere\\u00a0\\\"in their democracy\\\", as calm returned to the Solomon Islands' capital Honiara on Saturday after days of rioting left at least three dead and reduced sections of the city to smouldering ruins.\", \"\\\"What we want to see happen in the Solomon Islands is for the people of the Solomon Islands under their constitution, under their normal processes to resolve any issues they have,\\\" Mr Morrison said on Sunday.\", \"\\\"We are just simply there as a good family member to try and provide a stable and safe environment for the issues that are there in the Solomon Islands to be peacefully worked.\\\"\", \"Petrol stations, shops and other businesses began to reopen on Saturday, with Honiara residents flocking to buy basic provisions as the violence ebbed.\", \"Mr Morrison said he was being updated regularly and had been discussing with\\u00a0New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern about getting some assistance.\", \"\\\"They (New Zealand) have a lot of expertise working within our Pacific family of nations,\\\" he said.\", \"Mr Morrison also thanked\\u00a0the governments of Papa New Guinea, Fiji and New Zealand for supporting the\\u00a0response.\", \"\\\"At this point, although things are very unstable at this point, there are no areas to our knowledge\\u00a0where there's been a loss of control,\\\" Mr Morrison said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Recovery to take a year and cost $39.3 million</div>\", \"What began as a small protest on Wednesday quickly descended into a violent free-for-all, with impoverished\\u00a0Honiara residents joining anti-government protesters to rampage through the shattered glass and burnt-out remains of businesses for things to eat or sell.\", \"For three straight days, angry mobs cut through the usually sleepy seaside capital, demanding the removal of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare.\", \"Two years of pandemic-induced closed borders have left the already ravaged Solomon Islands economy in tatters, deepening widespread joblessness and poverty among the population of around 800,000.\", \"An early estimate of the cost, released by the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands, said 56 buildings in the capital had been burnt and looted, with many businesses facing over a year-long recovery.\", \"While the loss to the economy was expected to be at least $39.3 million, with the bank's governor warning that the nation's accounts \\u2014 already struggling to recover from the COVID pandemic \\u2014 had been further weakened by the riots.\", \"A more thorough estimate of the damage would be released in the coming days, he added.\",

bus services resumed.\", \"A night-time curfew and the presence of roughly 150 foreign peacekeepers from Australia and Papua New Guinea appeared to have helped cool tensions.\", \"But the scale of the recovery was coming into sharp focus, even as the city remained on edge.\", \"Many Solomon Islanders believe their government is corrupt and beholden to Beijing and other foreign interests.\", \"\\\"Most people are barely getting one meal a day, there are no tourists and very little economic stimulus,\\\" Douglas Kelson, chief officer at St John Ambulance Service, told the AFP news wire.\",

attempting to torch parliament and the prime minister's private residence as police fired tear gas and warning shots.\", \"More than 100 people have been arrested for riot-related activity, Solomon Islands police said on Saturday as they tried to restore order.\", \"\\\"No one is above the law,\\\" said Commissioner Mostyn Mangau, urging residents to \\\"respect each other, as well as our visiting friends from abroad\\\".\", \"As tensions escalated, Mr Sogavare had begged neighbours for urgent help.\", \"In a letter obtained by the AFP news wire, the prime minister told his Papua New Guinea counterpart James Marape that \\\"certain elements\\\" had \\\"attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government\\\" and called for peacekeepers to be sent for a \\\"period of three to four weeks\\\".\", \"In an address to the nation, Mr Sogavare told citizens the Solomons had been \\\"brought to its knees\\\" by the rioting but vowed to resist calls for his resignation.\", \"But the political situation remained fraught.\", \"Opposition leaders on Saturday called for a vote of no confidence in Mr Sogavare's leadership.\", \"They may not yet have enough votes to pass the motion and remove Mr Sogavare from office, but the move could produce another flashpoint.\", \"The pro-Beijing leader claimed foreign powers opposed to his 2019 decision to switch the Solomons' diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China were behind the disturbances.\", \"But others pointed to inter-island tensions and widespread joblessness among the country's population \\u2013 40 per cent of whom are

central government, and divisions intensified when Mr Sogavare recognised Beijing.\", \"The Malaita Province, the most populous island of the archipelago, has maintained connections with Taipei in
