A U.A.W. spokesman said only that the union\\u2019s negotiating team was continuing \\u201cto discuss next steps.\\u201d\", \"Marc A. Howze, a senior Deere official, said in a statement Tuesday night that the agreement would have included an investment of \\u201can additional $3.5 billion in our employees, and by extension, our communities.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWith the rejection of the agreement covering our Midwest facilities, we will execute the next phase of our Customer Service Continuation Plan,\\u201d the statement continued, alluding to Deere\\u2019s use of salaried employees to run facilities where workers are striking.\", \"Many workers had complained that wage increases and retirement benefits included in the initial proposal were too weak given that the company \\u2014 known for its distinctive green-and-yellow John Deere products \\u2014 was on pace for a record of nearly $6 billion in annual profits.\", \"According to a summary produced by the union, wage increases under the more recent proposal would have been 10 percent this year and 5 percent in the third and fifth years. During each of the even years of the six-year contract, employees would have received lump-sum payments equivalent to 3 percent of their annual pay.\", \"That was up from earlier proposed wage increases of 5 or 6 percent this year, depending on a worker\\u2019s labor grade, and 3 percent in 2023 and 2025.\", \"The more recent proposal also included traditional pension benefits for future employees and a post-retirement health care fund seeded by $2,000 per year of service, neither of which were included in the initial agreement.\", \"Chris Laursen, a worker at a John Deere plant in Ottumwa, Iowa, who was president of his local there until recently, said he voted in favor of the new agreement after voting to reject the previous one.\", \"\\u201cWe have the support of the community, we have the support of workers all around the country,\\u201d Mr. Laursen said. \\u201cIf we turned down a 20 percent increase over a six-year period, substantial gains to our pension plan, I\\u2019m afraid we would lose that.\\u201d\", \"But Mr. Laursen said he still had concerns about the vagueness of the company\\u2019s commitment to improving its worker incentive plan, and such concerns appeared to weigh on his co-workers, 55 percent of whom voted to reject the newer contract.\", \"Another Iowa-based worker, Matt Pickrell, said that some co-workers skeptical of the second proposal had expressed a desire for a larger initial increase than the 10 percent the company offered.\", \"Mr. Pickrell said that he, too, had opposed the initial agreement but had voted in favor of the more recent one because of the improvements in retirement benefits.\", \"The work stoppage at Deere was part of an uptick in strikes around the country last month that also included more than 1,000 workers at Kellogg and more than 2,000 hospital workers in upstate New York.\", \"Overall, more than 25,000 workers walked off the job in October, versus an average of about 10,000 in each of the previous three months, according to data collected by researchers at Cornell University.\"]","href_hash":"cbeb41d43cee11ecab68000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cbeb41d43cee11ecab68000017025a03"}},
