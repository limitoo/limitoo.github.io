And last week, the company announced that the common name for the sandwich, \\u201cfluffernutter,\\u201d was among the 455 new terms added to its pages.\", \"New Englanders rejoiced. But why admit such a long-lived word to the lexicon now?\", \"Fluffernutter, defined by the dictionary as \\u201ca sandwich made with peanut butter and marshmallow cr\\u00e8me between two slices of white sandwich bread,\\u201d stood out among newer phrases like \\u201cvaccine passport\\u201d and \\u201cdad bod.\\u201d Even I, a New Englander who packed fluffernutters in her childhood lunchbox, had not thought much about the sandwich lately.\", \"Marshmallow Fluff, the brand of cr\\u00e8me typically used in a fluffernutter, has been around since at least 1917, when a man named Archibald Query first sold it door to door in Somerville, Mass. Soon after, two friends named H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower bought his formula for $500 and first marketed it as Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff.\", \"In the following decades, Fluff\\u2019s popularity spread. Its manufacturer, the Durkee Mower Company in Lynn, Mass., now pumps out about eight million pounds of the product each year, according to Jonathan Mower, the Durkee Mower president and the co-founder\\u2019s grandson. (A traditional plastic tub of Fluff contains one pound, but Fluff is also sold in a 7.5-ounce glass jar.)\", \"\\u201cI grew up eating these,\\u201d said Kathi Reinstein, a former Massachusetts legislator who had petitioned several times, unsuccessfully, to make fluffernutters the official state sandwich. \\u201cThere are some things you can create and they make you think of all the warm and fuzzy stuff that mattered to you. And one of those is the fluffernutter.\\u201d\", \"The treat is so beloved that Somerville is home to an annual What the Fluff? festival, where tens of thousands of people celebrate every possible use of the concoction, a mixture of corn syrup, sugar, egg white and vanillin.\", \"Peter Sokolowski, editor at large at Merriam-Webster in Springfield, Mass., said the local enthusiasm for Fluff did not influence the dictionary\\u2019s decision-making. \\u201cWe are not the dictionary of New England English,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cThere is no advocacy,\\u201d he added, and a word\\u2019s currency is not necessarily a function of novelty. \\u201cWe watch to see, is this word\\u2019s use growing or is it falling? If the word is growing \\u2014 even incrementally, even slowly, like fluffernutter \\u2014 then it belongs in the dictionary.\\u201d\", \"He added, \\u201cEvery word has its own pace.\\u201d\", \"The \\u201cevidence of first use\\u201d for fluffernutter occurred in The Daily Freeman newspaper in Kingston, N.Y., on Nov. 20, 1961, Mr. Sokolowski said. But over the years, the word remained mostly spoken and rarely printed, so it lacked the criteria for inclusion in the dictionary.\", \"In 2006, a political kerfuffle began to change that. A state senator in Massachusetts, upset that his son wanted Fluff after eating a fluffernutter at school, sought to limit how many times a school could serve the sandwiches each week, as part of a bill to improve nutrition. (The New York Times reported at the time that fluffernutters met nutritional guidelines in the son\\u2019s school district; Fluff has fewer sugars per serving \\u2014 six grams per two tablespoons \\u2014 than many jellies.)\", \"In response, Ms. Reinstein filed legislation to make the fluffernutter the state sandwich. She recalled constituents\\u2019 yelling, \\u201cFight for Fluff! Fight for Fluff!\\u201d\", \"Both the senator\\u2019s and Ms. Reinstein\\u2019s efforts languished, but Mr. Sokolowski said the resulting national media coverage helped put the word on a trajectory to eventually join the dictionary. Merriam-Webster chose \\u201cfluffernutter\\u201d \\u2014 one word, lowercase \\u2014 because publications mostly styled the term this way, though the entry offers an uppercase variant, Mr. Sokolowski said.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s very cool, there\\u2019s no question about it,\\u201d said Mr. Mower, whose company makes Marshmallow Fluff. \\u201cWe were out walking the dog, and I saw a number of neighbors and friends on the walk. And they\\u2019re all saying, \\u2018Hey, we saw the news about the dictionary!\\u2019\\u201d\", \"New Englanders also seem to agree on another key fluffernutter element.\", \"Mimi Graney founded the Fluff festival and documented the history of the ingredient in her book \\u201cFluff: The Sticky Sweet Story of an American Icon.\\u201d\", \"Like others interviewed, she said: \\u201cIf you\\u2019re going to put Fluff on a sandwich, it\\u2019s got to have the Teddie peanut butter, which is another New England brand.\\u201d\", \"But just as the word is recorded for posterity, the actual sandwich may be waning in popularity. Outside New England, it is fairly rare, with Fluff not as widely available west of the Mississippi River (though Kraft sells a similar product called Jet-Puffed Marshmallow Creme). And as schools nationwide move toward nut-free policies to protect children with allergies, students may be more likely to run across \\u201cfluffernutter\\u201d in the dictionary than a fluffernutter in the lunchroom.\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
