The Bureau of Labor Statistics carries out two separate surveys, one of employers and another of households; we normally expect the two to paint a similar picture. This time, not so much.\", \"The employer survey was, to use the technical term, meh \\u2014 210,000 jobs added, a respectable number but not what many had hoped for. The household survey, however, was terrific; in particular, the employment rate among prime-age adults, a key measure of labor market health, is beginning to approach prepandemic levels.\", \"Well, we shouldn\\u2019t make too much of the apparent inconsistencies in the report. Noisy data happens, and overall the economic picture looks pretty good \\u2014 indeed, in many ways this looks like the best economic recovery in many decades.\", \"Yet consumers appear to be feeling very downbeat \\u2014 or at least that\\u2019s what they tell surveys like the famous Michigan Survey of Consumers. And this perception of a bad economy is clearly weighing on President Biden\\u2019s approval rating. Which raises the question: Are consumers right? Is this a bad economy despite data showing it as very good? And if it really isn\\u2019t a bad economy, why does the public say it is?\", \"Just to be clear, I genuinely want to know the answer to these questions. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a crude case of \\u201cpeople are being lied to by the corporate media,\\u201d although if you ask me, it\\u2019s silly when people in the media get all huffy over any suggestion that how they report on the economy has an influence on public perceptions. (If it doesn\\u2019t, why do they bother?)\", \"So what is going on? Let\\u2019s start with the obvious culprit, inflation, which is indeed running hotter than it has for decades.\", \"Rising prices have certainly eroded many workers\\u2019 wage gains, although real personal income per capita is still above its prepandemic level even though the government is no longer handing out lots of money. And my sense is that inflation has a corrosive effect on confidence even when incomes are keeping up, because it creates the perception that things are out of control.\", \"That said, surveys about inflation also illustrate the point that when you talk to consumers, the questions they answer may not be the ones you thought you were asking. It\\u2019s a longstanding observation \\u2014 almost a running joke \\u2014 that the \\u201cexpected inflation\\u201d number from the Michigan Surveys is, in practice, basically the price of gasoline.\", \"So what question are people really answering when asked about the state of the economy? One clue is that there\\u2019s an incredible amount of partisan skew in the responses. Republicans say, bizarrely, that current economic conditions are much worse than they were in March 2009, when the economy was losing 800,000 jobs a month.\", \"Another clue is that you get very different answers when you ask people \\u201cHow are you doing?\\u201d rather than \\u201cHow is the economy doing?\\u201d The Langer Consumer Confidence Index asks people separately about the national economy \\u2014 where their assessment is dismal \\u2014 and about their personal financial situation, where their rating is high by historical standards. The Michigan Surveys don\\u2019t ask quite the same questions, but they do ask people how their current financial situation compares with five years earlier; 63 percent say they\\u2019re better off, the same number as in September 1984, just before Ronald Reagan won an electoral landslide with claims that it was \\u201cmorning in America.\\u201d\", \"Aside from looking at what people say, surely it makes sense to look at what they do. If consumers are really as depressed as the sentiment numbers say, why are retail sales running so high?\", \"And if we turn our attention from consumers to businesses, what we see is a huge surge in capital expenditures. That is, businesses are investing as if they see a booming economy and expect the boom to continue.\", \"In short, the public\\u2019s highly negative assessment of the economy is at odds with every other indicator I can think of. Again, what\\u2019s going on?\", \"As I said, part of the answer is probably that inflation unnerves people even when their incomes are keeping up. This may be especially true when there are big increases in the cost of filling one\\u2019s gas tank, a cost that has psychological salience far larger than its 4 percent weight in the Consumer Price Index.\", \"Partisanship is also definitely a factor. Two-thirds of Republicans believe that the 2020 election was stolen; how much of a stretch is it for them also to believe that the Biden economy is terrible, whatever their personal experience?\", \"Finally, as I also said, it\\u2019s implausible to assert that the tone of media coverage is irrelevant. It\\u2019s not even necessarily a partisan thing. My world is full of economic commentators who have spent years eager to moralize about the evils of inflation and who were bitterly disappointed when their hoped-for disaster failed to materialize a decade ago. Now they have their chance, and they\\u2019re surely having some effect on public perceptions.\", \"So it\\u2019s important to keep perspective. This is actually a very good economy, albeit with some problems. Don\\u2019t let the doomsayers tell you otherwise.\"]","href_hash":"2d523b9c595711ecb1fc8d1e139fca41"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2d523b9c595711ecb1fc8d1e139fca41"}},
