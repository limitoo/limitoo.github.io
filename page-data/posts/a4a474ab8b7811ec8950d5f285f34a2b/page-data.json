Fitzsimmons","country":"us","create_time":"2022-02-11T12:26:33.000Z","content":"[\"New York City on Friday is expected to fire as many as 3,000 municipal workers who have refused to get coronavirus vaccines.\", \"They make up a small fraction of the city\\u2019s employees \\u2014 less than 1 percent. But they would probably represent the most drastic example of a work force reduction tied to a coronavirus vaccine mandate. Mayor Eric Adams has said that he would prefer not to fire the unvaccinated, but by remaining so, they were \\u201cquitting.\\u201d\", \"They are not going quietly. Hundreds marched across the Brooklyn Bridge on Monday, chanting that the city should end the mandate and carrying signs that said \\u201cUnvaccinated Lives Matter\\u201d and \\u201cFire Fauci.\\u201d Mr. Adams has reaffirmed the city\\u2019s ultimatum: They will be the ones fired unless they get at least one shot.\", \"The mandate, put in place by Mr. Adams\\u2019s predecessor, Bill de Blasio, has been effective: About 95 percent of the city\\u2019s 370,000 workers have received at least one dose of the vaccine, an increase from 84 percent when the mandate was first announced in October.\", \"Mr. Adams has repeatedly said that he preferred not to fire police officers, firefighters and teachers, but that it was more important to enforce vaccination against the virus.\", \"\\u201cWe have to be very clear \\u2014 people must be vaccinated if they are New York City employees,\\u201d Mr. Adams said at a news conference on Thursday. \\u201cEveryone understood that.\\u201d\", \"Other cities like Boston and Chicago have moved to require vaccination for city employees and have faced serious pushback from unions and workers. In other places like San Francisco, Washington State and Massachusetts, hundreds of workers have lost their jobs, though most have complied with mandates.\", \"New York has also seen resistance to its mandate. Unions filed a lawsuit, arguing that the city had overstepped its authority, but the challenges were not successful. A group of unions filed a new lawsuit on Tuesday, claiming that the city was not following due process by firing workers.\", \"City officials said the potential dismissals should have no effect on city services: The 3,000 targeted workers have been on unpaid leave for months. The city also suggested that the actual number of people fired may be lower, as some may decide to get vaccinated just before the Friday deadline or submit proof of vaccination.\", \"Mr. Adams, a Democrat who took office in January, chose to keep other pandemic policies enacted by Mr. de Blasio, including vaccine requirements for private employers and for indoor dining, gyms and movie theaters. About 38,400 city workers have received at least one dose of the vaccine since the municipal mandate was announced in October.\"]","href_hash":"a4a474ab8b7811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a4a474ab8b7811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
