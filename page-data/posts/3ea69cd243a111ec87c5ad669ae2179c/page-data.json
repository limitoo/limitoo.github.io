But on Monday she plans to formally announce her candidacy for New York State attorney general, a turn she could not have foreseen a year ago when the former governor, with his Must See TV Covid briefings, was still holding on to a 65 percent approval rating, and the state\\u2019s top prosecutor, Letitia James, now making a bid for his old job, seemed happy to be exactly where she was.\", \"\\u201cThe A.G.\\u2019s office is the best legal job in the country for people\\u2019s lawyering, and there\\u2019s no other job I would run for,\\u201d she told me recently. \\u201cI just didn\\u2019t expect it to open up for a long time.\\u201d Ms. Teachout made a play once before, when the job was last available in 2018, but it went to Ms. James, who had Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s support and who, in Shakespearean fashion, would later become central to his fall.\", \"At the moment, Ms. Teachout, seems to be one of the most obvious beneficiaries of that erasure, given that any political aspirations she had were unlikely to thrive while Mr. Cuomo remained in power, drinking thirstily from the spigot of retribution.\", \"Seven years ago, she emerged from relative obscurity as a legal academic with an expertise in corruption to help successfully shift state politics leftward when she challenged Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s re-election, receiving an astonishing third of the primary vote. Threatened by her showing and what it said about the magnitude of progressive sentiment, the governor eventually began supporting measures like a $15 an hour minimum wage and paid family leave. After years of pressure, he broke up a faction of independent Democrats in the State Senate who caucused with Republicans and stymied liberal lawmakers.\", \"Ms. Teachout is re-entering politics now in a much different position, with a national profile. At the same time the pendulum isn\\u2019t necessarily in the same place that it was in 2014 or even 2018. The latest election cycle, in which Democrats in New York found themselves stunned by losses to Republicans both upstate and down, suggests a challenging moment for progressives. Beyond that, Ms. Teachout has lost all three of the elections in which she participated.\", \"As the country has fallen deeper into the throes of polarization, both Democrats and Republicans have directed more hope and faith at state prosecutors to address grievances the federal government now seems impotent to resolve, creating increasingly ambitious agendas. On a recent morning, after her son was dropped off at day care and before her property law class was set to begin at Fordham, where she has taught for 12 years, Ms. Teachout conveyed her plans. She explained, for example, how she would expand the attorney general\\u2019s focus on worker safety, wage theft and issues of climate and environmental justice, making fossil-fuel companies liable for the damage they cause.\", \"\\u201cI think it can be helpful to think of the A.G. as the largest public interest law firm in the country,\\u201d she wrote me later. \\u201cWe all know that big pharma, polluters and fossil fuel companies cause enormous harm, and big landlords don\\u2019t provide healthy housing \\u2014 people spend 90 percent of their time indoors; mold is a climate issue \\u2014 but I don\\u2019t think people realize the awesome power of the office to make it too costly for these big companies to keep harming us.\\u201d\", \"Around the country, state prosecutors have been experimenting with ways in which oil and gas companies might be held accountable for climate change. The litigation relies, in part, on a successful model deployed by states in the 1990s which argued that the chronic and deadly illnesses caused by cigarettes significantly drove up public health costs. These types of suits are still uncharted territory when it comes to the fossil-fuel industry. New York State lost a related case two years ago when a judge determined that Ms. James\\u2019s office had failed to prove that Exxon had committed shareholder fraud in its statements around its accounting for the cost of climate-change regulation.\", \"Still, Ms. Teachout maintains it was the right case for the attorney general\\u2019s office to bring. \\u201cThe evidence was strong \\u2014 the industry had the science cases 30 years ago, and, like opioids, its clear that part of the business model of fossil fuel companies is lying for profit,\\u201d she said.\", \"Not long after he took office, Minnesota\\u2019s attorney general, Keith Ellison, who later prosecuted Officer Derek Chauvin, brought suit against Exxon Mobil, Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute over what he identified as \\u201ca campaign of deception\\u201d around the effects on climate. Although coming from academia is hardly considered an advantage in American politics, Mr. Ellison, who has known Ms. Teachout for years, pointed out that it is a particular kind of intellectual depth that is needed to pursue these new and increasingly complex frontiers in civil litigation. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not always clear how to redress a tremendous wrong,\\u201d he said. From lead paint to guns, to oil and gas, there are cases that prosecutors don\\u2019t always have the most useful legal frameworks for, he said.\", \"Ms. Teachout, the daughter of a law professor and a judge, is likely to face off against several Democratic challengers that could include Brooklyn\\u2019s district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, as well as Daniel S. Goldman, a former federal prosecutor hired by House democrats to join the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. The New York state senator Shelley Mayer announced that she was running earlier this month.\", \"Never having held elected office, never having earned millions of dollars at a white-shoe firm, Ms. Teachout might proceed with a candidacy that serves as a test of just how much independence voters are \\u2014 or aren\\u2019t \\u2014 actually seeking. Driven by indignation more than ideology, in a kind of race where divisive culture-war issues are not especially relevant, she might speak to populists of all kinds \\u2014 the world of people united in their hatred for Mark Zuckerberg.\", \"\\u201cI first really started paying attention to Zephyr when she took on Cuomo in that primary,\\u2019\\u2019 the environmentalist Bill McKibben told me. \\u201cEverybody had been working really hard on fracking in New York State. There was a wonderful citizens\\u2019 movement upstate, but because it was upstate no one really paid attention to it. Even I had not realized how big and deep it had gotten until Zephyr ran for governor. And she was really hitting it hard.\\u201d\", \"Though she fell short in her long-shot run for the nomination for governor, she swept certain upstate counties. \\u201cI was looking at the election returns that night and I said, \\u2018OK we\\u2019re going to have a ban on fracking in a few weeks.\\u2019\\u201d Gov. Cuomo, not long after, enacted one.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve spent a lot of time with politicians, and there aren\\u2019t that many who are really that willing to take on, in serious ways, entrenched concentrations of power,\\u201d Mr. McKibben said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very hard to see a path where Congress and the judiciary stand up to Exxon or Facebook or forces like them,\\u2019\\u2019 he said, which makes the jobs of attorney general in New York and California some of the most influential in the country. \\u201cThere are things that desperately need to change and she strikes me as a very useful crowbar.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3ea69cd243a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3ea69cd243a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}},
