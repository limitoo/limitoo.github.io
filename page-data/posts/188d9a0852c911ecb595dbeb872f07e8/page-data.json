Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey decisions.\", \"Roberts, who is expected to be a pivotal vote in the case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, repeatedly turned to the topic of fetal viability on Wednesday, suggesting that the Court could discard the idea entirely or set the viability line much earlier while still upholding other abortion rights.\", \"In his questioning, the chief justice suggested that the viability line established in Roe and Casey was dicta, meaning it was not officially part of the Supreme Court's ruling.\", \"\\\"Viability, it seems to me, doesn't have anything to do with choice.
