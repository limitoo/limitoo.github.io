Hannity then asks the former presidential hopeful, does Youngkin \\\"need to win for this to have the maximum impact? What if it's really tight?\\\"\", \"Gingrich replied: \\\"First of all, if it's really tight, they'll steal it. So you can't afford to have a really tight election. You have to win by a big enough margin, they can't steal it.\", \"\\\"Second, if Youngkin wins, which I think he will if everybody turns out to vote tomorrow, this is an earthquake. If Youngkin almost wins, it's an interesting tremor, but it's not going to shake things up.\\\"\", \"Gingrich echoed similar statements put out by former president Donald Trump in the run up to the Virginia election in which he urged people to get out the vote in order to make it harder for Democrats to supposedly rig the results.\", \"Trump has continuously pushed the \\\"big lie\\\" that he lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden due to widespread voter fraud, despite having no evidence to back this claim.\", \"\\\"Everything is on the line in this election, and every MAGA voter should strongly support Glenn Youngkin. We must win bigger than the margin of fraud by flooding the polls with those that believe in America First,\\\" Trump said in a statement on Monday.\", \"Youngkin, who has appeared to distance himself from Trump's endorsement during the election campaign, also suggested that the Democrats will attempt to overturn the results if McAuliffe loses.\", \"Speaking to Fox News' Mark Levin on Sunday, Youngkin called McAuliffe a \\\"failing politician\\\" over his decision to hire Marc Elias, a high-profile attorney who has worked on a number of notable election challenges for the Democrats.\", \"Levin asked Youngkin if he is concerned that by hiring Elias the Democrats are \\\"going to try to do everything they can to undo\\\" the closely contested election in Virginia.\", \"\\\"This is right out of his playbook. I mean, he wrote it, and this is what a failing politician does when they see the sun setting on their 43-year political career,\\\" Youngkin replied.\", \"Gingrich has been contacted for further comment.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1924105/newt-gingrich-virginia.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Former U.S. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-GA) speaks during a discussion at the Heritage Foundation December 13, 2016 in Washington, D.C.</div>\"]","href_hash":"27a53aca3bbe11eca9f5000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"27a53aca3bbe11eca9f5000017025a03"}},
