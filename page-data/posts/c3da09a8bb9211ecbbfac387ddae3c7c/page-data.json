There is a binding agreement in place between the parties and it should be honoured,\\\" Little said.\", \"\\\"I therefore urge all parties to this settlement to act in good faith, to honour the commitments they have made and to resolve this situation as quickly as possible.\\\"\", \"Neither the PSA nor the NZNO were commenting yet.\", \"An NZNO spokesperson said Andrew Little had spoken out on the move before they had a chance to communicate with their members.\", \"The spokesperson said the union leadership wanted to talk with members before speaking publicly.\", \"Little said the U-turn was a concerning development.\", \"\\\"My expectation is that the parties to this pay equity agreement stand by what they've agreed to. If there are misunderstandings, it's my expectation that they will work quickly to resolve any misunderstandings.\\\"\", \"It was \\\"very unusual\\\" for a union to relitigate terms of settlement they have already agreed too, Little said.\", \"I think the parties should meet and if there are misunderstandings about what each has agreed to, then they should resolve that. I have to say, as a former union leader involved in negotiating settlements, it is very unusual for a union to relitigate terms of settlement that they have already signed up to. I just find that very unusual.\\\"\", \"There was a willingness for the parties to talk, Little said.\", \"\\\"I urge them to do so. But I urge them to do so in the spirit in which they've engaged so far. And on the basis of sticking to the agreements that they've made. And so that we can get to a point where we could increase nurses pay and address that long standing injustice.\\\"\", \"When asked if the dispute was solvable, Little said \\\"everything's solvable, just with a bit of time.\\\"\", \"Little said the pay equity settlement would add more than $520 million to the health payroll, and Cabinet had released the money.\", \"District health boards said they were are surprised by the move and were keen to talk to the NZNO as soon as possible.\"]","href_hash":"c3da09a8bb9211ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c3da09a8bb9211ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
