But the government\\u2019s commitments to Europe, NATO and the trans-Atlantic relationship are solid, part of postwar Germany\\u2019s DNA. And based on tradition and the importance for Europe of the Berlin-Paris relationship, Chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit France almost immediately after being sworn in.\", \"In a modest but important shift in tone, the coalition is promising a more robust and practical military positioning, backing the notion that the European Union must become better able to defend its interests as the United States focuses more on China and the Indo-Pacific. Mr. Scholz speaks regularly of \\u201cEuropean sovereignty,\\u201d a softer version of the \\u201cstrategic autonomy\\u201d favored by President Emmanuel Macron of France.\", \"Veering from a traditional demand for a \\u201cEuropean army,\\u201d the governing agreement instead calls for \\u201cincreased cooperation between national armies of E.U. members willing to integrate, especially in training, capabilities, operations and equipment\\u201d \\u2014 a position that will please Mr. Macron, whose country takes over the rotating European presidency on Jan. 1 and is himself running for re-election in April.\", \"The agreement also promises to improve the woeful state of Germany\\u2019s armed forces, though it is silent on the country\\u2019s 2014 pledge to increase military spending to the 2 percent of economic output promised to NATO by 2024. Instead, there is a fuzzy promise to spend, \\u201cin the long run,\\u201d 3 percent on diplomacy, international development and defense.\", \"Jana Puglierin of the European Council on Foreign Relations assessed the plan\\u2019s defense and foreign policy planks as \\u201ccarefully balanced\\u201d and \\u201cstronger than I expected.\\u201d She pointed in particular to a commitment to continue \\u201cnuclear sharing\\u201d with NATO, whereby German airplanes would drop U.S.-owned nuclear bombs in the case of all-out war and replace aging aircraft.\", \"On China, said Janka Oertel, the same research institute\\u2019s Asia director, talk of the country as \\u201ca strategic partner is definitely gone,\\u201d with much more emphasis on Beijing as \\u201ca systemic rival\\u201d and economic competitor. There are explicit mentions of Taiwan, abuses in Hong Kong and rights violations in Xinjiang, which will not please Beijing, she said.\", \"There is a promise, however vague, to at least coordinate Germany\\u2019s policy on China with European policy. And the coalition is pulling back from Angela Merkel\\u2019s support for an E.U.-China investment treaty. But given the power of German industry and its reliance on an export model, it remains to be seen how confrontational the new government will be with China.\", \"The language on Russia, too, is \\u201cvery sober,\\u201d Ms. Puglierin said, and takes account of the concerns of Central European and Baltic nations. \\u201cGermany is no longer looking for good relations with Russia,\\u201d she said, \\u201cbut for stable relations and constructive dialogue.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"92916434580c11ecbceed761c9a788a1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"92916434580c11ecbceed761c9a788a1"}},
