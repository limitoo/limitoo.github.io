The planes have long been a source of public fascination and lore, as Mr. Epstein was known to travel with prominent politicians and Hollywood celebrities as well as young women \\u2014 and girls, some accusers have said \\u2014 to entertain guests on board.\", \"The names of some high-profile passengers came out under cross-examination on Tuesday, as a lawyer for Ms. Maxwell, Christian Everdell, asked Mr. Visoski if he remembered flying \\u201cpretty important people,\\u201d naming Bill Clinton, Donald J. Trump, Prince Andrew, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the actor Kevin Spacey. Mr. Visoski said that he remembered traveling with all but Mr. Kennedy and that he did not recall whether he ever flew the family of Mr. Trump, who traveled on the plane before his presidency.\", \"When Mr. Visoski first came to work for Mr. Epstein, in 1991, the financier had a Gulfstream plane, he testified, outfitted with leather chairs and a burgundy carpet. The cockpit was separated by a door that was always closed, Mr. Visoski said.\", \"In around 2001, Mr. Epstein bought a Boeing 727, a larger aircraft whose interior, Mr. Visoski said, had multiple compartments, including a full kitchen and what he called \\u201cthe Round Room,\\u201d which had a doughnut-shaped couch.\", \"There, too, the cockpit door was always closed, Mr. Visoski said.\", \"Mr. Epstein sometimes introduced him to guests as they boarded the plane. That included a young woman, a singer identified in court as Jane, whom Mr. Epstein brought into the cockpit. Mr. Visoski described her as \\u201ca mature woman, with piercing, powder blue eyes.\\u201d\", \"Prosecutors have introduced Jane as one of Mr. Maxwell\\u2019s underage accusers. She is likely to testify at the trial, and jurors were shown a copy of her birth certificate.\", \"Under cross-examination by Mr. Everdell, Mr. Visoski confirmed that he could watch the passengers boarding the planes. He said that sometimes, they included young girls traveling with their families, but that he did not see any unaccompanied young women who looked younger than 20.\", \"Mr. Visoski told Mr. Everdell that he \\u201cnever saw any sexual activity\\u201d on the flights. Asked if he ever saw sex acts with underage girls, Mr. Visoski said, \\u201cI certainly did not.\\u201d\", \"He also said that Mr. Epstein did not mandate that the cockpit door be closed, and that he had invited them to walk to the back of the aircraft if, for example, they had to use the restroom.\", \"\\u201cLike right now,\\u201d Mr. Visoski said, drawing laughs from the courtroom.\", \"During his cross-examination, Mr. Visoski was asked what kind of advance notice he might have about Mr. Epstein\\u2019s passengers, particularly if they had privacy and security concerns. Mr. Everdell asked specifically about Mr. Clinton. \\u201cIf he were going to be on the flight, you might be told that information in advance,\\u201d Mr. Everdell said. \\u201cYou\\u2019d want to make sure the plane looked nice.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYes,\\u201d Mr. Visoski said.\"]","href_hash":"d041b0d4522311ecbe28f94e1c278091"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d041b0d4522311ecbe28f94e1c278091"}},
