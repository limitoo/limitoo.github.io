A sexologist and counselor who specializes in autism spectrum disorder, she was reluctant to appear in the series, where her private work helping people navigate the challenges of dating would be made into entertainment.\", \"\\u201cOriginally I said that there\\u2019s no way that I\\u2019m going to be filmed doing my work on television because it\\u2019s very vulnerable,\\u201d Ms. Rodgers said over Zoom from her home in Alstonville, on the east coast of Australia. \\u201cI hold my job to a really high standard, and I really believe in developing a genuine relationship with the people that I work with.\\u201d\", \"Her concerns were assuaged when she realized she\\u2019d have hours to work with each client, though the time seems much shorter once the taped material is edited. \\u201cPeople say, \\u2018Gee, you did so well in three minutes,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Rodgers said. \\u201cOr I\\u2019ve got somebody saying, \\u2018How dare you say that to so and so?\\u2019 I\\u2019m like, \\u2018That was 30 seconds of our conversation.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The show, which was first broadcast on ABC Australia, has been criticized for a lack of diversity and approaching its subjects with a \\u201cneurotypical gaze.\\u201d But it has also found many fans around the world who enjoy its \\u201cwarmth and insight\\u201d and \\u201cauthenticity.\\u201d Much of that is to Ms. Rodgers\\u2019s credit.\", \"\\u201cWe all know the anxiety of first dates,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe all know how complex it is, how nerve-racking. We all know that we spend hours prior to going out grooming ourselves. Being autistic is not different from the rest of us in that way. But there\\u2019s just some innate difficulties that autistic people have in this area.\\u201d (She has a forthcoming book on the subject, which will be published by Little Brown Spark.)\", \"In the interview below, which has been edited, Ms. Rodgers spoke about those particular challenges, her techniques for confronting them and what parents can do to support children who are ready to find the one.\", \"Can you describe your approach to counseling people who are on the autism spectrum and want to begin dating?\", \"Before somebody comes to see me, I might find out that they\\u2019re really, really into motorbikes. I don\\u2019t know anything about motorbikes at all, but what I would do is that in my office, I\\u2019ll put a motorbike magazine down, or I\\u2019ll put something in the environment that would give us a connection.\", \"With a lot of typical counseling, we would mimic each other. I\\u2019d be watching your body language at all times. With an autistic person, you\\u2019ve got to throw all that out the window. It\\u2019s like being in a foreign culture sometimes. You\\u2019ve got to throw away all of your understanding of body language and social skills and really just see that person as their own unique self. It\\u2019s so individual the way their autism presents, let alone, you know, their past and culture and gender.\", \"Some people would say something like, \\u201cWhy are you teaching autistic people neurotypical social skills?\\u201d And I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cI\\u2019m not. I\\u2019m teaching them what neurotypical people expect of them. I\\u2019m not expecting them to act that way.\\u201d\", \"What are some areas you focus on with clients?\", \"The presentation of autism is so diverse, it will be very different for every single person. One of the common themes for people that I find is just getting yourself out there.\", \"But then a lot of it is just reading the room. When you\\u2019re on a date with another person, you are constantly scanning that person, constantly picking up on the nuance of their body language, facial expressions. Many people that I work with and help on the show really like clear, blunt, straightforward communication.\", \"Part of the neurotypical experience is that when we\\u2019re flirting with each other or when we\\u2019re trying to give each other a little signal, we don\\u2019t just come straight out and go, \\u201cMan, I think you are the sexiest person alive.\\u201d We, as neurotypical people, do this dance around each other all the time.\", \"The other thing I work with people on is having self-advocacy or self-esteem within those first moments. Being able to express, \\u201chere are my communication needs\\u201d or \\u201chere are things I have difficulty with.\\u201d When we go out on a first date, sometimes we don\\u2019t want to talk about our flaws or our needs straight away.\", \"How did you get into this work?\", \"What I realized was that when people were leaving school, we weren\\u2019t talking about adult relationships. I wanted to kind of get into that. I started working within the community sector, in adult disability services and sexual health counseling and education.\", \"And then I went and got more degrees, a counseling degree and then a master\\u2019s in sexual health counseling.\", \"My understanding of sexuality isn\\u2019t about the act of sex. My understanding of sexuality is about body image, self-esteem, our capacity to give consent, our capacity to negotiate with an intimate partner, our capacity to compromise with another person.\", \"I think that it leaves a lot of people quite vulnerable and open to abuse. We have really neglected to provide a really good, comprehensive sexuality education and comprehensive relationship education.\", \"How has your life changed since the show premiered?\", \"Before this, I was a therapist working in the office. I didn\\u2019t have social media. I was just seeing the same people every day. And now people are interested in what I\\u2019ve got to say. I\\u2019m getting requests from all over the globe.\", \"I noticed you often use visual aids in your coaching sessions. Why is that?\", \"When I\\u2019m drawing, I\\u2019m trying to support the learning of people whose preferred way of learning is visual and not auditory.\", \"The other thing with drawing is that, if you and I were doing counseling together, I would sit opposite you like this and we wouldn\\u2019t have anything between us. That can be really confronting to an autistic person. If I\\u2019ve got my head down and I\\u2019m drawing, I don\\u2019t put the pressure on somebody else to interact with me socially.\", \"There are so many people whose auditory processing is supported if they\\u2019re doing something else. Clicking their fingernails, plaiting their hair. Neurotypical people might say to you, \\u201cStop doodling and listen to me.\\u201d But what they\\u2019re not understanding is when you\\u2019re doodling, that\\u2019s helping you to listen.\", \"What are some ways that parents who have neurodiverse children can support them as they enter the dating world?\", \"Sometimes somebody will get to the age where they want to start dating, but they actually can\\u2019t even name one friend. Dating is another layer to friendship. It\\u2019s kind of pulling people back a little bit. Let\\u2019s look at the things we need to do before we can run out and go on a date.\", \"And the other one I always talk to people about is self-confidence. To put yourself out there, to go on dates, and to enter a group to meet people, you have to have a level of confidence to do that.\", \"I ask many autistic people when I first get to know them, \\u201cTell me three things that are great about you,\\u201d and often they\\u2019ll say something like, \\u201cI\\u2019m really good at computer games.\\u201d No, no, not what are you good at? Name three things that are good about you. It\\u2019s really about helping people have a good sense of self-identity.\", \"That\\u2019s a great lesson for everyone.\", \"People are attracted to people that say, \\u201cI\\u2019m a good person and I\\u2019ve got lots to offer.\\u201d You don\\u2019t actually say it. But we show another person that we\\u2019re likable because we like ourselves.\", \"For so long, there\\u2019s been a cultural understanding that a disabled person is lesser than an able-bodied person. We\\u2019ve got to change the narrative. Autistic people have really got a great sense of pride that\\u2019s coming through now. They\\u2019re talking about autism as a strength and not a disability. But you can\\u2019t have a cultural shift of language and you can\\u2019t have a cultural shift of perspective unless we\\u2019re all doing it.\"]","href_hash":"9a774eed492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9a774eed492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}},
