But in the small towns, it is often hard to find a Plan B.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-01-23T00:03:45.000Z","content":"[\"In Marvell, Ark., a tiny Mississippi Delta town of 855 residents tucked into a sea of cotton, soy bean and corn fields, Lee Guest is a particularly essential essential worker.\", \"He is the mayor and the assistant fire chief, and his day job is as a rural mail carrier. If the four employees of the local water utility don\\u2019t show up, he knows enough about the system to keep the water flowing, too.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s a handful of us \\u2014 we can go get stuff taken care of,\\u201d he said.\", \"So when he was away from work for a week after contracting Covid-19 at the beginning of the year, the worn engine of small town governance and administration in Marvell, about a 90-minute drive southwest from Memphis, sputtered and coughed, but it chugged on.\", \"Out of 13 full-time and 11 part-time employees, six have gotten Covid-19. One, who went to a hospital but wasn\\u2019t admitted, got sick in 2020. The rest of the cases have tested positive in the last three weeks.\", \"It\\u2019s a familiar story in small towns across the country, where the spike in infections from the Omicron variant hit local governments with particular force. The virus has ripped through big cities like Los Angeles and New York, sidelining thousands of police officers and transit operators. In many, leaders have rushed to reassure residents that firefighters and paramedics will show up when they call amid record absences.\", \"But in small communities, the people responsible for keeping crucial public services up and running say the strain is acute: With bare-bones workforces already stretched thin, there is no margin for error when multiple workers have to call in sick.\", \"\\u201cSmall as we are, if we get one phone call, that can cause a ripple,\\u201d said Sean Pederson, the city manager of Bonner Springs, Kan., a community of about 7,800 residents some 20 miles west of Kansas City.\", \"Mr. Pederson said he has found himself mopping floors during the pandemic when city hall janitors were out with the virus. Over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, a snowstorm blanketed the region. With multiple employees out on the city\\u2019s public works staff, other departments scrambled to find workers to plow the streets.\", \"Verden, Okla., population 508, narrowly avoided having to cancel a town council meeting for lack of a quorum earlier this month. Three of five council members had been sick or in quarantine, and Oklahoma ended the state of emergency that allowed for remote meetings, said Tessa Upton, the town clerk.\", \"Ms. Upton, who is one of two people who works in the main office at town hall, said she has asked residents to drop their water bill payments through a slot in the door largely to protect the town\\u2019s utility billing clerk. If residents must come in, she said, they\\u2019ve been asked to wear masks \\u2014 a request often ignored by the residents of the town in Grady County, where just 36 percent of the population is fully vaccinated.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re trying to stay safe in here,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIf we go down, we\\u2019re not going to have water.\\u201d\", \"The stresses are the effects of short-term pandemic crises piled on top of demographic trends that have played out over decades as work has disappeared in industries like agriculture and manufacturing, and young people leave for better opportunities elsewhere.\", \".\", \"\\u201cLonger term, we\\u2019ve seen really strong economic challenges in rural America as the urban-rural divide has expanded,\\u201d said Brooks Rainwater, director of the National League of Cities\\u2019 Center for City Solutions. The pandemic, he said, has compounded those issues by exacerbating existing labor shortages, making it tougher for small municipal agencies to quickly staff up if people are sick or decide to leave.\", \"\\u201cRural governments are small by design,\\u201d he said.\", \"Marvell was never a big city, but longtime residents say it used to be a more lively community. In the middle of the last century, a commuter railway stopped in downtown, where there were, at one point, three hotels. Then the commuter trains became cargo rail, and by the late 1970s, that was gone, too.\", \"Now, the town\\u2019s two grocery stores and three clothing stores are gone. Nearly all of the remaining businesses \\u2014 including a handful of chain convenience stores and gas stations \\u2014 line the highway that ushers travelers toward Helena, the county seat and home to the King Biscuit Blues Festival. The gathering brings in hundreds of thousands of music lovers hoping to experience Delta blues in the area\\u2019s biggest annual event.\", \"(Marvell\\u2019s own hope for luring tourists is the rustic, wood-sided boyhood home of Levon Helm, the former drummer and singer for the rock group the Band. The home opened to visitors in 2019 after it was moved from a smaller outpost known as Turkey Scratch into Marvell, where Mr. Helm attended school.)\", \"The pandemic has disrupted more than local government in Marvell.\", \"Matthew Catlett, the owner of three auto and agricultural supply stores in Marvell and the surrounding area, said that in the early days of shutdowns, farmers and residents were able to take on projects they had been putting off, which translated into more business.\", \"But now, amid the Omicron-driven surge, Mr. Catlett said he is starting to feel a pinch in new ways. Supply chain problems have caused backups and shortages in everything from microchips and car parts to Pepsi products. An outbreak in Memphis has snarled deliveries.\", \"He has had trouble recruiting workers ahead of the busy season for farmers, which starts in March, and he is concerned that new surges of infection are in the future.\", \"\\u201cWe need to get more people in here in case something like that does happen,\\u201d he said.\", \"Bennie Daniels Jr., the town\\u2019s police chief, said the department was already understaffed when he came down with Covid a few days after the mayor tested positive. The department would have as many as four full-time officers and eight part-time if it were fully staffed, but right now, there is half that.\", \"Mr. Daniels has picked up night shifts to help relieve other staff members. He conducts traffic stops, responds to calls about fights involving juveniles and does whatever else is needed.\", \"\\u201cI do everything my guys do, of course,\\u201d he said.\", \"And then his sergeant \\u2014 the other working full-time police officer \\u2014 got sick, too. Mr. Daniels asked the county sheriff\\u2019s department and the state to help patrol while he finished his own isolation period. He returned to work, picking up back-to-back shifts, as soon as he was able to. This week, he estimated his days were 18 to 20 hours long.\", \"\\u201cMy hope is that one day we\\u2019ll get a handle on this thing,\\u201d he said. In the meantime, he got his officers a raise to $15 per hour from $13.\", \"Mr. Daniels said that everyone in the department is vaccinated, and that he didn\\u2019t encounter much pushback.\", \"Still, the town has not been immune from the political divisions and misinformation around the pandemic that have afflicted communities of all sizes. Mr. Guest, the mayor, said the backlash against encouraging residents to get vaccinated prompted him to quit Facebook for a while.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m getting chewed out by people I grew up with,\\u201d said Mr. Guest, a lifelong resident who describes his ascent to the city\\u2019s top job almost like he was drafted. \\u201cThere are times where I just want to be a mailman.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"badc89e87c2211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"badc89e87c2211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
