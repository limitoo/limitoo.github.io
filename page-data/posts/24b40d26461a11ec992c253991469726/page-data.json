As suggested by the video's caption, it was filmed near ski resort Squaw Valley, now known as Palisades Tahoe, and Truckee\\u2014both by Lake Tahoe.\", \"In the video, the bear entered the 7-Eleven through the front door and held it open for the duration of its visit. The bear even managed to somewhat follow COVID protocol, by accidentally triggering the hand sanitizer machine, which just missed its face.\", \"The bear appeared to begin to lean over to the freezer but ultimately gave up. 7-Eleven's official TikTok account even got in on the action, writing in a comment on the video: \\\"He wants a blue raspBEARy slushie.\\\"\", \"The video can also be seen in full here.\", \"An off-camera woman filming can be heard screaming and shouting at the bear to \\\"get out\\\". Official Squaw Valley advice recommends residents \\\"make noise by clapping, whistling or singing to scare away bears that might be close by.\\\"\", \"\\\"Your bad singing voice is a great deterrent even if your partner hates it. If you do see a bear, and it does not see you, back away slowly and don't run even if you want to. Never turn your back to the bear and don't make eye contact. Speak in a loud, calm voice giving the bear time to realize you're there and time for it to move on. If a bear does approach you, make yourself look big by lifting and waving your arms and yelling at the bear,\\\" it further advises.\", \"Later videos showed the bear turning to the trash outside after leaving the store. The employees again attempted to deter the bear by throwing objects at it.\", \"The United States Department of Agriculture recommends visitors prevent bears from finding food in any human areas, including trash cans, in order to stop them associating humans as a food source and causing potentially dangerous situations when they become habituated.\", \"As noted by many viewers, the 7-Eleven bear had a visible yellow tag on its ear, leading to concerns that it could be an \\\"escapee or repeat offender\\\". In some parks and locations, rangers will tag the ears of bears that have approached or caused problems for humans, in order to keep track of the times they've done it. This might not be the case with this bear though.\", \"In the Tahoe area, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife has teamed up with California State Parks and the U.S. Forest Service to trap, tag and haze bears with loud noises and bean bags. They do this in order to attempt to scare them away from returning to heavily populated areas.\", \"The bears are then tagged and tracked, adding them to a genetic database in order to track their response to the hazing and whether or not they learn from it. They are also hoping to learn whether or not bears are teaching their \\\"problem behaviors\\\" to their children too.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932244/bear-7-eleven-store.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Left: Stock image of a Yellowstone black bear.
