But economic activity will also be dampened by other safety measures \\u2014 from vaccine passports in France and Switzerland to a requirement to work from home four days a week in Belgium.\", \"\\u201cWe are expecting a bumpy winter season,\\u201d said Stefan Kooths, a research director of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany. \\u201cThe pandemic now seems to be affecting the economy more negatively than we originally thought.\\u201d\", \"The tough lockdowns that swept Europe during the early months of the pandemic last year ended up shrinking economic output by nearly 15 percent. Buoyed by a raft of government support to businesses and the unemployed, most of those countries managed to scramble back and recoup their losses after vaccines were introduced, infection rates tumbled and restrictions eased.\", \"In September, economists optimistically declared that Europe had reached a turning point. In recent weeks, the main threats to the economy seemed to stem from a post-lockdown exuberance that was causing supply-chain bottlenecks, energy-price increases and inflation worries. And widespread vaccinations were expected to defang the pandemic\\u2019s bite so that people could continue to freely gather to shop, dine out and travel.\", \"What was not expected was a series of tough government restrictions. A highly contagious strain \\u2014 aided by some resistance to vaccines and flagging support for other anti-infection measures like masks \\u2014 has enabled the coronavirus to make a comeback in some regions.\", \"\\u201cThe lower vaccination rates are, the gloomier the economic outlook is for this winter term,\\u201d Mr. Kooths said.\", \"Roughly two-thirds of Europe\\u2019s population has been vaccinated, but rates vary widely from country to country. Only a quarter of the population in Bulgaria has received a shot, for example, compared with 81 percent in Portugal, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.\", \"Before they were ordered shut, stores in Austria were already suffering a 25 percent loss in revenue for November compared with the same period in 2019, the country\\u2019s retail trade association said on Monday. Although the last shopping Saturday before the lockdown \\u2014 stores in Austria are closed on Sunday \\u2014 was stronger than that day two years ago, the group said, it would not be enough to make up for the losses expected in the coming weeks.\", \"Hotels were not faring much better in the week before the start of the lockdown, with one of every two bookings canceled, Austria\\u2019s hotel association, \\u00d6.H.V., said.\", \"Still, the overall outlook is not nearly as dire as it was last year. Although several analysts have shaved their forecasts for October, November and December, growth is still expected to be positive, with the yearly increase hovering around the 5 percent mark. Jobless rates have dropped and, in some areas, businesses are complaining of labor shortages.\", \"Austria\\u2019s response, to impose a three-week lockdown \\u2014 which shuts all stores except those providing basic necessities, allows restaurants to serve only carryout and requires people to stay home except for essential activities \\u2014 is not necessarily a bellwether of what other governments across Europe will do. Leaders in France and Britain signaled last week that they were not planning new shutdowns.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re not at that point,\\u201d Sajid Javid, the British health secretary, said on Sunday. While there can\\u2019t be complacency, he added that he hoped people could \\u201clook forward to Christmas together.\\u201d\", \"Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Economics, said that while it was clear that restrictions and lockdowns had a significant and immediate impact on the economy, limited and intermittent closings \\u2014 like those that already exist in some countries \\u2014 were less likely to put a huge dent in overall growth.\", \"Rising infection rates will also push concerns over inflation \\u2014 at least in the near future \\u2014 \\u201ca little bit into the background,\\u201d he said.\", \"Much more difficult to assess, though, are the consequences of widespread restrictions on the unvaccinated or vaccine mandates.\", \"For individual businesses and regions, however, even the current limits could prove devastating.\", \"The weeks leading up to Christmas Day are among the most important shopping days in Austria and Germany, where people gather at outdoor markets to eat, drink and buy gifts. The region\\u2019s traditional holiday markets, which normally open from late November until Dec. 24, are also an important tourist draw, and generate wider revenue through hotel bookings and other cultural events.\", \"Last year, many markets were completely shut down, so sellers and buyers were looking forward to this year.\", \"In Vienna, the market on Maria Theresien Platz opened on Wednesday, its wooden stalls decorated with evergreen boughs and fairy lights. But the vendors were forced to shut down after only four days.\", \"Maria Kissova stood amid piles of tablecloths, pillow covers and lace ornaments she had brought in from neighboring Slovakia, where she employs several women to sew the crafts. This year was her first time coming to Vienna, a trip that required months of planning and paperwork. With the lockdown, she faced the prospect of only several days\\u2019 worth of shopping, if the market is allowed to reopen as planned in mid-December.\", \"\\u201cIt was a shock\\u201d when the lockdown was announced, she said, adding that it was too early to predict the scale of the losses she could incur. \\u201cWe just have to accept it.\\u201d\", \"For Daniel Zieman, who ran a gift stand across the square between Vienna\\u2019s Natural History and Art History Museums, the story was the same. But he worried about the staff at the restaurant serving typical Austrian fare that he runs on the edge of town, many of whom count on the tips coming in from waiting tables in the normally busy season. Lost tips won\\u2019t be included in the government subsidies that will help keep people afloat.\", \"\\u201cMany of our staff have children, and you count on a certain percent from these tips every month,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat won\\u2019t be there.\\u201d\", \"The holiday season is when many restaurants do their biggest business, with companies holding end-of-year events, he said. \\u201cThat is really good business, with 30 to 40 people who eat and drink and drink again and eat again. It\\u2019s a real shame,\\u201d he said.\", \"The Czech Republic and Slovakia have also imposed new restrictions. In Germany, some states have introduced partial lockdowns, and starting Wednesday, the unvaccinated will be required to show a negative Covid test before going to work.\", \"By the end of this winter, pretty much everyone in Germany \\u201cwill be vaccinated, cured or dead,\\u201d Jens Spahn, the health minister, said on Monday.\", \"A nationwide closure in Germany, the continent\\u2019s largest economy, is unlikely at the moment, but Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, warned that one there would drag down all of Europe. \\u201cIf Germany locks down, Europe is going to go back into recession,\\u201d he said.\", \"In France, Europe\\u2019s second-largest economy, President Emmanuel Macron is loath to reverse economic gains when a major election is scheduled in April. Despite warnings by health experts that another wave of coronavirus is hitting France \\u201cwith lightning speed,\\u201d Mr. Macron said last week that he wouldn\\u2019t close parts of the economy again or follow Austria.\", \"Nearly 70 percent of the French population has been double vaccinated, and the country imposed a health pass earlier this year requiring people to show proof of vaccination to travel on trains and planes and enter restaurants, cinemas and large shopping centers.\", \"The government will now require a booster dose for people 65 or older for the pass to remain valid, and France\\u2019s Health Defense Council will meet on Wednesday with Mr. Macron to discuss other options to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\", \"The government, a spokesman said this week, is bringing \\u201cthe weight of restrictions to bear on nonvaccinated people rather than vaccinated people.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"de759d524c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"de759d524c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}},
