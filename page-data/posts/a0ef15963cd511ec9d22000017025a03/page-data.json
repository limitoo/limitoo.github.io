He gained in the cities, the suburbs and rural areas. He gained in the east and west. He made inroads in precincts with both white and nonwhite voters.\", \"It\\u2019s an unusually simple picture for such a noteworthy result. When a candidate outperforms expectations, it\\u2019s often accompanied by a big breakthrough among a particular demographic group; when a candidate disappoints, they still usually have a few bright spots. There were no bright spots for the Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe, but no breakthroughs for Mr. Youngkin, either.\", \"The broad shift to the right could indicate widespread revulsion against Democrats, or it could simply be a sign that longstanding trends have finally run their course. Or perhaps it\\u2019s because Mr. Youngkin adopted a message that appealed to the kinds of voters who have gradually been fleeing the Republican Party.\", \"Whatever the reason, it makes it harder to tell the usual story about why Democrats lost on Tuesday.\"]","href_hash":"a0ef15963cd511ec9d22000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a0ef15963cd511ec9d22000017025a03"}},
