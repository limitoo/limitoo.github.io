But FEMA said that the first trailers \\u2014 boxy structures also known as manufactured housing units \\u2014 wouldn\\u2019t arrive until mid-November.\", \"Instead, the agency offered Ms. Manuel a voucher to reimburse her for a hotel or her rent elsewhere. But many of the area\\u2019s already limited available houses and hotels were destroyed or full of recovery workers. That left Ms. Manuel and her two siblings, whose mobile homes were also left uninhabitable, seeking shelter at the closest hotel they could find, a two-hour drive west in Abbeville, La.\", \"Ms. Manuel is still there, making the commute back home multiple times a week to salvage what she can. She and many of her neighbors who were devastated at losing everything are now frustrated at the lack of safe housing options near their homes and jobs.\", \"As climate change contributes to more punishing natural disasters across the country, federal agencies have repeatedly failed to provide temporary housing swiftly in their wake, exposing wide gaps in disaster policy. In fact, since Hurricane Ida, a makeshift effort by the state of Louisiana has been more successful in providing short-term shelter to storm victims than FEMA has been.\", \"\\u201cThis process of bringing in units is complicated, it\\u2019s complex, it takes time,\\u201d said Keith Turi, assistant administrator of recovery at FEMA. The agency has secured enough units to house everyone who needs one after Hurricane Ida, he said, but the challenge is how and where to put them. \", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re each like miniature construction projects,\\u201d Mr. Turi said, noting that topography, debris and utility hookups can present obstacles at each site. It\\u2019s expensive, too: Each unit can cost about $200,000 altogether, according to disaster housing experts.\", \"It wasn\\u2019t until November of 2021 that every resident was placed in temporary housing after Hurricane Laura hit southwest Louisiana in August of 2020, though many residents were put in units before then. After Hurricane Harvey hit the Houston area in August of 2017, it wasn\\u2019t until the following June that every resident was placed in a unit. \", \"At issue is not just competence but difficult policy choices still being debated. Is supplying housing for disaster victims the appropriate role for government? If so, which level of government? And how long after a disaster do victims need housing assistance?\", \"\\u201cIt can be done if there\\u2019s a will,\\u201d said Laurie Schoeman, a disaster recovery specialist for Enterprise Community Partners, a nonprofit. But FEMA has steered away from direct housing toward rental and hotel vouchers.\", \"\\u201cFEMA doesn\\u2019t want to be in the business of housing,\\u201d Ms. Schoeman said.\", \"Caught in the middle are people like Ms. Manuel and her neighbors, some of whom have resorted to sleeping in cars or tents or inside moldy, damaged homes. Some have doubled or tripled up with family and friends.\", \"\\u201cIt seems like they would already have steps, like: This is what we do when something happens,\\u201d said Ms. Manuel. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like they\\u2019re trying to figure out what to do next instead of already knowing.\\u201d\", \"More than three months after Hurricane Ida tore through coastal Louisiana, likely thousands of residents of the hardest hit bayou communities southwest of New Orleans remain displaced. Just 126 households out of the 4,465 found eligible by FEMA for direct housing had moved into units, according to a FEMA spokeswoman. There is no estimated timeline for completion.\", \"After months of waiting for FEMA housing, Ms. Manuel\\u2019s older brother and sister finally received help from a different source: The state provided them each with a trailer, part of a new program to meet the acute housing need. The program has rolled out much more quickly than FEMA\\u2019s: By the beginning of December about 1,200 families had moved into Louisiana\\u2019s trailers \\u2014 campers that can be towed by a vehicle \\u2014 with another 800 expected to move in over the coming weeks. But the program, started from scratch, faced delays, too.\", \"On Nov. 10, more than two months after the storm, just 368 families had moved into trailers. And while the more compact trailers may be easier to set up, they are less sturdy over the long term. Plus, they can be used for only six months under the state\\u2019s current agreement with FEMA.\", \"Given the logistical challenges of setting up direct housing, FEMA views trailers as a last resort, Mr. Turi said.\", \"In the aftermath of several major hurricanes in 2017 and 2018, FEMA provided rental assistance to 745,660 households, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office. It provided direct housing \\u2014 through trailers, mostly\\u2014 to just 5,368.\", \"But in the wake of far-ranging disasters like Hurricane Ida that cut a wide swath in the available housing, housing experts say these assistance funds are a weak substitute for direct housing, especially in rural areas with few hotels. \", \"FEMA\\u2019s shift away from direct housing began after Hurricane Katrina, when trailers used to house the displaced were found to have high levels of formaldehyde. Since then, when direct housing has been necessary, the agency has tended toward larger, sturdier manufactured housing units and abided by strict rules and regulations, and an often lengthy process for determining eligibility.\", \" But the delays in providing temporary housing have subjected disaster victims to other dangers.\", \"Christine Ledet spent nearly three months using a generator for electricity after the storm\\u2019s winds lifted her mobile home off its pilings and moved it eight feet away. She received $13,000 from FEMA for repairs, she said \\u2014 enough to put it back in place. But the money is not enough to repair the windows that were blown in, the electric box that was damaged or the mold spreading on her walls, she said. Her appeal is pending.\", \"\\u201cThe people that really need the trailers and the campers are the ones that don\\u2019t have nothing,\\u201d said Ms. Ledet, who\\u2019s been sharing her damaged home with her granddaughter and daughter-in-law. \\u201cAnd they\\u2019re being overlooked.\\u201d\", \"With every passing week that residents wait for temporary housing, the prospect of rebuilding falls further out of reach.\", \"Over a year after Hurricane Laura, Lake Charles, La., still looks like a ghost town, said Brandi Weldon, a lifelong resident.\", \"In the 10 months before Ms. Weldon\\u2019s FEMA trailer arrived after Hurricane Laura tore the roof off her home in Lake Charles, La., she and her sons bounced among the couches of family and friends and hotel beds. Moving around so much was not just difficult but dangerous for Ms. Weldon, who is diabetic. She struggled to set up her home dialysis equipment every night and often had to rely on fast food, which led her blood pressure to spike.\", \"\\u201cA lot of people were in a predicament to where they had no choice but to move away,\\u201d Ms. Weldon said. \", \"\\u201cOur federal programs are federal programs at the end of the day,\\u201d said Lauren Lefebvre, public affairs director for a FEMA regional office that includes Louisiana. \\u201cThey can oftentimes involve a process, there\\u2019s paperwork, there\\u2019s multiple things you have to do to be able to take advantage of it. And that might not always be the best thing for a survivor.\\u201d\", \"That bureaucracy, she said, hampers the agency\\u2019s ability to quickly deploy housing and makes it hard for the agency to adapt its disaster response to particular circumstances.\", \"To get around some of this red tape, FEMA has recommended that states design and implement their own temporary housing programs when they are necessary, to be reimbursed by FEMA.\", \"But state and local governments have had difficulty standing up temporary housing programs that would comply with FEMA\\u2019s often complex reimbursement policies.\", \"Even Louisiana, among the states most frequently hit by climate disasters, had no temporary housing plans before Hurricane Ida hit.\", \"\\u201cHousing is not anywhere in our scope \\u2014 that\\u2019s always been a federal mission here,\\u201d said Mike Steele, communications director with the Governor\\u2019s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness.\", \"Emergency management experts say that some responsibility for temporary housing necessarily falls on the shoulders of local governments, who know their communities and can more easily identify vulnerable residents and group sites for trailers. \", \"But for many local governments, especially smaller ones on limited budgets, this sort of planning isn\\u2019t a priority and often conflicts with FEMA\\u2019s approach. \", \"Junia Howell, a sociologist at the University of Pittsburgh, said that when FEMA relies on a reimbursement model but doesn\\u2019t provide state and local governments \\u2014 especially those with fewer resources \\u2014 the tools they need to implement their own programs, the system breaks down. \\u201cAnd it breaks down over and over and over again,\\u201d she said.\", \"By the time many disaster survivors make it into FEMA housing, they are confronted with a new problem: where to go next.\", \"Ms. Weldon, who moved into her FEMA trailer in June, has less than three months until the FEMA program expires, 18 months after a federal disaster was declared for Hurricane Laura.\", \"In some cases, FEMA trailers can be purchased by recipients for longer-term use. But often, the trailers aren\\u2019t compliant with floodplain or wildfire hazard restrictions, leaving FEMA to auction them off for cheap after the disaster period.\", \"With much of the housing stock of Lake Charles still awaiting repairs, and the few available apartments going for hundreds of dollars a month more than they were before the storm, Ms. Weldon is out of options.The long-term struggles after Hurricane Laura are a foreboding message to residents and advocates reeling from Hurricane Ida.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re going to end up in the same situation we\\u2019re in now but worse, because they won\\u2019t have the trailers to live in,\\u201d said Genie Trahan-Ardoin, who has been providing assistance door to door with the Helio Foundation, a local nonprofit.\", \"\\u201cEverybody you talk to, you ask them, \\u2018What are you going to do?\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cThey say, \\u2018I don\\u2019t know.\\u2019 \\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8f41ec6f55a411ec83453d5827b51823"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8f41ec6f55a411ec83453d5827b51823"}},
