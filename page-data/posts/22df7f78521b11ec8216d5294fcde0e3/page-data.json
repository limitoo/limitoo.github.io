He was 82.\", \"His wife, the art historian Libby Lumpkin, said the cause was heart disease.\", \"Drawing on his decades of disparate and often debauched living, Mr. Hickey\\u2019s criticism was at once erudite and quotidian. He dashed from Derrida to Liberace, zone defense to Cezanne, rejecting any distinction between high and low culture and insisting on the extreme subjectivity of aesthetic standards.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s no difference between the highest art and the lowest art except for the audience it appeals to,\\u201d he told The Los Angeles Times in 2002. \\u201cBad taste is real taste, of course, and good taste is the residue of someone else\\u2019s privilege.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Hickey, who taught criticism at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, burst onto the art-world scene in 1993 with the publication of \\u201cThe Invisible Dragon: Four Essays on Beauty.\\u201d The book did many things, but chief among them was to declare that \\u201cthe issue of the \\u201990s will be beauty\\u201d \\u2014 a claim that fell like a hydrogen bomb amid the raging culture wars, in which terms like \\u201cbeauty\\u201d had been cast aside as racist, sexist and elitist.\", \"A chain-smoking white man given to all-black clothing ensembles and name-dropping artists like Robert Rauschenberg and Ed Ruscha, Mr. Hickey seemed typecast for the part of the retrograde renegade. His offhand, frequently off-color jokes \\u2014 \\u201cI like the art world. There are a lot of gay people and attractive women with low-cut dresses,\\u201d he told Texas Monthly in 2009 \\u2014 appeared to reinforce the point.\", \"But his writing eluded easy pigeonholing. Beauty, he argued, was not an innate quality, but an aspect of how people responded to a work of art, and an avenue toward understanding its meaning. It was subjective and quicksilver, and it created the give-and-take that in turn generated the cultural consensus necessary in a democratic society.\", \"\\u201cThe Invisible Dragon\\u201d and a subsequent book, \\u201cAir Guitar: Essays on Art and Democracy\\u201d (1997), established Mr. Hickey as one of the most interesting and sought-after critics of his generation. He lectured widely, wrote dozens of exhibition catalogs and organized several gallery shows.\", \"He won the Frank Jewett Mather Award, the country\\u2019s highest honor for art criticism, in 1994, and in 2001 he received a \\u201cgenius\\u201d grant from the MacArthur Foundation. Ever the rebel, he later said he used the grant money to learn to play Texas Hold\\u2019em poker in Las Vegas.\", \"\\u201cArt is not good for you,\\u201d he told The Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2001. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not necessarily therapeutic. It\\u2019s supposed to be exciting. It\\u2019s not penicillin. It\\u2019s more like cocaine. It\\u2019s a drug. It gets you excited and makes you want more.\\u201d\", \"David Charles Hickey was born on Dec. 5, 1938, in Fort Worth, Tex. He and his family moved frequently \\u2014 his father, David Cecil Hickey, worked for a string of auto distribution centers while eking out a career as a jazz musician.\", \"Young David was especially influenced by a year spent in Southern California, where he learned to surf and where his father often brought him along to practice sessions. The experience left him with a lifelong love of jazz; he later said he learned to write by listening to the \\u201clong, lapidary lines\\u201d of Chet Baker.\", \"His father\\u2019s California sojourn failed, and a few years after returning to Fort Worth, Mr. Hickey took his own life. David\\u2019s mother, Helen (Balch) Hickey, who worked in her family\\u2019s flower shop and at nearby Texas Christian University, sent him to live with his grandparents.\", \"He enrolled at Southern Methodist University, in Dallas, majoring in engineering and math, but later transferred to Texas Christian, where he graduated with a degree in English in 1961. He later pursued a Ph.D. in linguistics at the University of Texas, focusing on French post-structuralist theory, but left in 1967 before completing his dissertation.\", \"Instead, he and his wife, Mary Jane (Taylor) Hickey, borrowed $10,000 to open an art gallery in Austin, which they called A Clean Well-Lighted Place, after the short story by Ernest Hemingway.\", \"Though the gallery lasted only two years, the experience gave Mr. Hickey a perspective on art as an object of commerce, its value determined by competing notions of beauty \\u2014 an approach that would guide his later views as a critic.\", \"The Hickeys moved to New York, where Mr. Hickey briefly ran the Reese Palley Gallery in SoHo; he quit after his boss insisted on showing work by Yoko Ono, an artist he despised. A few years as the executive editor of Art in America introduced him to journalism, and after he stepped down from that job, he spent several years writing freelance articles for outlets such as the Village Voice, Rolling Stone and Harper\\u2019s.\", \"It was the era of New Journalism, dominated by big, brash personalities like Hunter S. Thompson and Lester Bangs, two writers Mr. Hickey counted as close friends. He mixed business and pleasure, partying with musicians including Aerosmith and Waylon Jennings and building relationships with Mr. Warhol, Mr. Ruscha and other artists.\", \"His rock 'n' roll lifestyle, with a side helping of sex and drugs, soon broke up his marriage. He moved to Nashville, where he wrote songs for a music publisher and on the side for Marshall Chapman, whom he also dated and for whom, on tour, he sometimes played rhythm guitar.\", \"Eventually, the strain of hard living ground him down, and in 1978 he returned to Fort Worth, where he lived with his mother and tried to get clean. He became the arts editor for The Fort Worth Star-Telegram and began to build a reputation as a serious voice in art criticism. In 1992 he moved to Las Vegas, and to academia.\", \"Mr. Hickey took quickly to teaching, and to his new hometown. The city seemed to embody everything he dreamed of for a democratic culture \\u2014 art galleries nestled beside giant casino-hotels, opera singers trading stages with lion tamers, and all of it filtered through the hustle and bustle of commerce.\", \"\\u201cLas Vegas is a risk-oriented culture,\\u201d he told The New York Times in 2002. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re not taking any chances, you\\u2019re not having any fun.\\u201d\", \"He married Dr. Lumpkin in 1993. She taught alongside her husband at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, for several years, and in 2010 they moved to the University of New Mexico and settled in Santa Fe.\", \"Along with his wife, he is survived by his brother, Michael Hickey.\", \"Facing health problems, Mr. Hickey retired from teaching in 2012. But he kept writing, including on Facebook. Two edited collections of his posts, \\u201cWasted Words\\u201d and \\u201cDust Bunnies,\\u201d appeared in 2016. Another book, \\u201c25 Women: Essays on Their Art,\\u201d also published in 2016, raised the eyebrows of those who still viewed him as an unreconstructed male chauvinist.\", \"And he continued to poke back at all the forces and institutions that he insisted had ruined the art world he had known as a younger man. He held identity politics in particular disdain, he told The Los Angeles Times in 2014, for dividing otherwise like-minded people into antagonistic categories.\", \"\\u201cIdentity politics tribalized the art underground and broke up the dissonant tone of it \\u2014 a tribe of women, a tribe of Black people, a tribe of gay people,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt used to be all of us, together, just down in the dirt.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"22df7f78521b11ec8216d5294fcde0e3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"22df7f78521b11ec8216d5294fcde0e3"}},
