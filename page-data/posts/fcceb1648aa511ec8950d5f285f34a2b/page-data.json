Set almost entirely within the confines of an elementary school and its grounds, it takes place in an unidentified Belgian neighborhood at an institution that\\u2019s as colorless, generic and unwelcoming as any educational sausage factory. There, girls and boys are turned into students, playmates, friends, adversaries, future citizens and dutiful workers. They study and obey but sometimes they also resist.\", \"It\\u2019s the first day of school when you meet Nora (an astonishing Maya Vanderbeque), a plaintive 7-year-old with short hair and worried eyes. She\\u2019s hugging her brother, Abel (G\\u00fcnter Duret, a heartbreaker), who\\u2019s slightly older and a touch taller, her eyes beginning to flood as her father (Karim Leklou) silently stands by. Her face is bunched in a knot of anxiety and her grip is tenacious, unyielding. As the children clutch at each other, their bodies fused and foreheads touching, Abel whispers words of comfort. \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry,\\u201d he gently tells Nora, just before a supervisor pulls them apart. \\u201cI\\u2019ll see you at break time.\\u201d\", \"This reunion never occurs. Instead \\u2014 as happens recurrently in this fierce, intelligent movie \\u2014 grown-ups get in the way, blinkered by their obeisance to rules, regulations and pedagogical imperatives. Forced to eat lunch separately from Abel, Nora sits down with some other girls; in time, she also settles into school. She makes friends and expands her horizons: She learns how to tie her shoes. \\u201cGood job,\\u201d a girl says, expressing support with a tinge of adult condescension. But school also brings harrowing trouble when Abel becomes the target of vicious bullying \\u2014 for Nora, it is a devastating introduction to the larger world.\", \"This is the first feature from the writer-director Laura Wandel, and it\\u2019s a knockout, as flawlessly constructed as it is harrowing. By the time the first scene has ended, Wandel has set the anxious mood, introduced her characters, established the visual design and created a richly inhabited world that\\u2019s disturbingly familiar. (If you don\\u2019t flash on your childhood with at least a few pangs while watching it, you are made of stronger stuff than I am.) From the sights and sounds of Nora being escorted into school \\u2014 the image darkens as the sound of children\\u2019s voices rise to a roar \\u2014 you are already primed for the worst.\", \"You\\u2019re also firmly in Wandel\\u2019s grip. The image of distressed children can\\u2019t help but seize your attention (and quickly stoke your sympathies), but the scene\\u2019s tenderness also holds you. In \\u201cPlayground,\\u201d the camera never points down at Nora, but is positioned at her eye level, as if it were another child. This creates an immediate, palpable intimacy, a gentleness that\\u2019s accentuated by the tightness of the shot, the soft light and Nora\\u2019s tears. You\\u2019re at her side, and that\\u2019s where you remain. You see what she sees in her immediate orbit, but you also see how she sees, allowing you to step into her limited sphere and experience her narrow sightlines.\", \"In \\u201cPlayground,\\u201d Nora is the narrative pivot, and because she\\u2019s most often positioned in the center of the frame, she is also the movie\\u2019s visual center point, its lodestar. But what she understands about her new, uncharted world is sharply circumscribed. She sees but doesn\\u2019t always know, and while you may grasp the situation, Wandel also shrewdly withholds information, which puts you on the same uncertain existential level as Nora. Because Nora is so tiny there are moments when you don\\u2019t even see the faces or upper bodies of the adults, a vantage that recalls the few peeks of grown-ups in early Charlie Brown comics.\", \"The story gathers momentum as the bullying dangerously escalates amid short scenes of Nora\\u2019s everyday school life. She goes to class, reads and writes, and endures time on a balance beam and in a swimming pool. She watches, and she learns. In one scene, a teacher orders her and other girls to circle their arms in different directions, an exercise mostly in submission. The school is shaping minds, but Wandel reminds you that it\\u2019s also disciplining bodies. On the playground, the children \\u2014 through their play and their sadism \\u2014 mimic these adult lessons in power, creating a different educational regime.\", \"A work of striking integrity and force, \\u201cPlayground\\u201d owes a debt to the influential Belgian filmmaker brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, both in its formal and thematic concerns. As in their movies, Wandel is charting a moral awakening and focusing on the questions that many movies rarely engage. How do we love, and why? How do we become, who do we become? Wandel is telling the story of one child, a tiny planet spinning in a mysterious, often confusing, unsettled universe. (The original title is \\u201cUn Monde.\\u201d) But she\\u2019s also telling a story that in its piercing, sensitive detail and life-shaping arc is as familiar as yours and mine.\"]","href_hash":"fcceb1648aa511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fcceb1648aa511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
