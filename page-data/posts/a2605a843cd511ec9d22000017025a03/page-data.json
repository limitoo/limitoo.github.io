In February, Smartmatic sued Rupert Murdoch\\u2019s Fox Corporation and several Fox anchors on similar grounds, as well as two of Mr. Trump\\u2019s lawyers, Sidney Powell and Rudolph W. Giuliani.\", \"\\u201cWe are holding them accountable for what they tell their audience,\\u201d J. Erik Connolly, a lawyer for Smartmatic, said in an interview.\", \"Dominion has sued Fox, Newsmax, One America News, Ms. Powell, Mr. Giuliani, and Mike Lindell, the chief executive of MyPillow.\", \"Smartmatic and Dominion were both accused by pro-Trump forces, without evidence, of rigging vote tallies in key states to swing the election to Joseph R. Biden Jr., part of a large-scale effort by Mr. Trump\\u2019s allies to cast doubt on the 2020 results. Those conspiracies have only expanded in the year since Mr. Biden won, as leading Republican officials and media personalities have continued to raise doubts about Mr. Trump\\u2019s defeat.\", \"The lawsuits are one tactic being used to address an urgent civic matter: how to curb misinformation that has flowed copiously from right-wing news and opinion outlets.\", \"For Newsmax and One America News \\u2014 relatively fledgling outlets that have nurtured small but devoted followings \\u2014 the stakes may be existential. Unlike Fox, which is hugely profitable, Newsmax and One America News are poorly positioned to absorb significant financial penalties.\", \"Requests for comment on Wednesday from Newsmax and One America News were not immediately returned.\", \"In the two lawsuits \\u2014 filed against Newsmax in Delaware and against One America News in Washington, D.C. \\u2014 Smartmatic says that the networks aired dozens of reports accusing the company of participating in a conspiracy to rig the election against Mr. Trump. Those accusations came even though Smartmatic provided its services only in Los Angeles County, and nowhere else, in the 2020 election.\", \"In its suit against Newsmax, Smartmatic says the news organization waged its campaign in order to siphon away viewers from its larger rival Fox. Smartmatic also accuses One America News of having knowingly published disinformation after the company warned it to stop. \", \"Legal experts said the lawsuits could put both organizations in a difficult position.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re both powerful lawsuits,\\u201d said Floyd Abrams, a renowned First Amendment lawyer. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s unlikely that the defendants will make strong arguments that what they carried was accurate.\\u201d\", \"Still, defamation cases are difficult to prove and, as in the Fox case, Smartmatic is likely to have to show that the two upstart networks acted maliciously and recklessly by airing false statements they knew to be false.\", \"Fox has filed a motion to dismiss the Smartmatic litigation, arguing that Mr. Trump\\u2019s claims of electoral fraud were matters of significant public interest and handled fairly by the cable channels Fox News and Fox Business. \\u201cAn attempt by a sitting president to challenge the result of an election is objectively newsworthy,\\u201d Fox wrote in its response. Oral arguments on the motion took place in August, but a judge has yet to deliver a ruling.\", \"Mr. Connolly, the Smartmatic lawyer, said that Newsmax and One America News \\u201chad no evidence to support anything they were saying. Their guests provided them no evidence for what they were saying. And you couple that with the reams of publicly available information contradicting what is being said.\\u201d\", \"One America News and Newsmax saw their standings rise with conservatives after the election last year, while Fox News\\u2019s ratings dropped after it was the first major network to project that Mr. Biden had won the election in Arizona. But in March, a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center showed that Fox News retained a far broader reach over Republicans and American viewers overall.\"]","href_hash":"a2605a843cd511ec9d22000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a2605a843cd511ec9d22000017025a03"}},
