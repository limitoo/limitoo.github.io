Mania, masochism and a sex toy whittled from a figurine of the Blessed Virgin, they\\u2019re all here and more in this tale of a randy nun whose religious visions and lustful cravings are rolled into a single ball of blasphemy. In other words, Verhoeven might have aged (he\\u2019s now 83), but his love of the lurid has dimmed not one bit.\", \"Nor has his eye for juicy material. Ducking for cover behind the familiar legend, \\u201cInspired by real events\\u201d (documented in Judith C. Brown\\u2019s 1986 book \\u201cImmodest Acts\\u201d), the maestro who brought us \\u201cBasic Instinct\\u201d (1992) and \\u201cShowgirls\\u201d (1995) plunges us into 17th-century Italy where piety and pestilence are duking it out. Inside the walls of one Tuscan convent, though, all is serene \\u2014 at least until a statue of the Virgin topples on top of a child novice named Benedetta (Elena Plonka). Immediately, the miraculously unharmed youngster latches on to Our Lady\\u2019s bared plaster breast: To Benedetta, earthly and spiritual ecstasy are one and the same.\", \"By the time she\\u2019s 18, Benedetta (now played by the gorgeous Virginie Efira) is experiencing erotic visions of a naked Jesus, as sexless as a Ken doll, instructing her to remove her clothing. Her suddenly flowering stigmata and belief that she has a hotline to the Almighty have alienated her fellow nuns, especially when she ousts the convent\\u2019s calculating Abbess (a sly Charlotte Rampling) by promising to pray the plague away from the terrified townsfolk. So when Benedetta\\u2019s dalliance with a fiery novitiate (Daphne Patakia) \\u2014 who has been given sanctuary from her rapey father and brothers \\u2014 is discovered, the Church\\u2019s response is conflicted. After all, there\\u2019s money in miracles.\", \"Unable to decide if its namesake is saint or sinner, genuine mystic or false prophet, \\u201cBenedetta\\u201d is too ambivalent to find focus or resolution. Still, Verhoeven brings more vitality to his work than many filmmakers half his age, and his screenplay (with David Birke) is a tasteless hoot, gleefully cramming the frame with blood, fornication and flagellations galore. Without philosophizing over religious repression \\u2014 or who gets to adjudicate Divine intent \\u2014 the movie presents lesbianism as a middle finger to Church power, insisting that bodily pleasures don\\u2019t have to be bad for the soul. Should this be Verhoeven\\u2019s swan song, that\\u2019s a perfectly fine sign-off.\"]","href_hash":"d1b09a15536c11ec8431677512b10b72"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d1b09a15536c11ec8431677512b10b72"}},
