It had already passed the Senate.\", \"Known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District, it was created in a 1967 deal between the state and the Walt Disney Company.\", \"Governor DeSantis had previously made it clear he will sign the measure into law.

It prohibits any instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity between kindergarten and third grade - when students are roughly between five and nine years old.\", \"It also calls on school districts to avoid LGBT topics \\\"when not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students\\\". The legislation also extends to student support services, including counselling, and grants parents the power to sue schools directly if they believe an educator has broken the law.\", \"Opponents say the law will isolate and stigmatise LGBTQ youth, while supporters say it protects children from age-inappropriate content.\", \"Disney originally remained mum on the bill, but reversed course after it came under pressure from employees to oppose the policy.\", \"After it became law, Disney promised to push for its repeal and fight similar bills across the US.\", \"In response, DeSantis said the company, which has made Florida its home, had \\\"crossed the line\\\".\", \"Earlier this month, Republican lawmakers in the US Congress said they would oppose renewing the company's copyright on Mickey Mouse in 2024 because of Disney's \\\"political and sexual agenda\\\".\", \"-BBC\"]","href_hash":"154ebec0c21711ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"154ebec0c21711ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
