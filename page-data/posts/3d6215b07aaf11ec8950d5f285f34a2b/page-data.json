There are roughly 100,000 Russian troops massed along Ukraine's border, and President Joe Biden said this week that his \\\"guess\\\" is that Russia will \\\"move in\\\" to Ukraine. \", \"Mr. Biden has warned that an invasion would be met with tough new economic sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime, and lead to a \\\"consequential\\\" loss of Russian life.\", \"But amid a lack of clear consensus among the U.S. and its NATO allies over exactly how to deter Russia, or how to respond to any hypothetical incursion into Ukraine, the U.S. is still trying to find a diplomatic solution to this crisis. \", \"The Biden administration is hoping to gauge, through Blinken's Friday meeting with Lavrov, what Putin's intentions really are, and whether there are concessions that both sides could agree to step back from the brink of war, as NATO and Russia continue moving weapons and forces to the border region.\", \"Ukraine's capital of Kyiv is almost 5,000 miles from American soil, but the Biden administration has said the conflict \\u2014 which has simmered in eastern Ukraine since Putin's forces invaded in 2014 and is now threatening to escalate dramatically \\u2014 is no simple regional dispute far from American shores.\\u00a0\", \"It's about protecting democracy, and stopping Russia from turning its neighbors into puppet states, Blinken said this week. \", \"\\\"There is no doubt, let there be no doubt at all, that if Putin makes this choice [to invade Ukraine], Russia will pay a heavy price,\\\" the president said this week.\", \"Moscow denies that it's planning an attack on Ukraine, but new satellite images show the massive buildup of Russian troops and weaponry along the neighboring country's borders.\", \"Mr. Biden has said a Russian incursion might not use conventional tactics, suggesting Putin could instead rely on \\\"paramilitary tactics, so-called grey zone attacks, and actions by soldiers not wearing Russian uniforms.\\\" The U.S. has also voiced concern that Russia could use a so-called \\\"false-flag\\\" operation as a pretext to attack Ukraine.\", \"To step back, Russia is demanding \\\"security guarantees\\\" from NATO. Moscow wants a total withdrawal of NATO troops from Bulgaria and Romania, and for the Western military alliance to promise it will not admit Ukraine \\u2014 or any other former Soviet State \\u2014 as a new member. The U.S. and its partners have called that last demand a non-starter, insisting that NATO membership is for the alliance to decide, not Moscow.\", \"Many believe Putin's real motive is to gain control over as much territory in neighboring nations as possible, by any means necessary.\", \"\\\"He works like a terrorist \\u2014 with nuclear weapons\\u2026 but he's still a terrorist,\\\" Ukrainian political analyst Mykola Davydiuk told CBS News.\\u00a0 \", \"It's been 30 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, but now a European capital is again staring down the barrel of a Russian gun, and Ukrainians are frightened.\", \"\\\"It's not only threaten for Ukraine, it's threaten for all the world,\\\" Kyiv resident Natalia told Williams on Friday.\", \"\\\"We want a normal life, how we want it, not anybody telling us what to do,\\\" said another local, Viktor.\\u00a0\", \"The U.S. is sending up to $200 million worth of emergency military aid to Ukraine and has authorized its European allies to transfer American-made anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to the country. But the U.S. has ruled out sending troop in to bolster Ukraine's forces.\", \"Blinken and Lavrov were expected to give sperate news conferences after their talks in Geneva on Friday. Before heading into the closed-door meeting, both men played down expectations.\", \"\\\"We don't expect to resolve our differences here today,\\\" Blinken told reporters. \\\"But I do hope and expect that we can test whether the path of diplomacy or dialogue remains open.\\\"\", \"\\\"This is a critical moment,\\\" he added.\", \"Lavrov said he didn't \\\"expect a breakthrough at these negotiations either. What we expect is concrete answers to our concrete proposals.\\\"\", \"It wasn't immediately clear whether Blinken was prepared to give Russia any answers to its security demands on Friday, but the chances of Moscow getting the answers it wants, to what it has framed as ultimatums, looked slim. \", \"The big questions are how much common ground Blinken and Lavrov can find to keep the diplomacy going, and how Putin will respond in the coming days to not getting everything he's demanded from the West.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"3d6215b07aaf11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3d6215b07aaf11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
