They did that early last week.\", \"\\\"We've still got a large and very active Omicron outbreak in New Zealand - 13,000 to 14,000 cases a day - yes the numbers are coming down, but also nearly 700 people in hospital around the country and nearly half of those are in Auckland, that's a lot of pressure on our health system.\", \"\\\"Everyone is as keen as anything to get back to normal as soon as we can and that's certainly top of mind for us but it's by no means normal in our healthcare system and that's really where we need to focus our efforts still.\", \"\\\"We want to keep that downward trajectory going.\\\"\", \"He said there was no single number that would lead officials to advise a move to orange.\", \"\\\"Not a specific number, there are a few things we're looking at and one of course is not just the number of people in hospital but the number of new admissions each day ... there's still over 350 people in hospital across the Auckland region.\", \"\\\"Only around 1 percent of our cases end up in hospital so there's quite a significant number of people who are also being looked after in the community - by general practice, by M\\u0101ori and Pacific providers.\\\"\", \"With indoor gathering limits increased to 200 but hospitality still operating on a seated and separated basis, it may seem perverse that house parties can have up to that number but bars are much more restricted. Bloomfield suggested bars would be harder to contact trace.\", \"\\\"One of the things about a private gathering is there's more control over who comes and so you tend to know who the people are ... it's much easier to let people know if someone turns up a positive test.\", \"\\\"Certainly we've known right from early on in the pandemic that those sort of indoor settings with close contact, a lot of people moving around, those are the places where we do see transmission happening, especially in that age group. We've still got high rates of infection in that younger age group.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"6c805d82b49511ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6c805d82b49511ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
