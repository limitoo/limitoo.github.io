You end up spitting out feathers, and the eight-foot fowl just strolls away singing about the alphabet.\", \"In the 2012 election, Mitt Romney repeatedly argued for cutting public-TV subsidies and having the beloved character share the screen with ads \\u2014 \\u201cI\\u2019m afraid Big Bird is going to have to get used to Kellogg\\u2019s Corn Flakes\\u201d \\u2014 opening himself to attacks that he cared more about Wall Street than about \\u201cSesame Street.\\u201d\", \"In November, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, became the latest pol to find the big yellow target irresistible. After the Twitter account for Big Bird announced that the character had gotten a Covid-19 vaccine, following a CNN and \\u201cSesame Street\\u201d town hall on vaccines for kids, Cruz called the tweet \\u201cGovernment propaganda\\u2026for your 5 year old!\\u201d\", \"Leave aside the dubious claim that promoting childhood vaccination, a cornerstone of public health and schools, is \\u201cpropaganda.\\u201d Disregard how Cruz ignores that Big Bird was promoting the measles vaccine a half-century ago. (Cruz, after all, is the same cultural savant who once considered it a burn to label Democrats \\u201cthe party of Lisa Simpson.\\u201d) And forget that, for decades, liberal and conservative parents have loved \\u201cSesame Street\\u201d for its noncommercial wholesomeness.\", \"Cruz was at least on to one larger truth: \\u201cSesame Street\\u201d is political, and it has been from the beginning.\", \"It is political not in a partisan sense but because the way we teach and protect children \\u2014 and choose which children to teach and protect \\u2014 is inevitably bound up in politicized ideas.\", \"This, beyond the fond memories of Bert and Ernie and the Count, is the focus of the sweetly engaging documentary \\u201cStreet Gang: How We Got to Sesame Street,\\u201d directed by Marilyn Agrelo, which airs Monday on HBO. Drawing on the book \\u201cStreet Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street,\\u201d by Michael Davis, it uses file footage and new interviews to detail the early years of a puppet revolution.\", \"\\u201cSesame Street,\\u201d which premiered in 1969, was the project of Joan Ganz Cooney, a TV executive who was originally more interested in the civil rights movement than in education but came to see the connection between the two. \\u201cThe people who control the system read,\\u201d she once said, \\u201cand the people who make it in the system read.\\u201d And she believed that the best way to get the kids of the 1960s to read, paradoxically, was through TV.\", \"Her Children\\u2019s Television Workshop brought together educators and entertainers, including a puppeteer named Jim Henson and the director Jon Stone, an idealist attracted to Cooney\\u2019s idea of closing the literacy gap for inner-city Black children. \\u201cI think what drew Dad in really had to do with her political vision,\\u201d his daughter Kate Stone Lucas says in the documentary. (Stone died in 1997.)\", \"As \\u201cStreet Gang\\u201d lays out, the show\\u2019s very setting \\u2014 a city street, not a fantasy castle or picket-fenced house \\u2014 said something about the range of children it sought to welcome. The racially diverse cast of grown-ups and kids said something. \\u201cSesame Street\\u201d was open and public and real, as real as a block where humans hung out with furry monsters could be.\", \"\\u201cI saw it as a political show,\\u201d says Sonia Manzano, who played Maria, because of its casting and its determination to raise conversations that kids\\u2019 TV wasn\\u2019t used to having.\", \"Matt Robinson, the first actor to play Gordon, voiced the \\u201970s-era Muppet Roosevelt Franklin, who was created to represent Black children in the audience. The singer Buffy Sainte-Marie nursed a baby while explaining breastfeeding to Big Bird. The Rev. Jesse Jackson led kids in a call-and-response of \\u201cI am somebody!\\u201d\", \"Big Bird, whose character evolved early on from a goofy oaf to a curious child, has often been the young audience\\u2019s surrogate, just as he was when he offered up a wing to teach kids about the vaccine. The most memorable and moving example came when Will Lee, the actor who played the shopkeeper Mr. Hooper, died. The show wrote the death into an episode, in which Big Bird learned that when people die, they don\\u2019t come back.\", \"Out of the box, \\u201cSesame Street\\u201d was a rara avis: a mass-market hit on public TV, a kids\\u2019 show with sophistication and a wild countercultural energy. It even surprised the people who made it.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re shooting this show, and you see this ugly bird,\\u201d the cameraman Frank Biondo says in the documentary. \\u201cI remember thinking, \\u2018Who\\u2019s gonna watch this [expletive brought to you by the letter S]?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"But it was not universally loved. A Mississippi state TV commission refused to air \\u201cSesame Street\\u201d after complaints about the racially integrated cast. Local commercial affiliates picked up the show, knowing a hit when they saw one, and the board eventually reversed the vote.\", \"It\\u2019s easy today to feel superior to this racial history, or to forget it. When Sesame Street introduced a Korean American Muppet this year, Matt Schlapp, the president of the Conservative Political Action Committee, called the addition \\u201cinsane\\u201d on Twitter. \\u201cI grew up watching, and it was never about race,\\u201d he said on Fox News. (Someone inform Roosevelt Franklin.)\", \"\\u201cStreet Gang\\u201d cuts off around the end of the Jim Henson era (Henson died in 1990); Elmo gets just a fleeting glance, and decades of history, including the move of the flagship show to HBO, go unnoted. So the documentary doesn\\u2019t examine the show\\u2019s cast and format changes, or the question of whether it would or could have been created today, in an era of many more TV options for children (albeit more commercial ones).\", \"But as culture-war skirmishes like Cruz\\u2019s show, more has changed since \\u201cSesame Street\\u201d began than the number of TV outlets. The L.B.J.-Nixon era that gave us the show was polarized too, yet the series reflected at least some 20th-century consensus about the role of institutions, from government to medicine to TV networks. It was not outlandish that Washington would take a role in teaching kids through the country\\u2019s most popular mass medium. (Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, once an arch-conservative presidential nominee, was one of the most potent early defenders of \\u201cSesame Street.\\u201d)\", \"Now, in a time of fractured media and politics, characters from an HBO Max show do a CNN vaccination special that gets zapped on Twitter by a senator looking to score points with the Fox News audience. It\\u2019s a bigger media universe than when \\u201cSesame Street\\u201d first tried to cram the whole world into one block. But we live in smaller and smaller neighborhoods.\"]","href_hash":"52cb579a5b5611eca2074b1cd6e44d30"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"52cb579a5b5611eca2074b1cd6e44d30"}},
