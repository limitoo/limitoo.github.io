She could face up to 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine when she is sentenced on Feb. 14.\", \"Between 1977 and 2017, Ms. Thomas worked as a metallurgist at a steel foundry in Tacoma, Wash., owned by Atlas Castings & Technology and acquired by Bradken Inc., in 2008, according to the indictment in the case. Ms. Thomas was named director of metallurgy for the company in 2009.\", \"Bradken produces steel casings as a subcontractor or supplier for companies that contract with the Navy, according to the indictment. The company is the Navy\\u2019s leading supplier of \\u201ccast high-yield\\u201d steel used for naval submarines, prosecutors said, adding that the productions whose tests were falsified make up \\u201ca substantial percentage of the castings Bradken produced for the Navy.\\u201d It was not clear which submarines might have been affected.\", \"Around 1985 and through 2017, Ms. Thomas \\u201cknowingly devised and executed a scheme with the intent to defraud the United States Navy, and to obtain money and property by means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses and representations,\\u201d the indictment said.\", \"In an example of the \\u201cscheme to defraud,\\u201d the indictment said, Ms. Thomas would sometimes alter the first digit of the test results to increase weights by 10 or 20 foot-pounds on tests that determine the toughness of the steel and the \\u201camount of dynamic force\\u201d it can withstand.\", \"Ms. Thomas\\u2019s falsified test results \\u201ccaused the United States Navy to make contract payments that the Navy would not have made if it had known the true characteristics of the steel,\\u201d the indictment charged.\", \"In a statement filed in federal court on Monday by John Carpenter, a lawyer for Ms. Thomas, the former metallurgist said she \\u201ctook shortcuts and made material misrepresentations.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMs. Thomas never intended to compromise the integrity of any material and is gratified that the government\\u2019s testing does not suggest that the structural integrity of any submarine was in fact compromised,\\u201d the statement said. \\u201cThis offense is unique in that it was neither motivated by greed nor any desire for personal enrichment. She regrets that she failed to follow her moral compass \\u2014 admitting to false statements is hardly how she envisioned living out her retirement years.\\u201d\", \"Bradken\\u2019s leadership did not know about the falsified test results until May 2017, when a lab employee found out that the results had been \\u201caltered and that other discrepancies existed in Bradken\\u2019s record,\\u201d the U.S. attorney\\u2019s office said.\", \"Following the discovery of the falsified tests, Ms. Thomas agreed to voluntary interviews with federal agents in which she \\u201cmade false statements\\u201d to cover up that she had submitted hundreds of false results, according to the indictment.\", \"In 2019, Ms. Thomas acknowledged that she had changed some results, \\u201cbut stated that she must have had a good reason to change the results,\\u201d the indictment said.\", \"The company took responsibility for falsified tests in June 2020, and also paid more than $10.8 million in a civil settlement over the allegations that Bradken made and sold \\u201csubstandard steel components for installation on U.S. Navy submarines,\\u201d according to the U.S. attorney\\u2019s office.\", \"\\u201cThe Navy has taken extensive steps to ensure the safe operation of the affected submarines,\\u201d the U.S. attorney\\u2019s office said in the statement. \\u201cThose measures will result in increased costs and maintenance as the substandard parts are monitored.\\u201d\", \"Bradken and the Navy\\u2019s press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday night.\"]","href_hash":"02d40b7e411611ec96992589c8785334"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"02d40b7e411611ec96992589c8785334"}},
