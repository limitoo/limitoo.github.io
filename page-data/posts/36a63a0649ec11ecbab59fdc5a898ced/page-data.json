Now, the infrastructure bill sets aside federal funding to help neighborhoods like Trem\\u00e9.\", \"\\u201cFinally. Finally. Finally,\\u201d said Amy Stelly, co-founder of the Claiborne Avenue Alliance, a community organization working to dismantle the highway, which was singled out by President Biden this year. \\u201cWe have been talking about what to do with the highway for as long as I can remember.\\u201d\", \"But with just $1 billion \\u2014 5 percent of the $20 billion the Biden administration originally proposed \\u2014 allocated to reconnecting neighborhoods that suffered after highways divided them, it could be considerably longer before Ms. Stelly and other Trem\\u00e9 residents witness the removal of the Claiborne Expressway, which one early study estimated would cost more than $500 million.\", \"The infrastructure bill, signed by Mr. Biden on Monday, earmarks $250 million in planning grants and another $750 million in capital construction grants to reconnect neighborhoods bisected by highways. But that money is just a small fraction of what it would cost to address aging highways in New Orleans and dozens of other cities across America, from Tampa, Fla., to Rochester, N.Y.\", \"Today, more than three dozen citizen-led campaigns are underway, according to the Congress for the New Urbanism, all focused on grappling with the consequences of the highways that were carved through their communities.\", \"Removing or retrofitting any one of those highways \\u2014 which were built as a way to modernize regional transportation and meet the demands of postwar progress \\u2014 will be neither inexpensive nor quick.\", \"A plan to remove a section of Interstate 81 in Syracuse, N.Y., and rebuild a portion of Interstate 690 carries a price tag of at least $2 billion \\u2014 about twice the amount of funding approved by Congress for the entire country. The project to fill in a portion of the Inner Loop East highway in Rochester cost about $25 million.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s an important step, but a small step,\\u201d Ben Crowther, program manager for the C.N.U.\\u2019s Highways to Boulevards and Freeways Without Futures initiatives, said of the congressional funding. \\u201cI am looking at this as a down payment.\\u201d\", \"Some residents believe that urban highways, despite the disruptions they may have created when they were built, should remain. They cite the cost of removal or modification and the impact to traffic, particularly if there are no easy alternative routes.\", \"But the national conversation about the impact of highways in urban communities gained fresh traction as the country confronted its history of racism and racist policies after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd. Those campaigns took on new urgency as Mr. Biden made racial justice and climate change part of his domestic agenda.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s the recognition that driving these highways through the communities in the first place was wrong,\\u201d said Chris McCahill, managing director of State Smart Transportation Initiative, a transportation think tank based at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \\u201cAnd so now the question becomes, what to do about it now?\\u201d\", \"While Louisiana leaders could see about $6 billion from the larger $1.2 trillion package steered to the state\\u2019s aging roads and bridges, they said it was too early to know how much might go to New Orleans or whether removal of the Claiborne Expressway would even be among the top priorities.\", \"In New Orleans, city officials had not yet decided whether to pursue federal grants and were in the \\u201cearly stages of reviewing the legislation and the opportunities it creates,\\u201d said a city spokesman, Beau Tidwell.\", \"Still, Representative Troy Carter said he hoped the city might be a model in both removing the highway and in reinvesting in the neighborhood and protecting its \\u201cheritage.\\u201d In various scenarios that state and local leaders have explored, a number of ramps would be taken out or the highway itself would be removed from downtown, with traffic diverted around the area.\", \"\\u201cI would love to be able to restore that beautiful corridor to its original luster. But the devil\\u2019s in the details,\\u201d he said, adding that community input was critical to \\u201cmake sure we don\\u2019t swap one evil for another.\\u201d\", \"The highway\\u2019s age means it would need to be rebuilt if it were not torn down, said Shawn Wilson, secretary of the state\\u2019s Department of Transportation and Development. \\u201cSo that gives us an opportunity to re-envision what the corridor looks like, in terms of housing, green space and economic opportunity, and in terms of transit, safely connecting the neighborhood.\\u201d\", \"In Trem\\u00e9, century-old oak trees, towering and lush, once lined the wide median along North Claiborne Avenue. As far as the eye could see, they formed a protective green canopy above children playing after Sunday Mass, couples holding picnics and families celebrating the parades and pageantry of Mardi Gras.\", \"\\u201cIf you talk to anybody in Trem\\u00e9, they can tell you about the day the trees came down or when the highway was built,\\u201d said Lynette Boutte, a hair salon owner whose family\\u2019s roots in the neighborhood extend back generations. She wants to see the highway, nicknamed \\u201cthe bridge\\u201d or \\u201cthe monster\\u201d by residents, closed and retrofitted as a green space.\", \"In announcing the infrastructure plan this past spring, Mr. Biden acknowledged the damage that highway systems had done to some communities across the United States. He specifically pointed to Claiborne Avenue as an example of how transportation projects had severed neighborhoods and helped drive racial inequities.\", \"Claiborne Avenue, once referred to as the \\u201cMain Street\\u201d of Black New Orleans with more than 100 businesses, wilted under ill-fated urban renewal policies. Only a few dozen businesses stand today.\", \"Formally named Faubourg Trem\\u00e9, the neighborhood is imbued with a rich cultural and musical history. Dating back to the early 19th century, the neighborhood was racially diverse, made up of free people of color, enslaved African Americans and Caribbean and European immigrants. Claiborne Avenue was both walkable and affordable, what Richard Campanella, a geographer at Tulane, called \\u201curbanism at its best.\\u201d\", \"For a long time, the avenue was bustling with work and play. It was lined with insurance businesses, hardware stores, pharmacies and tailors, along with jazz halls and social clubs. Much of that changed with the highway project, which was pitched as an efficient way to shuffle cars downtown and keep it thriving. About 500 homes were cleared to make room, according to C.N.U., a disruption that led shops to shutter and property values to fall.\", \"Advocates for the highway\\u2019s removal contend that the stretch of Interstate 10 should never have been built through such a vibrant neighborhood, and that race played a role. They point, too, to an elevated highway that was slated to run along the edge of the famous French Quarter. That plan was stopped by preservationists in the late 1960s while the Claiborne project proceeded.\", \"\\u201cHere is this neighborhood rich with so much history and contributions to music and culture,\\u201d said Raynard Sanders, executive director of the Claiborne Avenue History Project. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s also a place that has felt like it was attacked over and over.\\u201d\", \"With about 4,600 residents, Trem\\u00e9 is still an intimate, mostly working-class neighborhood with enduring ties to its history and culture, where people can spend an afternoon talking about Mardi Gras and jazz \\u2014 and just as passionately trace their roots back to that first relative who moved into the neighborhood a century ago.\", \"Some Trem\\u00e9 residents, already fighting for civil rights, objected to the Claiborne Expressway when it was first proposed. But they were not heard.\", \"\\u201cThey didn\\u2019t have the political clout, the get-your-representative-on-the-phone political access to stop it,\\u201d said Mr. Campanella, a geographer at the Tulane University School of Architecture who has written several books about the history, culture and geography of New Orleans. \\u201cSome people didn\\u2019t even realize it was happening until the backhoes showed up.\\u201d\", \"Barbara Briscoe remembers the day in February 1966 when the soaring oak trees, under which she played with friends and rode her bike, were suddenly uprooted. \\u201cIt was devastating,\\u201d Ms. Briscoe, now 80 years old, said. \\u201cCan you imagine growing up around all those beautiful trees, and then they were gone? Claiborne was never the same after that.\\u201d\", \"Over the years, neighbors said the highway settled in as a kind of unwanted and loud neighbor. It spewed thunderous roars and thick grime, and its entrance and exit ramps facilitated all manner of crime. But something else happened, too: a new culture, one with its own traditions, developed beneath the highway.\", \"It is not uncommon to see funerals spill from the doors of nearby churches, with mourners and brass bands marching along Claiborne, the spirited notes from the trombones and trumpets rising above the rumbling of trucks overhead. On weekends, the grounds are often full with music, dancing and vendors selling cups of fruit.\", \"Some fear that a complete removal of the highway will further destroy the neighborhood \\u2014 or usher in a wave of gentrification that would push out longtime residents who directly experienced the highway\\u2019s ills. Others believe that the money might be better spent on other priorities in the neighborhood.\", \"\\u201cWith the size of the ramps, how can you move all that concrete without tearing the neighborhood up even more? When it was built it was disruptive,\\u201d Ms. Boutte said. \\u201cI do not like it, but I am not sure you can take it down without causing even more damage. We might just have to live with it.\\u201d\", \"But there also remain those like Ms. Stelly, who has longed since childhood to see the highway completely gone and Claiborne Avenue restored to its former glory. As an architectural designer, she believes that the highway \\u2014 about a block from the home where four generations of her family have lived \\u2014 crushed much of Trem\\u00e9\\u2019s promise.\", \"\\u201cI was just a kid,\\u201d she said, \\u201cbut I knew that monstrosity should not have been in the middle of our neighborhood. It is a monument to racism.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"36a63a0649ec11ecbab59fdc5a898ced"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"36a63a0649ec11ecbab59fdc5a898ced"}},
