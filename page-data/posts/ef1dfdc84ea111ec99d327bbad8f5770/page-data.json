Between three of us, we owned five typewriters and no social media accounts. There we were in the metaverse, longing for the one thing it can\\u2019t provide: the experience of touch.\", \"Through virtual and augmented reality (also Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses), Meta\\u2019s technology aims to change how we live, how we connect with friends and family (imagine teleporting hologram-you to concerts or Thanksgiving dinners). Except for all its patter about bringing people together, Meta advances a fundamental human disconnection: It removes our bodies from the equation.\", \"I, for one, will not go gentle into the metaverse. Not because I\\u2019m anti-technology (I\\u2019m not) or unreasonably attached to the pleasures of gel ink pens and hard-bound books (I may be). It\\u2019s because after struggling with anorexia and bulimia for more than 20 years, the last thing I want is technology that further estranges me from my body. \\u201cIf we lose touch with ourselves,\\u201d the philosopher Richard Kearney writes, \\u201cwe lose touch with the world. No tactile connection, no resonance between self and other.\\u201d\", \"Months of lockdowns, Zoom cocktails and elbow dabs have left us in a touch crisis. Books like Mr. Kearney\\u2019s \\u201cTouch: Recovering Our Most Vital Sense\\u201d and Sushma Subramanian\\u2019s \\u201cHow to Feel: The Science and Meaning of Touch,\\u201d both published this year, deal directly with this basic need. We\\u2019ve even developed a language that likens touch to basic sustenance and survival: Articles about \\u201ctouch hunger\\u201d and \\u201ctouch starvation\\u201d reveal just how vital this tactile connection is. Touch is central to our humanity, the first sense we develop.\", \"Virtual world-builders know this, too, and are increasingly confronting the need for touch and developing new ways to recreate it. There\\u2019s Steve Yonahan\\u2019s Haptic Creature \\u2014 a zoomorphic, robotic slothy thing that purrs and vibrates, influencing the emotional states of humans who pet and hold it. Texas A&M researchers are developing touch screens with \\u201cmaximum haptic effect\\u201d to transmit textures (you\\u2019ll feel the difference between sateen and percale sheets online, they claim). Researchers at Johns Hopkins found incorporating haptic feedback into prosthetic upper limbs has made them easier for amputees to use.\", \"Tiffany Field, the director of the Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami, has been studying touch for more than four decades. Her research reveals the importance of touch from the earliest stages of human life. Pregnancy massage reduces low birth weight (as well as postpartum depression). Massaging the limbs of preterm infants with moderate pressure leads them to gain weight 47 percent faster. Touch produces oxytocin, the \\u201ccuddle hormone\\u201d that bonds parents to their newborns during \\u201cskin-to-skin time.\\u201d Touch improves attentiveness and quantitative performance (speed and accuracy on math problems). In adolescent mothers experiencing depression, massage decreases anxious behaviors. In patients with H.I.V., massage therapy leads to an increase in natural killer cells. Anorexia, autism, backaches, cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis and PTSD all respond to touch.\", \"Even victims of sexual abuse benefit from therapeutic touch. After a month of twice-weekly massages, women studied by the Touch Research Institute experienced less depression and anxiety, and their cortisol levels had dropped. Women in the no-massage control group \\u201creported an increasingly negative attitude toward touch.\\u201d\", \"Reading about the work of Liisa Holsti, a neonatal pain researcher, and Karon MacLean, a haptics researcher, I was surprised how moved I could be learning about haptic technology. Their 2020 study introduced the Calmer, a rectangular incubator insert fitted with pneumatic bellows, subwoofers and a microcontroller that replicates a mother\\u2019s breathing rate, heartbeat and touch for preterm babies in the NICU. \\u201cSkin-to-skin time,\\u201d or \\u201cKangaroo care,\\u201d when the baby is laid belly-down on the parent\\u2019s chest after birth, lessens newborn pain. If a parent can\\u2019t be present or a nurse is unavailable to comfort the baby during a routine procedure, such as a blood draw, the Calmer offers an alternative to human touch interaction, what a mother who participated in the study described as \\u201ca backup me.\\u201d\", \"I was admittedly anti-touch for most of my life. (I\\u2019ve known other people with eating disorders who are, too; my equally anti-touch best friend and I would joke about the jangly awkwardness of our Christmas hug.) That changed when I had a baby and I discovered how the six-pound weight of my son on my chest felt like the heaviest love in the world. No wonder engineering the first sense is so important.\", \"And while the expansion of the metaverse may incentivize teams like Facebook AI to develop further somatosensory simulations, I am skeptical of the values that will guide their work. Will they be as ethical as Dr. Holsti and Dr. MacLean, who took 10 years to trial three prototypes of a haptic designed to \\u201creplicate not replace\\u201d the maternal presence? Will Mr. Zuckerberg\\u2019s company be as sensitive to users\\u2019 feelings of disconnection or disembodiment when supplying them with sensory technologies like ReSkin, with its \\u201cscalable and inexpensive tactile-sensation modules\\u201d?\", \"Meta signals Mr. Zuckerberg\\u2019s investment in the \\u201cembodied internet,\\u201d but it is ultimately a technology that keeps us apart, making us ever more alienated from our bodies and one another. Being disconnected from my body fed the self-hatred and perfectionism that facilitated my eating disorder. We don\\u2019t need to swap out our bodies with holographs and avatars. We need to nurture our sense of touch. A firm hand squeeze during grace, a cuddle with the dog on the couch, a hug like you mean it. In other words, the tactile joys of being alive.\"]","href_hash":"ef1dfdc84ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ef1dfdc84ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}},
