But in this era \\u2014 and this economy \\u2014 Mark (Ben Rosenfield), a dog walker/aspiring inventor, and Mary (Hayley Law), a naughty maid/aspiring singer, are a freak show to their single friends who razz the pair for buying into institutionalized monogamy.\", \"Marriage is, like, totally lame and repressive, goes the argument, no matter how many mushrooms the kooky couple gobbled on their honeymoon. And so the peer-pressured Mark and Mary open their bedroom to some other people \\u2014 lots of other people \\u2014 to prove they can be married and modern.\", \"Marks, just 28 herself, is a sharp and funny observer of today\\u2019s youth paradox: How can her generation build stability on a foundation of temp jobs, shifting social mores and the suspicion that the entire planet might collapse before they cash in their 401(k)s? (Related: Why bother growing up at all?)\", \"These doubts lurk in the shadows of this candy-tinted charmer. Mostly, the director spotlights how the easily bruised Mark and the recklessly confident Mary are too immature to commit to their own commitment \\u2014 and too broke for therapy. The editor Andy Holton notes the forced laughs, the anxious tequila shots, the cookies stress-eaten in the pillaged marriage bed, all over a soundtrack of swoony pop. It\\u2019s clear these overgrown kids are careening toward adult-size pain. But Marks\\u2019s infatuation with her flawed lovebirds also seduces the audience. If Mark and Mary could see their chemistry through the camera\\u2019s lens, they\\u2019d embrace becoming old, gray and hopelessly pass\\u00e9.\"]","href_hash":"621653523d6111ec8344000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"621653523d6111ec8344000017025a03"}},
