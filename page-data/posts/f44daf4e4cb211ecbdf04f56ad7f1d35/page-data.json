They were convicted in 2018.\", \"Jara, a popular musician and university professor, was targeted for being an ardent supporter of Marxist President Salvador Allende. On September 11, 1973, Allende's government was overthrown by a military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet. Jara was taken only hours after Pinochet took power.\", \"The singer, along with about 5,000 other Allende supporters, was brought to a sports stadium in Santiago that was being used as a detention center.\", \"According to the BBC, Jara wrote his final song, \\\"Estadio Chile,\\\" in that stadium, where he was tortured. He wrote the lyrics \\\"How hard it is to sing when I must sing of horror/ Horror which I am living, horror which I am dying.\\\"\", \"Two hours later, he was fatally shot, his body riddled with at least 44 machine-gun bullets.\", \"The appeals court said the original judges had mistakenly classified the crime as less serious than it was, leading them to make up for it by lengthening the sentences.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939076/victor-jara-chile.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A Court of Appeals in Chile increased from 18 to 25 years the prison sentences of six of the seven former soldiers who tortured and murdered well-known folk singer Victor Jara, who was arrested and shot after the military coup of 1973.
