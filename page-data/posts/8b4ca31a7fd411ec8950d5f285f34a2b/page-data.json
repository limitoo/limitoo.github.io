Approximately 40,000 soldiers and 1,200 armored vehicles entered into Georgia\\u2019s semi-autonomous region of South Ossetia before stopping about 35 miles short of Tbilisi, Georgia\\u2019s capital.\", \"Putin attempted to justify the invasion under the pretense of the international norm of the responsibility to protect. In this case, Russia argued that its use of force was required to protect Osseitians from Georgian \\u201cgenocide\\u201d.\", \"Yet the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, a nongovernmental international agency started in 2008 to prevent genocide, found no legal justification for Russia\\u2019s use of force. Instead, there is plenty of evidence to indicate the war was \\u201cpremeditated.\\u201d\", \"In 2014, when Russian invaded Crimea, Putin had a large troop formation along Ukraine\\u2019s border. But instead of invading there, Putin used hybrid warfare to seize Crimea, a peninsula that juts into the Black Sea and housed a Russian naval base.\", \"Ukraine failed to provide a military response. But when Russia actively supported separatists in the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk \\u2013 collectively known as the Donbass \\u2013 Ukraine fought back. Even though Ukraine\\u2019s military was in a \\u201cdecrepit\\u201d state, hollowed out by decades of corruption, it was able to push the Russian-backed separatists to the border with the help of volunteers.\", \"In response, Russia increased its support, sending small military formations to assist the separatists.\", \"In 2014, Russia forcibly annexed Crimea, previously a part of Ukraine that is also home to a major Russian Navy base. The Donbass region of eastern Ukraine has also been an area of fighting between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces.\", \"As a career U.S. special forces officer with combat and operational deployments in Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, Africa and South America, I conducted field research on the 2008 and 2014 wars in Georgia and Ukraine. Based on my military experience, Putin would not want to send large troop formations into Ukraine without some sort of justification, credible or not. As it is now, justification for an invasion would be extremely difficult for Putin. That doesn\\u2019t mean he won\\u2019t invade anyway.\", \"From what I have learned, I expect a possible Russian invasion would start with cyberattacks and electronic warfare to sever communications between Ukraine\\u2019s capital and the troops. Shortly thereafter, tanks and mechanized infantry formations supported by the Russian air force would cross at multiple points along the nearly 1,200-mile border, assisted by Russian special forces. Russia would seek to bypass large urban areas.\", \"Likewise, Ukraine would seek to keep the major combat out of large urban areas to minimize the destruction. But neither side likely would be able to avoid urban fighting altogether.\", \"It would likely be a limited incursion. The political cost of capturing Ukraine\\u2019s capital would be too high, and as a result, Putin would likely stop short of Kiev, just as he did with Tbilisi during the invasion of Georgia in 2014. But the war would be extremely costly for Russia because of significant improvements in the Ukrainian military since 2014.\", \"In 2008, a less sophisticated Georgian Army shot down as many as 22 Russian aircraft, causing Russia to significantly decrease its sorties. Russia would likely meet the same fate in 2022 against a Ukrainian military armed with Stinger missiles that are being transferred from Lithuania and Latvia.\", \"After testing Ukrainian air defenses and suffering losses in the first few days, I suspect Russia would largely ground its aircraft and instead rely on multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to knock out strategic strongholds.\", \"Ukraine also would likely keep its air force grounded, just as it did in 2014, leading observers to question why Ukraine maintains an air force that costs billions of dollars if it fails to employ it in war.\", \"On the ground, Russian tanks also would likely face a much different defense. In 2014, for instance, Russian T-90 tanks supporting separatists in Ukraine\\u2019s Donbass region were almost impenetrable. Since then, Ukraine has upgraded its defense. In 2017, the United States provided Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, with additional missiles arriving from Estonia in the coming days. These man-portable, self-guided missiles are extremely accurate, extremely effective, easy to use and would inflict heavy losses on the Russians.\", \"Ukraine\\u2019s military is far more capable now than it was in 2014. Since then, the United States has committed over $2.7 billion in training and equipment that has helped reform Ukraine\\u2019s defenses. Ukraine\\u2019s military is now at least on par and most likely better than the Russians at the tactical level, which is similar to 2008 when Georgian forces often outperformed their Russian counterparts.\", \"When Russia invaded the Donbass, Ukrainian \\u201cvolunteers\\u201d flocked east to stave off Russian forces, preventing Ukraine from losing more than just the Donbass. Many were completely untrained, yet they fought well. Over the past few years, volunteers have continued to train.\", \"Russia would not have the element of surprise as it did in 2008 and 2014. Instead, it would find a ready and trained volunteer force that would provide not only critical intelligence to the Ukrainian military but also counterattacks against Russian forces during the invasion.\", \"Despite the advances of the Ukrainian military, Russia\\u2019s military, due to its sheer size, would still overwhelm the Ukrainians.\", \"Yet a military victory would come at an extremely high military and political cost. Sanctions against Russia following its seizure of Crimea in 2014 have been estimated to have reduced Russia\\u2019s economic growth by 2.5 to 3%, or roughly $50 billion per year. Sanctions would likely be much more significant this time.\", \"It is doubtful that Putin is willing to accept these costs. With additional Javelin and Stinger missiles being sent to Ukraine from Western allies and messaging from President Joe Biden that Russia would \\u201cpay a heavy price\\u201d for any invasion, Putin might heed the warnings.\", \"Liam Collins is a founding director at the Modern War Institute in the United States Military Academy West Point.\"]","href_hash":"8b4ca31a7fd411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8b4ca31a7fd411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
