Would it make the dish brighter, fuller, tastier? To me, this tweaking is part of the fun, one of the main reasons I love to cook.\", \"And so it went recently when I set out to make some coconut oil roasted sweet potatoes, a recipe I developed in 2011, and still regularly riff on.\", \"Over the past decade, I\\u2019ve switched up the spices, added other vegetables, layered on sauces, proteins and herbs. As long as I didn\\u2019t mess with the bones of the recipe \\u2014 the coconut oil, the sweet potatoes, the roasting temperature \\u2014 I really couldn\\u2019t go wrong. The sweet potatoes would always end up richly flavored and delicately crisp on the outside, velvety within.\", \"That is, as long as I didn\\u2019t take the sweet potatoes out of the oven early.\", \"As Steven D., a reader, wrote in the notes of the original recipe online at New York Times Cooking, \\u201cThe potatoes are soft after a half-hour or so, but then the crusts harden in the second half-hour, giving them the delicious texture that makes the dish unique.\\u201d\", \"The last time I made this dish, I wanted to serve it as a main course rather than as a side. So I took the well-trodden path of putting an egg on top \\u2014 in this case, fried in coconut oil until the edges ruffled and crisped, turning brittle and brown.\", \"Of course, thinking about fried eggs made me crave a side of bacon. But since I wanted to go meatless, I approximated bacon\\u2019s brawniness with a dash of smoked paprika. It added complexity to the potatoes and gave a jolt of color to the eggs right at the end, the deep red powder streaking orange in the yolks.\", \"I also added chopped salted almonds for crunch, and a creamy, garlicky yogurt sauce to bring together the elements. It made for a wonderfully cozy, satisfying meal that I\\u2019ll probably never make again.\", \"But you can make it as often as you like, tweaked to your heart\\u2019s content.\", \"Recipe: Smoky Sweet Potatoes With Eggs and Almonds\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
