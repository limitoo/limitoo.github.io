He said the cases were linked and related to travel from southern Africa. \", \"Javid said the two confirmed cases are self-isolating alongside their households while contact tracing and targeted testing takes place.\\u00a0\", \"He also added four more countries \\u2014 Angola, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia \\u2014 onto the country's travel red list from Sunday. Six others \\u2014 Botswana, Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland), Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe \\u2014 were added Friday. That means anyone permitted to arrive from those destinations will have to quarantine. \", \"\\\"This is a real reminder that this pandemic is far from over,\\\" he said. \\\"If we need to take further action, we will.\\\" \", \"Prime Minister Boris Johnson, along with his top advisers, will be holding a media briefing later Saturday.\", \"Many countries have slapped restrictions on various southern African countries over the past couple of days including Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Iran, Japan, Thailand and the United States, in response to warnings over the transmissibility of the new variant \\u2014 against the advice of the World Health Organization. Pharmaceutical companies expressed optimism that they could finesse their vaccines to deal with the new variant though that would clearly take some time. \", \"Despite the banning of flights, there are mounting concerns that the variant has already been widely seeded around the world. In addition to the U.K., cases have been reported in travelers in Belgium, Israel and Hong Kong. Germany also said it suspected a positive case and Dutch authorities were testing whether 61 people who arrived on two flights from South Africa with COVID-19 have the Omicron variant.\", \"The global health body has named the new variant Omicron, labeling it a variant of concern because of its high number of mutations and some early evidence that it carries a higher degree of infection than other variants. That means people who contracted COVID-19 and recovered could be subject to catching it again. It could take weeks to know if current vaccines are less effective against it.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"3912bd964f9b11ec958901b182828e8a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3912bd964f9b11ec958901b182828e8a"}},
