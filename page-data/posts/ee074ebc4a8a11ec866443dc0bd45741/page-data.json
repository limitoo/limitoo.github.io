(Three Dartmouth senior defensive starters missed their career finale Saturday after testing positive for the virus earlier this week.)\", \"\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t know what we had coming into this season, but we had the same expectation,\\u201d Dartmouth linebacker Tanner Cross said. He and two other senior captains, quarterback Derek Kyler and tight end Robbie Mangas, held aloft the Ivy League championship trophy, which Dartmouth shared with Yale in 2019.\", \"If the Ohio States of the world settled for playing a truncated schedule last season, or if the Stanfords did not play in front of fans or the Delawares had to wait until the spring, at least they played some version of football.\", \"The Ivy League, instead, took a redshirt year.\", \"Without the lure of billions in television revenue or the prodding of an overwhelming number of fans demanding their football fix, the Ivy League presidents decided on July 8, 2020, that they would not play football last fall \\u2014 and, later, that they would only allow a handful of sports competition in the spring.\", \"Most football players, with weight rooms shuttered just like classrooms, remained at home or retreated far from campus last fall. Some seniors did not enroll for a term so they could retain their eligibility; the Ivy League, which does not allow graduate students to play sports, made an exception for this season in February, but it was too late for many to apply. And when two classes of freshmen football players arrived on campuses in August, many were meeting their coaches \\u2014 and their teammates \\u2014 for the first time.\", \"The Dartmouth strength coach Spencer Brown tried to engage players during the pandemic, soliciting videos for creative workouts they were doing on their own. (Punter/kicker Ryan Bloch built weight lifting equipment from PVC pipe and buckets filled with rocks and water.) But with more than 120 players on the roster, there was so much learning to do. When the freshmen offensive linemen were required during training camp to state the names of the starting defensive line, one earnest freshman referred to Shane Cokes, a junior defensive end, as Shawn Coates. Among his teammates, the new name has stuck \\u2014 even as Cokes has had a standout season.\", \"\\u201cThe only contact we could have for the better part of the year was virtual and they were all isolated,\\u201d Dartmouth Coach Buddy Teevens said. \\u201cNormally you have a couple team meetings where you\\u2019re talking about table manners or public speaking or social issues. With little screenshots, it was just different \\u2014 there\\u2019s no engagement. Once guys click off, they\\u2019re back in their individual world. Nobody had a chance to interact.\\u201d\", \"The first practice looked like Football 101. The first game was not much better: Dartmouth fumbled five times and gave up two safeties, though the Big Green managed to still beat Valparaiso. Dartmouth (9-1 overall; 6-1 in conference) would wallop Princeton, 31-7, but settled for sharing the title with the Tigers (9-1, 6-1) after losing to Columbia, 19-0.\", \"There was much learning to do at Princeton as well.\", \"In the spring of 2020, as scientists were just beginning to learn about the new virus, Princeton Coach Bob Surace and the then-athletic director Mollie Marcoux Samaan developed a 40-page blueprint detailing how football could be played safely. It included setting up an outdoor weight room, staggering where receivers would line up when they ran routes in practice and not retreating to locker rooms during halftime.\", \"Though vaccines are now available \\u2014 everyone in the program is vaccinated, Surace said \\u2014 protective measures remain.\", \"The defensive staff is in the football offices, but the offensive coaches have set up shop in the stadium. When Surace meets with his coordinators to go over game plans, it is outdoors or over the phone. All post-practice meetings are outdoors. Instead of the entire offense or defense meeting as a group, players have met by position group and are spread out \\u2014 20 offensive linemen in a 60-seat classroom, for example.\", \"The Tigers have also not been immune from the rest of the world\\u2019s supply chain chaos. Helmets had to be borrowed from other colleges during training camp because of delays in getting equipment to pass inspection after being reconditioned. (Trevor Forbes, a senior defensive back, practiced in a borrowed red helmet until the week of the season opener.) There were also days when recovery drinks were gulped down without ice because nearby convenience stores were out.\", \"\\u201cOur players were so patient with things they weren\\u2019t accustomed to that were out of our control,\\u201d said Surace, whose team lost only to Dartmouth. \\u201cAppreciating being out there overrode everything.\\u201d\", \"Few in the Ivy League this season have been more appreciative than the fifth-year seniors who put off graduation in order to have a chance to play their final season. \\u201cIt was the best decision of my life,\\u201d said Forbes, one of 17 Princeton seniors who deferred their studies to remain eligible. A sociology major, he was hired by a media tech company and spent the year living and working in Dallas. He added: \\u201cI gained some real world skills and then I got to come back and play this game that I love with my boys \\u2014 and get some closure.\\u201d\", \"Nick Howard, a quarterback at Dartmouth, had a different appreciation. He spent the early part of this year tending to his mother, who died of cancer in April. \\u201cAs horrible as it was being locked down, in a way I\\u2019m thankful,\\u201d said Howard, a junior from Green Bay, Wis. \\u201cI\\u2019m an only child, and for me being home helped me appreciate what you have when you have it. Like a family meal with people you care about or being in a locker room with your friends.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cI learned more than anything how important this team is to me. I love my teammates.\\u201d\", \"Even as football has resumed far closer to normal this season, with almost no interruptions and with fans in attendance, a reminder of how little has been guaranteed arrived here Saturday when Dartmouth players emptied the bus on a sunny, crisp 40-degree morning. Among those not traveling with the team were middle linebacker Jalen Mackie, safety Niko Mermigas and linebacker Trevon Erickson. Also out was receiver Isaac Boston. All had tested positive for the coronavirus this week, according to Teevens, the first positives Dartmouth had all season.\", \"\\u201cIt felt like the cards got flipped on us,\\u201d said Cross, a fifth-year senior from Fort Smith, Ark., who gave his team a pep talk Friday before they boarded buses here. \\u201cWe weren\\u2019t sure how many we were going to be without, but we were going to show up with what we had. That\\u2019s the beautiful thing about our program.\\u201d\", \"The defense, which hadn\\u2019t allowed more than 21 points all season, did not play to its standards against E.J. Perry, a former Boston College quarterback. But the patchwork unit nevertheless stuffed Brown running back Allen Smith on fourth-and-1 at the Brown 34 with the score tied at 14-14 in the second quarter. A few plays later, Jonny Barrett, a Dartmouth reserve receiver, made a superb, leaping catch in the end zone on one of Kyler\\u2019s three touchdown passes.\", \"The offense continued to shoulder the load. Howard, the other part of Dartmouth\\u2019s quarterback tandem, rushed for two touchdowns, giving him 15 on the season. And capping Dartmouth\\u2019s scoring was Keegan McHugh, a senior reserve running back who bolted 65 yards for a touchdown that elicited an enormous celebration along the visiting sideline.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m just so happy for these guys,\\u201d Teevens said, as players and their families celebrated around him. \\u201cThere was so much uncertainty \\u2014 the fifth-year seniors who put their lives on hold and said I\\u2019m coming back, the younger guys that hadn\\u2019t played in a while, the recruits who came in without visiting campus. We were kind of a no-name group and look at where they are now.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ee074ebc4a8a11ec866443dc0bd45741"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ee074ebc4a8a11ec866443dc0bd45741"}},
