It mutated mid-production when Hopper, cast as the girl\\u2019s father, became the director and, scarcely less violently than his character, threw caution to the wind.\", \"The movie, which looks great in a new 4K restoration, is at Metrograph in Manhattan through Nov. 28.\", \"Set amid the impressive vistas of the Canadian northwest, \\u201cOut of the Blue\\u201d is a boldly feel-bad film about punk rock, lunatic driving and deranged family values. A disgraced trucker, Don (Hopper) returns home after five years in prison to find work in the town dump. Meanwhile, his malleable wife, Kathy (the veteran TV actor Sharon Farrell), shoots up in the bathroom and their Elvis-obsessed daughter, the hard-faced urchin Cebe (Linda Manz, fresh from her attention-grabbing turn in Terrence Malik\\u2019s \\u201cDays of Heaven\\u201d), plots to escape high school.\", \"Cebe has already run away to Vancouver for a short-lived idyll involving an Elvis impersonator; a degenerate cabdriver; a house of sin; a rowdy punk performance in which she got to play drums; a stolen car; and a session with a stern social worker, played by the Canadian actor Raymond Burr whose fleeting presence sealed the project\\u2019s status as a Canadian tax-shelter production. \", \"\\u201cOut of the Blue\\u201d takes its title and several songs from Neil Young and Crazy Horse\\u2019s 1979 LP, \\u201cRust Never Sleeps.\\u201d It\\u2019s a pop culture assemblage not unlike Cebe\\u2019s boudoir which, in addition to an Elvis shrine and several punk rock posters, contains a teddy bear, a model truck, a car-top flashing light, various road signs, a decapitated Barbie and a framed picture of a pink poodle.\", \"Many scenes have a semi-improvised feel. Hopper, who gives himself some spectacularly self-indulgent moments, is often riveting, but the movie ultimately belongs to Manz, introduced in Halloween clown-face makeup happily riding in Daddy\\u2019s rig. \\u201cAm I as sexy as Elvis?\\u201d Hopper demands, eyes off the road, heading for a particularly horrendous collision with destiny.\", \"\\u201cThis father and daughter may not resemble any other father and daughter you\\u2019ve ever seen,\\u201d Janet Maslin wrote in her appreciative New York Times review, adding that \\u201cwhatever wavelength Mr. Hopper is on here, she\\u2019s on it, too.\\u201d Indeed, unfazed by the antics of her director-father, Manz doesn\\u2019t appear to be acting.\", \"At one point, Cebe goes with friends to a movie that, less than likely, is Chaplin\\u2019s \\u201cModern Times.\\u201d \\u201cI hate happy endings,\\u201d she announces. It\\u2019s a foregone conclusion that \\u201cOut of the Blue\\u201d won\\u2019t have one, but Hopper uncorks a closer far beyond mere unhappiness.\", \"Reviewing the movie for The Village Voice, I observed that \\u201cOut of the Blue\\u201d is just that: \\u201cYou rarely know what will happen next and you scarcely believe it when it does.\\u201d That still holds true.\"]","href_hash":"b621f58147f911ec914c4b12a27dd40d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b621f58147f911ec914c4b12a27dd40d"}},
