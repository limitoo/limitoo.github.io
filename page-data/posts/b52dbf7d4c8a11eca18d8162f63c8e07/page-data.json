tonight.\", \"The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) is set to begin its 10-month journey to nudge a space rock out of its orbit.\", \"It will be the first time NASA has attempted a\\u00a0trial of\\u00a0what they call the \\\"kinetic impact\\\" technique \\u2014\\u00a0aka smashing a spacecraft into a space rock \\u2014\\u00a0as a planetary defence strategy.\", \"\\\"We're trying to make sure that a rock from space doesn't send us back to the Stone Age,\\\"\\u00a0said Thomas Statler, from\\u00a0NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office.\", \"\\\"Even though it's unlikely that an asteroid will hit us during our lifetimes, it's one of those things that can happen.\", \"\\\"If we're ever in a situation where we need to ... defend the Earth, we will want to know by how much\\u00a0a real kinetic impactor moves a real asteroid.\\\"\", \"Although this might\\u00a0sound\\u00a0like a flashback from the 1998 movie Armageddon, there are some key differences.\", \"The lead character isn't played by Bruce Willis but\\u00a0a $US313.8 million ($431\\u00a0million) spacecraft; the rock isn't the size of Texas;\\u00a0and there are no plans to blast it apart with a nuclear bomb.\", \"Here's what's going to happen in the real scenario.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What is the spacecraft going to crash into?</div>\", \"The spacecraft will be heading out to an asteroid called Didymos, which sits in the\\u00a0main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter about\\u00a011 million kilometres away from us.\", \"Didymos is orbited by a smaller asteroid\\u00a0called Dimorphos, which is about 160 metres in diameter.\\u00a0\", \"Dimorphos is\\u00a0the smallest thing NASA has ever attempted to hit,\\u00a0says\\u00a0DART mission lead\\u00a0Alan Cheng of Johns Hopkins University\\u00a0Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland.\", \"\\\"It's half the height of the Eiffel Tower,\\\"\\u00a0says Dr Cheng, who first proposed the mission to NASA.\", \"\\\"There are\\u00a0buildings that are bigger than this asteroid.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e6feba90e284030a30d212d9e75f06ff\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The diameter of the asteroids compared with the height of buildings and length of DART spacecraft\\u00a0to scale.(ABC: Modified from NASA/Johns Hopkins APL)</div>\", \"But an asteroid of this size\\u00a0could still pack a punch if\\u00a0it\\u00a0hit us.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's the kind of asteroid that you would want to deflect if you ever discovered one heading toward the Earth, because [an asteroid this size]\\u00a0would destroy the whole area around a city,\\\" Dr Cheng says.\", \"Luckily,\\u00a0 Dimorphos will never hit the Earth, which is one of the reasons why it was chosen.\", \"It was also chosen because changes to its orbit can be observed from Earth-bound telescopes\\u00a0as it passes in front of its companion\\u00a0Didymos, causing dips in light.\", \"\\\"If you did this at a single asteroid, you would actually need a second spacecraft [to measure changes],\\\" Dr Cheng says.\", \"The final reason is that it comes unusually close to us in 2022.\", \"That will not only make it cheaper\\u00a0to get to, but brighter to look at through telescopes on Earth.\", \"\\\"We don't even know of another asteroid system that meets all those criteria,\\\" Dr Cheng says.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What's the plan?</div>\", \"The first opportunity to launch the spacecraft will be\\u00a0about 5:20pm (AEDT) today.\", \"After the golf-cart sized spacecraft launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base in\\u00a0California, it will spread its 9-metre solar panel wings and spend the next 10 months flying towards its target.\", \"<img

an asteroid out of its orbit</div>\", \"As it homes in on the rocks in September or October next year, it will use its onboard camera to get a better idea of the size and shape of both Didymos and Dimorphos.\", \"About four hours before impact it will lock in its navigation system and then plummet towards\\u00a0Dimorphos\\u00a0at about 6 kilometres per second.\", \"\\\"It needs to autonomously figure out how to hit the asteroid and make the course corrections very late, just minutes before impact.\\\"\", \"At the same time, it will send back high-resolution images of the projected crash site right up to the point of its fiery death.\", \"The crash will also be captured by a briefcase-sized satellite known as LICIACube, which will be\\u00a0trailing the spacecraft.\", \"Released by the spacecraft about two days before impact, the Italian-made satellite will fly past the crash as it happens, taking images of how much stuff is blown off the asteroid.\", \"\\\"The DART impact happens at several times the speed of a rifle bullet,\\\" Dr Cheng says.\", \"\\u00a0\\\"That impact will blast many tonnes of material off the asteroid.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What are we trying to find out?</div>\", \"The\\u00a0 \\\"kinetic impact technique\\\" \\u2014\\u00a0aka smashing into something at high speed \\u2014\\u00a0will give scientists an idea about how hard they have to hit

Infographic showing the effect of DART's impact on the orbit of Didymos B.(Supplied:\\u00a0\\u00a0NASA/Johns Hopkins APL)</div>\", \"One of the big unknowns is how much energy is transferred into the asteroid, not\\u00a0just by the spacecraft, but by the stuff that is blown off.\", \"\\\"As\\u00a0you make a crater it acts like a little rocket engine, throwing off ejecta that puts a thrust on the asteroid,\\\" Dr Cheng says.\", \"That extra push depends upon the physical properties of the ejecta, Dr Statler adds.\", \"\\\"That's the part that can't really be predicted without doing it.\", \"If it goes to plan,\\u00a0the spacecraft will decrease the orbit time of the smaller rock by about 1 millimetre per second \\u2014\\u00a0or 1 per cent of its\\u00a0orbit speed.\", \"That might not sound like much, but it makes a big difference, Dr Cheng says.\", \"\\\"The difference is very easy to measure with ground-based telescopes because in just a matter of weeks, it means that the time that you see the eclipses is changed by hours.\", \"\\\"So over a year or a few years, that difference is enough to make the asteroid miss the Earth if it was headed for the Earth.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How would this work if we were really under threat?</div>\", \"DART is simply a test of the technique, Dr Statler says.\", \"\\\"Part of the international discussion going forward\\u00a0on planetary defence already is how prepared do we actually need to be? Do we need to have a spacecraft ready to go? Do we need to have a launch vehicle ready to go?\", \"\\\"Those are questions that aren't going to be answered by DART because [it] is not a test of our infrastructure \\u2026\\u00a0or governmental systems.\\\"\", \"In the meantime, Dr Statler says\\u00a0NASA is beefing up its early warning systems and\\u00a0planning to build\\u00a0an infrared space telescope called the Near-Earth Object Surveyor\\u00a0to search for near-Earth objects.\", \"\\\"That's going to go a long way toward finding the 60 per cent or so of the near-Earth asteroid population that is still undiscovered,\\\" Dr Statler says.\", \"By detecting asteroids early enough, it might give NASA time to launch a spacecraft to nudge the asteroid off course.\", \"\\\"What you're trying to do is predict collisions well enough in advance that you can nudge the asteroid for a little bit and\\u00a0let that nudge build\\u00a0up over a few years so that when you get to that place where you were going to have a collision, the asteroid arrives 10 minutes earlier or 10 minutes later and misses.\\\"\", \"DART took eight years to build and will take 10 months to reach its asteroid.\", \"If there was enough advanced warning, Dr Cheng said it could be possible to put some of the components of DART into existing spacecraft.\", \"\\\"If you did that, then you would be able to [develop a mission] within a very short notice, maybe even as little as one year,\\\" Dr Cheng said.\", \"But first, we have to find out if the technique\\u00a0even works.\"]","href_hash":"b52dbf7d4c8a11eca18d8162f63c8e07"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b52dbf7d4c8a11eca18d8162f63c8e07"}},
