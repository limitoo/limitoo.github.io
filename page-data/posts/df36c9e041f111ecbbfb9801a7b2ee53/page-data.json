The jab was found to be \\\"safe and very well-tolerated\\\" in this age group.\", \"India has so far given more than 570 million doses of three previously approved vaccines - Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V. The government aims to vaccinate all Indians by the end of this year.\", \"About 13% of eligible adults have been fully vaccinated and 47% have received at least one shot since the beginning of the drive in January.\", \"India has reported more than 32 million Covid cases, second only to the US.

The vaccine maker believes this reaffirmed the jab's \\\"efficacy against the mutant strains\\\", especially the highly infectious Delta variant.\", \"Previous DNA vaccines have worked well in animals but not humans.\", \"The challenge, say scientists, was how to push the plasmid DNA into the human cell so that it gives a durable immune response.\", \"Dr Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in Shreveport, told the BBC that it was imperative that the efficacy data of the vaccine \\\"be vetted independently\\\".\", \"The other potential drawback is that ZyCoV-D requires three doses, instead of two as is the case with the other two candidates being used in India. The vaccine maker says it is evaluating at a two-dose jab.\", \"The firm plans to make up to 120 million doses of India's second home-grown vaccine every year. It is expected to be made available in September.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What are other vaccines that India has recently approved?</div>\", \"India has also approved Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine for emergency use. The jab is the second foreign vaccine to be granted emergency use authorisation in India. \", \"The vaccine, which has shown 85% efficacy, will be introduced in India through a supply agreement with homegrown vaccine maker Biological E.\", \"It's still unclear when the vaccine will be available for use in India. \", \"In June, the federal government gave approval to Indian pharma company Cipla to import Moderna vaccine - it has shown nearly 95% efficacy. \", \"But some reports say the vaccine is not likely to be made available in India until 2022 because of a \\\"supply crunch\\\". \", \"The government is also preparing to use a local version of Novavax vaccine, which will be produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII). The vaccine was more than 90% effective in a late-stage US-based clinical trial, according to the company.\", \"SII's CEO Adar Poonwalla has said he hoped to launch the vaccine, known as Covovax in India, by September.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What about the Biological E vaccine?</div>\", \"The government has placed an order for 300 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine from Biological E -  it was developed in collaboration with US-based Dynavax and Baylor College of Medicine.\", \"The $206m (\\u00a3145m) order is the first India has signed for a jab that has not received emergency approval.\", \"The unnamed vaccine is in the key third phase of clinical trials - the vaccine is given to thousands of people and tested for efficacy and safety - after showing \\\"promising results\\\" in the first two phases, the government said in a statement.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What do we know about Sputnik V?</div>\", \"The vaccine, developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute, initially generated some controversy after being rolled out before the final trial data had been released.

The All India Drug Action Network at the time said that it was \\\"baffled to understand the scientific logic\\\" to approve \\\"an incompletely studied vaccine\\\". \", \"Both the manufacturer and drug regulator defended Covaxin, saying it was \\\"safe and provides a robust immune response\\\". \", \"Bharat Biotech said that Indian clinical trial laws allowed \\\"accelerated\\\" authorisation for use of drugs after the second phase of trials for \\\"unmet medical needs of serious and life-threatening diseases in the country\\\". \", \"It has promised to make available the full data for third phase of trials in July.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What about Covishield?</div>\", \"The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is being manufactured locally by SII. \", \"The vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees.
