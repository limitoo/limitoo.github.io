The springtime weather is all wrong for a huge harvest-season feast. Cranberries of any kind are hard to source. Curious Australian friends want to understand the story behind the holiday, when many \\u2014 including my family \\u2014 have taken the good from the day and rejected the origin story, which is mostly fiction.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s about eating together and being thankful,\\u201d we tell them. In recent years, my son\\u2019s teenage friends have started showing up for the holiday, wearing suits and bearing bottles of wine, fascinated by our American conventions. I make them tell us what they\\u2019re thankful for before we eat \\u2014 a ritual I hated as a jaded teenager \\u2014 but one that they approach with gusto.\", \"Yesterday at my table, many people mentioned how thankful they were for our newfound freedom after almost two years of intermittent lockdowns. We expressed gratitude that we might see our loved ones again soon, after being separated for so long after federal and state border closures. We were thankful for our health, for vaccines, for one another.\", \"Missing from our table was my closest friend, an American who also lives here in Melbourne. She hates thanksgiving: as a lifelong vegetarian she\\u2019s repelled by a holiday that centers on a large dead bird; as a critical thinker, she\\u2019s appalled by a holiday that glosses over the violence that marked the colonization of the Americas. I\\u2019m sympathetic to her disdain, but I also feel strongly that traditions can change and adapt, and as long as we\\u2019re not hurting anyone we should grab our joy where we can (I concede that the turkey might disagree). Taking a day to be together and explicitly tell one another that we are thankful for our kinship feels especially vital this year, when we\\u2019ve missed out on so much togetherness.\", \"Unlike Halloween, which is slowly making inroads in Australian culture among school-aged children, Thanksgiving will never catch on here outside of expat gatherings like the one at my house. But perhaps it might inspire more of us to pause and think about the gifts we\\u2019ve been granted, and recognize the goodness in our lives. I see no downside to that.\", \"Are there celebrations in your life that you brought from other cultures? What do you think they might teach Australia?
