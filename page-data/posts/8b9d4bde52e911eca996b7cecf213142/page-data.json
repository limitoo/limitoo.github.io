Butterfield, amid doubts that Democrats will be able to hold the majority in 2022.\", \"\\\"Running every two years is pretty tough; it's a tough schedule. A lot of the people who are retiring have been in Congress a long time,\\\" he told CBS News in November. \\\"If I was [a Republican], today-- yeah if the election was today, they'd take the House for sure. It's one year - a long year - until the next election.\\\"\", \"DeFazio is an original founder of the Progressive Congressional Caucus that has bucked party leadership on the issues of transportation and international trade deals.
