Is there any harm in eating produce stickers?\", \"While the stickers that get placed on fruits and vegetables won\\u2019t cause you any harm, it\\u2019s probably best to remove them before eating.\", \"PLU stickers, which stands for \\u201cPrice Look Up,\\u201d serve an important function in grocery stores: telling the clerk how much to charge for that item. In the United States, about half of fresh produce doesn\\u2019t arrive in packaging, so the sticker is the main source of information on what type of produce it is and how it was grown. (Stickers that start with the numbers 3 or 4 mean the item was grown conventionally, and those starting with 9 indicate the item was grown organically.)\", \"\\u201cBecause produce stickers have contact with food, the intended use of these stickers is the subject of premarket approval by the Food and Drug Administration, to ensure that any substances that may migrate to food from the use of the sticker is safe,\\u201d said a spokeswoman for the agency in an email. \\u201cAs these stickers are intended to be removed before consumption of produce, the F.D.A.\\u2019s review does not include the exposure that would result from regular consumption of these labels. However, as these substances are of low toxicity, any exposure from the occasional, unintentional consumption of a sticker would not be expected to be a health concern.\\u201d\", \"There are three main components to the sticker, according to Ed Treacy, vice president of supply chain and sustainability for the Produce Marketing Association (PMA), the organization that invented the produce -ticker system decades ago. There\\u2019s the ink, which spells out the PLU number; there\\u2019s the substrate it\\u2019s printed on (typically plastic, plastic composite or paper); and there\\u2019s the adhesive, which makes it stick. \\u201cAll three of those have to be safe for humans,\\u201d Mr. Treacy said.\", \"Though the stickers are edible, they have no flavor and no nutritional value. And there is an environmental downside to not removing them before discarding skins, peels and other parts that you don\\u2019t eat: Produce stickers are not home compostable, so they won\\u2019t break down in the compost.\", \"When it comes to making the stickers biodegradable: \\u201cThat is a challenge that our industry is spending a lot of time, effort and money trying to solve,\\u201d Mr. Treacy said. \\u201cThe challenge is the adhesive\\u201d \\u2014 finding something that is sticky enough to stay stuck to the fruit or vegetable throughout the entire supply chain.\", \"\\u201cFor something to be compostable, it has to be made out of natural ingredients \\u2014 something that was once alive and is now dead,\\u201d said Jean Bonhotal, director of the Cornell Waste Management Institute. She explained that every time you forget to remove the label before tossing your banana peel, avocado skin or orange peel in your countertop compost bin, those stray stickers contaminate the compost with tiny microplastics that, in turn, contaminate the soil where that batch of compost gets dropped.\", \"Just one more reason to remove the sticker and place it in the trash before enjoying your fruits or vegetables.\"]","href_hash":"3b31aa2046c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3b31aa2046c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
