Sacks of heroin. Wads of cash. The kinds of things that shouldn\\u2019t be dropped, but no one would have a heart attack if you did.\", \"And then there are the 2,281 fragile, invaluable and often museum-worthy art objects \\u2014 statues, sculptures, relics of ancient civilizations \\u2014 that the office has seized and now must care for.\", \"Here, a bronze idol from India priced at $2 million. There, a vase from Italy made 300 years before the birth of Christ.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve all gotten pretty good at packing,\\u201d said Matthew Bogdanos, the assistant district attorney who directs the 14-person unit that seized it all. \\u201cIt\\u2019s one thing to pack a bronze or sandstone statue \\u2014 it\\u2019s another to pack an 2,500-year-old Apulian vase that already has a crack down the side.

Set up in 2017, with the approval of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., to curb the smuggling of cultural heritage, it has seized 3,604 illicit items valued at $204 million. Of that, 1,323 objects have been returned to countries of origin like Mexico, Afghanistan and Tibet.\", \"Still, that leaves a lot of very nice stuff to watch over.\", \"\\u201cIt does catch my attention,\\u201d Vance said, \\u201cthat we have some extraordinarily important pieces of art and patrimony we need to secure carefully, and that\\u2019s not something most offices have to worry about.\\u201d\", \"Key to the operation are five analysts who sort, curate and conserve the collection and have educational and professional pedigrees that make them just as comfortable in the world of culture as criminology.\", \"Apsara Iyer, for example, is an expert in cultural heritage with degrees from Yale and Oxford; her five languages include Hindi and Spanish. Mallory O\\u2019Donoghue holds a master\\u2019s of science in art history from Glasgow University and once worked at the auction houses Christie\\u2019s and Sotheby\\u2019s.\", \"They help with investigations but also manage \\u201cthe collection,\\u201d which is held in two on-site rooms for smaller items like Etruscan amphoras and Hindu icons, and a larger off-site area for massive objects like Assyrian and Khmer statuary.\", \"Objects are labeled, code-coded and categorized based on their legal case and subdivided into wings and sections. Some of the wings are named after the accused traffickers whose items were seized \\u2014 Kapoor, Wiener, Medici.

Nope.

Investigators say the maiden was in the possession of a convicted Italian antiquities trafficker, Giacomo Medici, before surfacing at Merrin Gallery in 1997. The piece, which Italian officials say was looted from its original site near Rome, is rare because it retains the fingerprints of the artisan who molded it before firing it in a kiln.\", \"This 42-inch-high gray schist item was seized in 2012 from a storage area controlled by Subhash Kapoor, an art dealer who authorities have identified as one of the world\\u2019s most prolific antiquities traffickers. Extensive chisel marks across the back reveal the crude methods used by looters in hacking it from its ancient site. Kapoor is accused by the district attorney\\u2019s office of smuggling it from Pakistan in 2005, paying $3,500 to have the sword reattached and pricing it at more than $1.75 million for sale at his gallery.\", \"Valued at $500,000, the piece was looted from a northern Indian shrine before 2005, the authorities say. In 2006, it was obtained from an associate in India by Kapoor, the indicted New York antiquities dealer and restored by a British conservator, Richard Salmon, who has been convicted of fraud in the case. The statue, on display at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan, was seized by the district attorney\\u2019s office in 2012. Authorities say Kapoor, awaiting trial in India, will ultimately be extradited to face charges filed in New York.\", \"Investigators removed the 32-inch-tall krater on May 18, 2021, from Fordham University\\u2019s Museum of Greek, Etruscan and Roman Art in the Bronx. The museum had received it as a gift from an alumnus who had purchased it on the market. The painted ceramic, valued at $100,000, features a seated youthful warrior surrounded by figures with offerings on its obverse. It was recovered during the office\\u2019s investigation into Edoardo Almagi\\u00e0, an Italian-born, New York-based antiquities dealer. who left the United States for Rome in 2003 and remains under investigation.\", \"In the late 20th century, amid decades of conflict and genocide, hundreds if not thousands of Khmer icons of all sizes were looted from Cambodia and sold illicitly overseas. This Harihara, valued at $175,000, was seized on July 18, 2012, from a storage unit belonging to the indicted trafficker Kapoor. It is unclear which Cambodian temple it was taken from, and it is being held as evidence in the case against Kapoor.\", \"This antefix, valued at $97,425, is one of four that officials say were stolen from the Cerveteri Necropolis, a burial site outside of Rome, by an Italian looting network, 1994-1996. Investigators say they were sold to a New York collector in 1996 by Almagi\\u00e0. The antefixes were seized on Aug. 4, 2021, from a New York collector who had purchased them on the market.\", \"Valued at up to $600,000, this portrait bust was seized in 2020 from Christie\\u2019s New York, where it had been up for sale. In 1985, Italian authorities say, armed robbers stole it from Santa Maria Capua Vetere, a town in Italy\\u2019s Campanian region. It was laundered through the Zurich antiquities market in 1998, then acquired by \\u201ca private Swiss collector,\\u201d investigators say. The marble head resurfaced on the auction market in 2019, and was spotted in an auction catalog, leading investigators to pursue its seizure.\", \"This sinuous idol was seized in 2012. Valued at $2 million, it is one of many bronze statues and icons that were stolen before 2008 from a temple in India, by Sanjeevi Asokan, a Kapoor associate and a convicted antiquities looter and smuggler based in Chennai. Kapoor is still awaiting trial in India in addition to the charges he faces in New York. A clue to the statue\\u2019s origins is on its base, where a Tamil inscription translates to \\u201cSuthamalli,\\u201d the name of the village where the temple is.\"]","href_hash":"d141a361479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d141a361479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}},
