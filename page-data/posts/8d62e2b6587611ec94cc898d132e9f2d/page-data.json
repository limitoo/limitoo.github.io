Improving ratios on a faster timeline than that set out in the Action Plan could exacerbate pressure on teacher supply. Services could therefore struggle to employ enough teachers to meet minimum requirements for qualifications and adult-to-child ratios,\\\" the paper said.\", \"\\\"The phased timeframes of the Action Plan are also intended to manage the associated fiscal costs. If these changes are brought in at the same time as planned changes to teacher qualification requirements and improvements to teachers' salaries, the associated cost would increase significantly,\\\" it said.\", \"The paper said the regulations included much more than the areas covered by the complaint and covered aspects of early learning such as qualification requirements and service size.\", \"The rules require 2.5 square metres of clear space per child inside, and five square metres outside.\", \"Centres must have one teacher for up to five children under the age of two, one teacher for up to six children over the age of two, and for more than six over-twos a ratio of at least one to 10.\", \"One of the people who took the complaint to the select committee, early childhood teacher Susan Bates, said she was disappointed but not surprised the government would not bring forward its review.\", \"\\\"There's nothing in that government response that mentions children's wellbeing or the cost to children. They're talking about the cost to the sector and the cost to corporates and the cost of having to go to Treasury for more money but no-one's talking about the cost to children and that's what we see every day,\\\" she said.\", \"Bates said the complaint was motivated by concern the regulations were not supported by any evidence.\", \"\\\"Teachers have been telling us for years that the ratios and space per child and group sizes were a major concern for them, their health and their workload and of course for children's wellbeing,\\\" she said.\"]","href_hash":"8d62e2b6587611ec94cc898d132e9f2d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8d62e2b6587611ec94cc898d132e9f2d"}},
