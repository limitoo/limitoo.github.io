That is about 20 percent of Christchurch's current residential electricity use.\", \"The park will support future development of green fuel production for land and air transport, green data centres and green vertical farming.\", \"It was launched this afternoon with Energy Minister Megan Woods, Climate Change Minister James Shaw and Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel planting two k\\u014dwhai trees on its site, next to the century-old k\\u014dwhai the park is named after.\", \"Australian renewable energy fund Solar Bay was committing $100 million to the development of Phase One.\", \"Investment director Jack Sherratt said there was nothing else like this in New Zealand.\", \"\\\"It's innovative, far ahead of its time and absolutely world-leading in every sense,\\\" Sherratt said.\", \"\\\"The Phase One solar array is 50 times larger than any existing array in the country - and it's just the beginning.

We've reduced 85 percent of our direct emissions and we're on track to be carbon zero well before the city's goal of 2030 and New Zealand's goal of 2050.\", \"\\\"We want to enable the rest of the economy to decarbonise at the fastest possible rate.
