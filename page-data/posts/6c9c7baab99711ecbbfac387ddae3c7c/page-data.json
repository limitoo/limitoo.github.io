Now, it seems Moscow is trying to fix that problem.\\u00a0\", \"President Vladimir Putin's military \\u2014 accused of committing war crimes in its failed attempt to capture the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv \\u2014 has put General Alexander Dvornikov in charge of Russia's invasion, according to a U.S. official.\", \"Dvornikov previously led Russia's forces in Syria, where the United Nations accused them of committing war crimes including airstrikes targeting civilian areas and infrastructure.\", \"The commander's appointment to take over Russian operations in Ukraine comes after a catalogue of military failures. Russian forces were defeated in the battle for Kyiv and have withdrawn from around the capital city.\", \"The security situation in Kyiv has improved so dramatically that on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky walked through the middle of the city with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. \", \"\\\"We simply wish to keep on supporting the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes,\\\" Johnson said.

As the city remains under siege, it hasn't yet been possible for people to emerge from their hiding places to take account of the true cost of Russia's assault.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"6c9c7baab99711ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6c9c7baab99711ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
