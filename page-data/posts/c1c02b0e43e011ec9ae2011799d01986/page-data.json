One of the best offerings is \\u201cNothing New,\\u201d a melancholic meditation Swift wrote in 2012 and returned to nearly a decade later, enlisting the singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers as her very capable duet partner. The song is kind of a shadow version of \\u201cThe Lucky One,\\u201d Swift\\u2019s incisive but ultimately peppy track about the price of fame on the original release of \\u201cRed.\\u201d \\u201cNothing New\\u201d is much darker in tone and more sharply critical of a culture that moves from one young ing\\u00e9nue to the next: \\u201cHow can a person know everything at 18 but nothing at 22?\\u201d Swift asks, foreshadowing some of the themes she\\u2019d explore on her 2020 album \\u201cFolklore.\\u201d Most striking, though, is the bridge, in which she imagines meeting the Eve Harrington to her Margo Channing, a predecessor with \\u201cthe kind of radiance you only have at 17.\\u201d It\\u2019s hard not to picture the longtime Swiftie Olivia Rodrigo (\\u201cShe\\u2019ll know the way and then she\\u2019ll say she got the map from me\\u201d), who seems to have fulfilled this prophecy to a T. But in the time that has passed from when Swift wrote this song to when she finally recorded it, the mournful \\u201cNothing New\\u201d has transformed into something triumphant: It\\u2019s proof that Swift has outlasted her novelty and stuck around longer than her detractors imagined. Plus, she doesn\\u2019t seem to mind Rodrigo calling her \\u201cmom.\\u201d LINDSAY ZOLADZ\", \"Beach House\\u2019s music contains many gifts, but it\\u2019s the group\\u2019s ability to magnify life\\u2019s small dramas into sky-sized emotions that glitters. \\u201cSuperstar\\u201d is a prodigious torch song that fits comfortably among other beloved anthems in the band\\u2019s catalog: the blissed-out \\u201cMyth,\\u201d the romance of \\u201cLover of Mine.\\u201d Here, the duo immerses itself in the cosmos, the trick of light of a falling star guiding the nightmare of a relationship\\u2019s end. \\u201cWhen you were mine/We fell across the sky,\\u201d sings Victoria Legrand as the band once again harnesses an indescribable feeling and bottles it. ISABELIA HERRERA\", \"There\\u2019s nothing subtle about the message of Black striving and ambition in \\u201cBe Alive,\\u201d Beyonc\\u00e9\\u2019s song for \\u201cKing Richard,\\u201d the movie about the father and tennis coach of Venus and Serena Williams. \\u201cThis is hustle personified/Look how we\\u2019ve been fighting to stay alive,\\u201d she sings. \\u201cSo when we win we will have pride.\\u201d The beat is blunt, steady and determined, and as Beyonc\\u00e9 pushes her voice toward a rasp, she girds herself in vocal harmonies, a multitracked family. The song insists on the community effort behind the triumph. JON PARELES\", \"\\u201cOpen the gates, we arrive \\u2014 energy time,\\u201d Camae Ayewa (a.k.a. Moor Mother) commands in the title track to the new album by Irreversible Entanglements, which backs her spoken words with a shape-shifting jazz quartet. \\u201cOpen the Gates\\u201d is a concise but packed two-and-a-half minutes, with a six-beat bass vamp holding together prismatic, multilayered percussion and horns \\u2014 a welcome that promises eventful times ahead. PARELES\", \"\\u201cAmores de Droga\\u201d doesn\\u2019t require much to glow: a steady four-on-the-floor rhythm, the weightless melodies of the Mexican R&B chanteuse Girl Ultra, a couple of bleeding-heart lyrics. \\u201cA mi nadie me ense\\u00f1\\u00f3 a querer,\\u201d Girl Ultra sings. \\u201cYo no nac\\u00ed pa\\u2019 enamorarme.\\u201d (\\u201cNo one taught me how to love/I wasn\\u2019t born to fall in love.\\u201d) It\\u2019s a refutation \\u2014 a detox from poisonous love and all its dangers. HERRERA\", \"Ethiopia is consumed in a civil war as its Tigray ethnic minority, formerly in control, moves against a democratically elected government that has been taking its own brutal measures. On Nov. 2, the government declared a state of emergency. That was the day Teddy Afro released \\u201cArmash,\\u201d a nine-minute plea for Ethiopian unity sung in Amharic. It has two chords, an expanding horn line and a voice with deep sadness and a tinge of Auto-Tune, as he sings, \\u201cLonging for a country, here, in my own motherland.\\u201d It has logged more than three million listens on YouTube, but music can\\u2019t heal everything. PARELES\", \"In 2017 Melanie Charles self-released \\u201cThe Girl With the Green Shoes,\\u201d a tantalizing, 30-minute mixtape that sampled Kelela, Nina Simone and Buddy Miles, and shined a light on Charles\\u2019s rangy talents as a vocalist, flutist and producer. She returns this week with \\u201cY\\u2019all Don\\u2019t (Really) Care About Black Women,\\u201d her debut for the major jazz label Verve, and this one is a mixtape too, of sorts: She samples or reworks a song by a different Black woman ancestor on nearly every track. Abbey Lincoln gets covered twice, in a medley that starts with \\u201cAll Africa,\\u201d a rolling rumination on the ancient power of the drum originally on \\u201cWe Insist! Max Roach\\u2019s Freedom Now Suite.\\u201d Charles layers four-part harmony and swathes of effects onto an incantation of \\u201cThe beat!\\u201d and her band kicks into a scorching, slow-motion groove. It opens onto a blasted-out cover of \\u201cThe Music Is the Magic,\\u201d one of Lincoln\\u2019s most enchanted compositions, but after just over a minute, it fades out. The proof of concept is there. Now we\\u2019re waiting for more. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO\", \"Most of Shamir\\u2019s songs have been wrapped in sweetness. Not this one. \\u201cCisgender\\u201d is an uncompromising declaration of gender fluidity: \\u201cI don\\u2019t wanna be a girl, I don\\u2019t wanna be a man,\\u201d Shamir declares. \\u201cI\\u2019m just existing on this God-forsaken land/You can take it or leave it.\\u201d The track is industrial, with brute-force drums and distorted guitar, insisting that limits are being pushed; variations of a four-letter word pop up in the lyrics. In the video, the singer has deer horns and cloven hooves. PARELES\", \"There\\u2019s sleek, poppy sheen to Mitski\\u2019s latest single, the second from her newly announced sixth album, \\u201cLaurel Hell,\\u201d but beneath the distortion-scorched surfaces of her early work, she\\u2019s been writing melodies this catchy and anthemic since her great 2014 album \\u201cBury Me at Makeout Creek.\\u201d Co-written with Semisonic\\u2019s Dan Wilson, \\u201cThe Only Heartbreaker\\u201d is propelled by punchy percussion and retro-sounding synthesizers that explode into a dramatic conflagration during the song\\u2019s bridge. Like so many of Mitski\\u2019s best songs, this one is about embracing emotionality and the inevitability of messiness: \\u201cI\\u2019ll be the bad guy in the play,\\u201d she tells a relatively reserved partner. \\u201cI\\u2019ll be the water main that\\u2019s burst and flooding/You\\u2019ll be by the window, only watching.\\u201d ZOLADZ\", \"\\u201cLast month in Alaska,\\u201d Evan Stephens Hall sings at the beginning of the latest song from Pinegrove, stretching out those vowels with a twangy sense of yearning. (In the next verse, impressively, he\\u2019ll wring a similar kind of musicality out of the word \\u201cOrlando.\\u201d) Taken from the New Jersey indie-rockers\\u2019 forthcoming album \\u201c11:11\\u201d (out Jan. 28), \\u201cAlaska\\u201d is one of those cozy winter songs you want to wrap around yourself like a wool blanket. The lyrics showcase the vivid poeticism of Hall\\u2019s writing (\\u201clike a ladder to the atmosphere, the rungs each come again and again\\u201d) while the song\\u2019s driving rhythm and fuzzy guitars create an atmosphere that\\u2019s at once emotionally restless and as warm as a hearth. ZOLADZ\", \"Following the righteous punk anger of Camp Cope\\u2019s great 2018 album \\u201cHow to Socialize & Make Friends,\\u201d the Australian trio\\u2019s first single in three years is something of a departure: \\u201cBlue\\u201d is a twangy, acoustic-driven reflection, its sonic palette akin to something off Waxahatchee\\u2019s \\u201cSt. Cloud.\\u201d But subsequent listens reveal singer Georgia Maq\\u2019s emotional perception to be as receptive and unflinching as ever, as the song depicts a relationship in which both partners are struggling with their own forms of depression: \\u201cIt\\u2019s all blue, you know I feel it and I bet you do.\\u201d ZOLADZ\", \"\\u201cTwo Ribbons,\\u201d the title song of an album due in April, puts a serene facade on all-consuming grief. It backs Jenny Hollingworth\\u2019s voice with, mostly, two chords from a calmly strummed electric guitar, along with underlying tones; Velvet Underground songs like \\u201cPale Blue Eyes\\u201d are predecessors. Her voice and her words cope with suffering, death, mourning, survival, and moving on; the song is quietly shattering. PARELES.\", \"Mdou Moctar, a Tuareg guitarist and singer born in Niger, and the other three members of his band, set up to perform on a bank of the Niger River during a scenic sunrise to play four songs \\u2014 \\u201cTala Tannam,\\u201d \\u201cBissmilahi Atagh,\\u201d \\u201cYa Habibti\\u201d and \\u201cChismiten\\u201d \\u2014 from the album they released this year, \\u201cAfrique Victime.\\u201d With just two guitars, bass and calabash, the music is live, unadorned and pristinely recorded. Drone harmonies make it meditative, even as the rhythms and guitar lines streak ahead. PARELES\", \"The trumpeter and composer Adam O\\u2019Farrill has a way of showing his ambition by turning the volume down, asking the members of his quartet, Stranger Days, to play their spare but not-simple parts with measured intention, so that all four instruments can be heard at the same volume. On \\u201cDucks,\\u201d from \\u201cVisions of Your Other,\\u201d O\\u2019Farrill\\u2019s just-released album with Stranger Days, the drummer Zack O\\u2019Farrill (his brother) leaves space around every drum stroke. The busiest it gets is at the end of the track, when O\\u2019Farrill and the tenor saxophonist Xavier Del Castillo hold long notes together in taut harmony.
