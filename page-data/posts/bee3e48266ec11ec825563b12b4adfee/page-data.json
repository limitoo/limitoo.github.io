The crew roamed up and down the Pacific Coast Trail to shoot Witherspoon in 2014's \\\"Wild.\\\"\", \" \\\"They can move anywhere they want,\\\" the Canadian filmmaker said of his actors in a 2014 interview with The Associated Press. \\\"It's giving the importance to storytelling, emotion, characters. I try not to interfere too much. I don't need to cut performances. Often, the cinematographer and I were like, 'This location s-cks. It's not very nice. But, hey, that's life.'\\\"\", \" He re-teamed with Witherspoon to direct the first season of \\\"Big Little Lies\\\" in 2017, and directed Adams in 2018\\u2032s \\\"Sharp Objects,\\\" also for HBO.
