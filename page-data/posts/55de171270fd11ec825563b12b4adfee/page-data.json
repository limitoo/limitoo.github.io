The spike in cases coincided with a healthy dose of unsymptomatic folks who needed proof they were Covid-19-free in order to travel during the festive season.\", \"Big businesses had also been quick to order tests in bulk to ensure their workers could test regularly and continue showing up to work. Sporting teams, private schools and universities did the same.\", \"This put considerable pressure on testing systems. Providers of RAT tests were overrun while the healthcare staff carrying out PCR tests and analysing results in pathology labs couldn't keep up with demand, stretching out wait times and creating significant backlogs.\", \"Put simply, Omicron and holiday travel prompted a worldwide increase in demand for tests, and the supply chain wasn't quite ready.\", \"Read more about the Omicron variant:\", \"The Omicron variant, what you need to know\", \"Omicron may be less severe in some, but not mild - WHO\", \"Omicron spreads like wildfire, but major differences in global responses\", \"Head of the peak testing body Pathology Technology Australia, Dean Whiting, said shelves there were full to the brim with rapid tests in November, and most weren't moving that quickly.\", \"Some states were slower than others to jump on board and make rapid tests available for retail sale after they were approved for at-home use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration - Western Australia remains a hold-out, with a ban set to be lifted some time this month.\", \"\\\"It was only three or four weeks ago that governments\\u2026 started to indicate that these tests had a role and to articulate what that role was.

Most states are directing only those with symptoms or who are close contacts to line up for a PCR.\", \"Deakin University's professor Bennett said in future, testing should be focused on the places where a diagnosis is most important.\", \"\\\"In my view, we're running out of rapid antigen tests because we're not clear about when it should be used, when it's the most useful, when it makes a difference,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"When you have really high infection rates in the community, particularly in summer, if you have symptoms, you more than likely have Covid-19.\", \"\\\"If a positive test is going to change your management, you need to get tested. If you're someone who's vulnerable, who might still be at risk of severe illness... you need a definitive diagnosis so they can put you on monoclonal antibodies or antivirals.\\\"\", \"But for others, she said a positive test wouldn't change much.\", \"Professor Bennett said removing some of that load from the testing system would alleviate waiting times for PCR results and mean rapid antigen tests could be saved for high-risk settings such as healthcare, aged care and schools.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/283508/eight_col_075_cotA%C2%A9-notitle211218_npZiG.jpg?1640109123\\\" alt=\\\"Crowds line up in Times Square on 18 December 2021 to get tested for Covid-19 as cases sharply rise in the city ahead of the holidays.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nCovid-19 testing in New York's Times Square before Christmas.
