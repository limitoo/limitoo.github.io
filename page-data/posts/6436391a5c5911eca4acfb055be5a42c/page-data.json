According to the U.N.'s website, the security council's responsibility is to take the lead \\\"in determining the existence of a threat to the peace or act of aggression.\\\"\", \"Backed by Ireland and Niger, the proposition would have named climate change as a danger to international security, calling for \\\"incorporating information on the security implications of climate change\\\" so the council could \\\"pay due regard to any root causes of conflict or risk multipliers.\\\"\", \"It also would have called for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres to report on how to mitigate climate-related security risks, making them \\\"a central component\\\" of future strategies to prevent conflict.\", \"Russian and Indian officials argued that climate issues should stay in designated U.N. groups like the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Russia holds veto power due to its status as one of the five permanent members of the council.\", \"The officials also mentioned not wanting to rock the boat after November's U.N. climate talks in Glasgow ended with changing language requiring several countries to \\\"phase down\\\" coal energy rather than \\\"phase out,\\\" a decision many other nations said was too weak.\", \"While past council resolutions have mentioned the strong effects of climate change in certain regions of the world, this would have been the first solely dedicated to the topic.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950700/united-nations-new-york.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">India and Russia voted against a U.N.
