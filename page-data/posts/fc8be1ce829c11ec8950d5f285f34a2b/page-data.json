But commentators like Peter Kafka of Recode note a key difference between Spotify and those companies: Spotify directly paid a reported $100 million for the exclusive rights to Mr. Rogan\\u2019s podcast, and the company has noted that his show has increased its ad revenue. To some, that puts an extra onus on Spotify to act like a media company and take responsibility for content.\", \"How artists reacted:\", \"\\u201cI am going to do my best in the future to balance things out,\\u201d Mr. Rogan said in a video statement posted late Sunday. He agreed on the merits of putting a disclaimer on episodes that discuss the coronavirus. He also thanked Spotify for its support: \\u201cI\\u2019m very sorry that this is happening to them.\\u201d\", \"Beyond adding the content advisory notice, Spotify is also directing listeners to a page with information about Covid and has published its content policy rules. But Mr. Ek wrote in a public letter that the company must balance \\u201ccreator expression\\u201d with \\u201cthe safety of our users.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt is important to me that we don\\u2019t take on the position of being content censor,\\u201d he said in the letter.\", \"Other tech companies have said similar things when faced with their own platform dilemmas. It hasn\\u2019t necessarily settled their critics\\u2019 concerns.\"]","href_hash":"fc8be1ce829c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fc8be1ce829c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
