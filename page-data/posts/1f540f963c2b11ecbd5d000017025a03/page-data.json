Various crew members were spotted at the stadium starting to dismantle the letters.\", \"The process of removing the logo from the scoreboard has already proven to be a delicate one. Members were seen cutting into the \\\"I\\\" of the name and lifting it off of the board with a crane. This crane was located between two of the light towers seen at the ballpark. Work on the project had to be temporarily halted due to windy weather, which could be a common occurrence during the removal process.\", \"Over the next several days, the sign will be taken down and replaced by one with the team's new name, the Guardians. Once the process is complete, it will stay in storage until the team can agree on where to put it. The Guardians sign will be put onto the scoreboard by opening day 2022.\", \"The removal of the Indians sign showcases the definitive end to the team name, which was changed earlier this year after a national reevaluation of racist team names. Other signage with the term has been removed, and the Guardians will take over as the official team name in the next few weeks.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1924926/cleveland-name-removal.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Workers begin to remove the Cleveland Indians sign from above the scoreboard at Progressive Field on November 2 in Cleveland.

A Major League club cannot simply take a smaller team's name and use it for itself.\\\"\", \"In a statement, the Indians said they don't believe there is a conflict between the parties and they remain confident in their position to move forward with the name change.\"]","href_hash":"1f540f963c2b11ecbd5d000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1f540f963c2b11ecbd5d000017025a03"}},
