Alabama fans, who had watched Smart\\u2019s long apprenticeship under Nick Saban, counseled patience.\", \"Those worries have faded mightily this season. With the nation\\u2019s top defense \\u2014 Georgia has allowed an average of 7.5 points and about 236 yards per game \\u2014 any offensive shortcomings have been easy to overlook. Just this week, Nakobe Dean, a junior who has recorded seven tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks this season, was named a finalist for the Butkus Award, presented to the game\\u2019s best linebacker.\", \"The Bulldogs have not won a national title since the 1980 season. But the team managed back-to-back shutouts in Southeastern Conference play this season, a feat it had not achieved since that championship run.\", \"At No. 5 Michigan (10-1) on Saturday.

Stroud is a contender for the Heisman Trophy, largely because he has completed more than 71 percent of his passes and thrown 36 touchdowns while leading the country\\u2019s top offense.\", \"The Buckeyes are averaging almost 560 yards a game, 30.6 yards more than Pittsburgh in second.\", \"At Auburn (6-5) on Saturday. (3:30 p.m. on CBS)\", \"It is generally unwise to count the Crimson Tide out of any national title conversation. Still, Alabama, which routed Ohio State last season to win the championship, has sometimes seemed out of sorts this fall.\", \"There have been big wins \\u2014 it is Alabama, after all \\u2014 but also a loss at Texas A&M and one-touchdown escapes over a better-than-usual Arkansas and an absolutely abysmal Louisiana State.

Braylon Sanders has been a favorite target and is averaging 22.1 yards per reception, best in the SEC.\", \"Thursday\\u2019s Egg Bowl will test Mississippi\\u2019s defense, as Mississippi State and Coach Mike Leach run an Air Raid offense that leads the SEC in passing yards.\", \"At No. 7 Oklahoma State (10-1) on Saturday. (7:30 p.m. on ABC)\", \"The lone Big 12 program ever to reach the playoff, Oklahoma will head to its rivalry showdown in Stillwater focused on simply making the conference championship game.\", \"It has been an odd road to 10 wins. The Sooners survived Tulane, 40-35, to open the season. The next week, Oklahoma scored 76 and held Western Carolina to zero. Then came some narrow victories over teams like Kansas State and West Virginia. But Oklahoma did not lose until Nov. 13 at Baylor.\", \"Spencer Rattler, a preseason all-American, lost the starting quarterback job in mid-October.
