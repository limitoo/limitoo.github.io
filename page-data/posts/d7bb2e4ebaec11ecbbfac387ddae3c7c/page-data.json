As well as shortages of vital drugs, some procedures and tests have been suspended.\", \"The lack of foreign exchange has left President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's government unable to import essentials including medicines and fuel, causing crippling power cuts and bringing thousands of protesters on to the streets demanding that he be ousted.\", \"Reuters spoke to two government officials, six doctors and a healthcare union leader who said they had not seen Sri Lanka's health system in such a bad way before.\", \"An internal memo from a major state-run hospital in Colombo seen by Reuters said that only emergency, casualty and malignancy surgeries would be conducted from 7 April onwards because of a lack of surgical supplies.\", \"Sri Lanka's health ministry did not respond to detailed questions from Reuters about the problems facing the sector.\", \"The economy, which relies heavily on tourism, has been devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic and hit by the sharp rise in oil prices in the wake of the war in Ukraine, which has made importing enough fuel unaffordable.\", \"Some analysts have also criticised Rajapaksa's administration for its decision in 2019 to make deep tax cuts and delay talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Those negotiations are now going ahead.\", \"A close aide to the Rajapaksas has said previously that the tax cuts had been designed to boost the economy, but that Covid-19 then struck.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/290728/eight_col_000_327K26W.jpg?1649027250\\\" alt=\\\"Protestors in in Colombo during a demonstration against price rises and shortages of fuel and other essential commodities, 3 April 2022.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nProtesters in Colombo during a demonstration against price rises and shortages of fuel and other essential commodities on 3 April. \\nPhoto: AFP\\n</div>\", \"Sri Lanka now has just $1.93 billion in foreign exchange reserves, the equivalent of less than a month's imports, while government debt repayments of twice that amount are due in 2022.\", \"The Sri Lanka Medical Association, the country's oldest professional medical body, wrote to Rajapaksa last week warning him that even emergency treatments may have to be stopped in the coming days.\", \"\\\"This will result in a catastrophic number of deaths,\\\" the association said.\", \"In late March, a 70-year-old woman was wheeled into a government-backed tertiary care hospital in a Colombo suburb.
