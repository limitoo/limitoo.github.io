In an email to AP, spokesman Ben Vihstadt said that Sununu \\\"condemns the tweet referencing 'bounties' and any sort of financial incentive is wholly inappropriate and has no place.\\\"\", \"The events were spurred by the recent passing of a new law in the state that aims to combat the growing fear of critical race theory, a catch-all term for education that teaches systemic racism and other potentially divisive topics.\", \"AP reported that Sununu signed the bill into law as part of the new state budget and that the law \\\"would prohibit teaching children that they are inferior, racist, sexist or oppressive by virtue of their race, gender or other characteristics.\\\"\", \"The new Department of Education website for teacher complaints consists of an online reporting form.
