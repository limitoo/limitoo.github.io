He concedes he was surprised by the sudden call-up.\", \"\\\"I was shocked to receive the phone call. It kind of came out of the blue. I thought I might be invited to a Brave Blossoms training camp or something like that, but to be selected for the actual Japan squad was amazing.\\\"\", \"The 19-year-old had only played a handful of games for Toshiba Brave Lupus in 2021 after leaving Kashiwa High School near Tokyo at the end of 2020.\", \"The son of former Silver Ferns player Tanya Dearns and former Hawkes Bay now NEC Green Rockets Tokatsu strength and conditioning coach Grant Dearns, Warner weighed up his options before signing with Toshiba and considered returning to New Zealand.\", \"\\\"After I finished high school at Kashiwa, I sort of put the feelers out there and had a few options. I didn't want to go to University in Japan and go through that system. I had the option to come back to New Zealand and try and pick up a contract there, but with Covid and everything it didn't seem like the right option at the time.\", \"\\\"Then a chance came up with Toshiba Brave Lupus at the start of this year and I talked to my Dad and others and we decided it was the best option.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/282875/eight_col_Warner_Dearns_Toshiba.jpg?1639426465\\\" alt=\\\"Warner Dearns playing for Toshiba Brave Lupus in Japan's Top League.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nDearns playing for Toshiba. \\nPhoto: Toshiba Brave Lupus\\n</div>\", \"He said his parents were thrilled at the prospect of their son playing for Japan, even with their obvious allegiances to Aotearoa.\", \"\\\"Mum and Dad were both very proud and despite Mum playing netball for New Zealand and us being Kiwis, they both were very excited and proud and told me to go for it.\\\"\", \"At six foot eight and 122 kilograms, it's easy to forget Dearns is still a teenager. Despite his imposing frame, he was still a bundle of nerves after being selected.\", \"\\\"At first I was really anxious. I wasn't sure if I deserved to be there or if I would be up to it. But, after a while those nerves turned into excitement at the fact I could be playing test rugby.\\\"\", \"Dearns carried doubts about whether he had earned the right to play test rugby.\", \"\\\"It all sunk in when I ran out onto the field and heard the Japanese anthem in the game against Portugal. Then it struck me that I'm an international rugby player.\", \"\\\"However, it wasn't until I got on, and I only got five minutes off the bench against Portugal, that I felt like I was where I was supposed to be. I felt like I truly belonged and that it was my destiny to be playing rugby for Japan and to be a test player.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/282876/eight_col_Warner_Dearns_Japan_1.jpg?1639426497\\\" alt=\\\"Warner Dearns playing for Japan.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nDearns playing for Japan alongside captain Michael Leitch. \\nPhoto: Japan Rugby Football Union\\n</div>\", \"Though it wasn't a clear cut decision to play for Japan. Dearns, like many young New Zealanders, had harboured ambitions of one day representing the All Blacks.\", \"\\\"At camp with the Brave Blossoms, when it came close to making my debut, that's when I started to think about how once I was capped, that might mean the end of a childhood dream to play for the All Blacks. Most kiwi kids dream of being an All Black and I was no different. However, I feel like I'm supposed to be here (playing for Japan) and I'm happy with my decision.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/282877/eight_col_Warner_Dearns_Japan_2.jpg?1639426561\\\" alt=\\\"Warner Dearns trains with Japan's Brave Blossoms.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nWarner Dearns trains with Japan's Brave Blossoms. \\nPhoto: Japan Rugby Football Union\\n</div>\", \"Dearns hopes he gets to square off against the All Blacks at some point.\", \"\\\"It will be a special occasion, a big occasion. Playing the All Blacks, if that ever happens, I would definitely have mixed emotions. But, it would be another dream come true to play against New Zealand.\\\"\", \"Dearns also believes Japan have earned the right to be included in the Rugby Championship, the southern hemisphere's showpiece test tournament, after impressive recent results against tier one nations and their quarter-final showing at the 2019 World Cup in the land of the rising sun.\", \"\\\"Having Japan in the Rugby Championship would be good for the growth of the game in Japan and globally. The Brave Blossoms deserve to be in a top international competition.\\\"\", \"While she encouraged her son to put his hat in with the Brave Blossoms, former Silver Fern Tanya Dearns was quick to point out the recent changes to World Rugby's eligibility rules, which allow a player to switch international teams after a three year stand down period.\", \"\\\"She rang me and told me the news and said, 'You can still play for the All Blacks one day'. She sent me a link to the rule changes and everything haha. She couldn't help herself. She's really proud of me for playing for Japan, but deep down you can tell she would love for me to represent New Zealand at some stage and play for the All Blacks.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"37a37a505d0f11ecac89f58fd9fc6b99"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"37a37a505d0f11ecac89f58fd9fc6b99"}},
