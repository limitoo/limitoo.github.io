Those on board pour a liquid, likely an accelerant, over the cargo hold as the Navy approaches. Smoke then pours from the vessel after those on board apparently set the fire, with an explosion rocking the ship.\", \"Sailors from the patrol craft USS Sirocco later arrived, rescuing the men. The sailors also recovered over 3,850 pounds of hashish, 1,100 pounds of methamphetamine and 66 pounds of heroin.\", \"(2/3) Images from the rescue and seizure pic.twitter.com/wyR1QG2lEs\", \"The Navy valued the recovered drugs at about $14.7 million, but Cmdr.
