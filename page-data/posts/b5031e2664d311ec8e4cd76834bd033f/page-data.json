All six, thankfully, have good prognoses, and yet it has made them \\u2014 and those of us in their immediate orbit \\u2014 assess more carefully how we live and how we\\u2019ve lived.\", \"Usually, I love this time of year. But in 2021 that joy is mixed up with sadness, too; December has a way of casting me adrift in time, remembering people who are gone. These days are precious, to be sure. But they can also be a time of loneliness and struggle, especially as we face down yet another variant and Covid isolation.\", \"That conversation with my friend about what it is we live for \\u2014 and when it\\u2019s OK to say you\\u2019ve finished your business, whatever that might be \\u2014 lingers with me.\", \"Do we really ever know for sure what our business here on earth actually is? When do you know you\\u2019ve lived a full life? How do you know when your business is complete?\", \"In Charles Dickens\\u2019s \\u201cA Christmas Carol,\\u201d the ghost of Jacob Marley tells his former business partner Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas Eve, \\u201cMankind was my business.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe common welfare was my business,\\u201d he moans. \\u201cCharity, mercy, forbearance and benevolence were all my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business.\\u201d\", \"Our country would appear to have a lot of work to do, if the goal really is to become a nation of charity, mercy, forbearance and benevolence.\", \"That work includes tackling poverty, climate change and racism head-on. But the business before us is not only about politics or economics. It\\u2019s also about letting people who are suffering know that they are not alone and that they are loved, that their dreams are possible.\", \"I know all too well what it feels like to suspect that your dreams are too big. When I was young, before I came out as trans, the rituals of the holiday all too keenly reminded me of the ways in which I had not become myself; at the time the fundamental challenge of my life just seemed impossible. I was lucky enough to find a path to my true self. Now I\\u2019m here on the outskirts of old age, feeling deeply loved by my family and by my friends \\u2014 including the six whose health is now in jeopardy.\", \"I know plenty of transgender people whose thoughts turn dark in December because a world of mercy and benevolence seems to have slipped far beyond their grasp.\", \"For a long time, my friend Helen Boyd (the author of \\u201cMy Husband Betty\\u201d) and I ran something we called the December Project. We\\u2019d offer, via social media, to call transgender people (and their loved ones) on the phone, people who might be sundered from their families at this time of year, people for whom a single friendly voice might make a world of difference. (We retired the project after it swelled beyond our ability to sustain it. Now some of this same work is done by, among others, the Trans Lifeline, at 877-565-8860.)\", \"Love is no small part of why I want to stick around and why (I hope) my friend will want to stick around, too. After our first conversation, he wrote me to clarify his thoughts: \\u201cIt\\u2019s not about whether my business is finished or not. It\\u2019s about believing that everything I\\u2019ve already done, I\\u2019ve already done. And everything that\\u2019s to come, well, that doesn\\u2019t exist yet anyhow.\\u201d He added, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have an attachment to climbing hills or achieving things. I\\u2019m content to wake up each day.\\u201d\", \"I\\u2019m content with that too, and part of the reason I\\u2019m content is my love for friends like him. The other part is curiosity \\u2014 and hope. Even with many of the things I have hoped and prayed for in this life already in hand, I\\u2019m still hungry to know what happens next.\", \"It puts me in mind of the film \\u201cThe Princess Bride,\\u201d when our hero, Westley, appears to have been slain in the torture chambers of the evil Count Rugen. But he\\u2019s carried off to Miracle Max, who finds that, instead of being \\u201call dead,\\u201d Westley is merely \\u201cmostly dead.\\u201d And mostly dead, Miracle Max observes, is still \\u201cslightly alive.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHey!\\u201d he says, inflating Westley\\u2019s chest with bellows. \\u201cHello in there! What\\u2019s so important? What you got here that\\u2019s worth living for?\\u201d\", \"The mostly dead man whispers, \\u201cTrue love.\\u201d\", \"Westley is right.
