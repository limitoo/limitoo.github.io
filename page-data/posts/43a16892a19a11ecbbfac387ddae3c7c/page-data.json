An attorney for the Laundries, Steven Bertolino, said in a text message Friday that his clients were fully within their rights not to talk. He also denied the lawsuit's claims in general.\", \"\\\"This lawsuit does not change the fact that the Laundries had no obligation to speak to law enforcement or any third party including the Petito family,\\\" Bertolino said. \\\"This fundamental legal principle renders the Petitos' claims to be baseless under the law.\\\"\", \"Petito and Laundrie were both from Blue Point, New York, but moved to his parents' Gulf Coast home in North Port, Florida, in 2019. It was Petito's van the couple took on their trip from Florida, which was intended to end on Halloween on the Pacific coast.\", \"The lawsuit says that until that trip and her disappearance, the families \\\"had a cordial relationship.\\\"\", \"\\\"Gabrielle Petito had hopes of becoming a travel influencer, a 'van-lifer' and document her cross-country travels\\\" on various social media sites, the lawsuit says.\", \"Petito had been in regular contact with her parents and posted frequently on social media about their travels, including YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. The couple had a regular following before the murder mystery took hold.\", \"The FBI says Laundrie sent text messages from Petito's cellphone to her parents and others in an effort to pretend she was still alive. He was also charged with illegally using one of her credit cards before his remains were discovered in the Florida nature preserve.\"]","href_hash":"43a16892a19a11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"43a16892a19a11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
