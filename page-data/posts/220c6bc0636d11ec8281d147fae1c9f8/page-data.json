COVID-19\\u00a0lockdown\\u00a0began has been forced to endure days of temperatures approaching\\u00a040C as she waits for it to be fixed.\", \"\\\"I feel angry, I feel tired\\u00a0and I sleep most of the time even though I'm sweating\\u00a0because I am tired,\\\" Valda Shannon said.\\u00a0\", \"Lockdowns in Tennant Creek and the remote community of Ali Curung were extended again\\u00a0on Wednesday, until 5pm today.\", \"Northern Territory\\u00a0Acting Chief Minister Nicole Manison said the extension was\\u00a0to give authorities more time to process\\u00a0423 COVID\\u00a0tests taken from Tennant Creek and 230 from Ali Curung\\u00a0and to drive up low vaccination rates in both communities \\u2014\\u00a0with\\u00a0full vaccination coverage at just\\u00a074 per cent in Tennant Creek and about\\u00a034 per cent in Ali Curung.\", \"For Ms Shannon, a Warlpiri and Warumungu woman, the direction means another day of sweltering conditions.\", \"She said she\\u00a0first reported her\\u00a0broken air conditioner to the NT's Department of Housing\\u00a0around 8:30am on Friday.\\u00a0\", \"Since then, she said she has spoken to several housing and welfare workers who have told her she's\\u00a0\\\"on their list\\\".\", \"More than four days later, she's still waiting for a response.\", \"<img

children, Ms Shannon regularly cares for her brother's children from the house next door.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We keep the kids between the two houses and work together to not let them out of the two houses,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"That really tires me out.\\\"\", \"Speaking at yesterday's COVID press conference,\\u00a0NT Police Commissioner Jamie Chalker said police were aware some\\u00a0residents in lockdown were facing issues related to public housing and air conditioning.\", \"\\\"I'm sure public housing tenants are well aware of the process for them to report repairs and maintenance,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We strongly encourage people to do that as soon as the fault presents itself.\\\"\", \"Late on Wednesday, a\\u00a0Department of Territory Families, Housing and Communities spokeswoman

50C, if not more,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"He said sweltering inside one of these homes without air conditioning was \\\"incredibly dangerous\\\".\", \"\\\"Once your core body temperature goes above
