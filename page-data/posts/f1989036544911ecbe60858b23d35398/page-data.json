The 73-point margin of victory was the largest in N.B.A. history.\", \"Even an arithmophobe could find some amazing numbers in the box score.\", \"The Thunder, for instance, were outscored by 56 points when Jeremiah Robinson-Earl (2 points on 0-7 shooting) was on the floor. Oklahoma City was outrebounded, 53-26, and had two steals against 19 turnovers.\", \"On the plus side, they made 82 percent of their free throws, better than the Grizzlies\\u2019 72 percent. Good thing too, or it might have really turned into a blowout.\", \"The happier-looking Grizzlies numbers included 27 points on 9 of 11 shooting for Jaren Jackson Jr. and nine assists in 21 minutes for Tyus Jones.

It also comes with grief and frustration and anger.\\u201d\", \"In the Thunder\\u2019s favor, they were missing their leading scorer, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who entered the concussion protocol on Thursday. Still, the Grizzlies were without their own star, Ja Morant, who has a knee injury.\", \"The Thunder have now lost eight straight and sit 6-16 in what was always expected to be another rebuilding year (last season they were 22-50). They still have a better record than the Pelicans, Rockets, Magic and Pistons (4-18!). But none of those teams, not even the Pistons, has lost by 73.\", \"The Thunder now have three nights off before a game on Monday at \\u2026 the Pistons.
