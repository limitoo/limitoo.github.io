It\\u2019s Anderson\\u2019s only film to date shot entirely in and around New York City, his sole entry in the canon of Gotham cinema, which was so formative to his youth in the Southwest.\", \"\\u201cI wanted to live in New York when I was young,\\u201d Anderson, a Houston native, confessed to The New York Daily News in 2012. \\u201cSo many books and plays and movies that I love were set in New York. It really gave me an idea of the city before I had even moved here.\\u201d\", \"But that wording \\u2014 \\u201can idea of the city\\u201d \\u2014 is telling. Anderson wasn\\u2019t seeking the authenticity and verisimilitude of a native New Yorker (a Spike Lee or Martin Scorsese, for example); in fact, though \\u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums\\u201d was shot on location, its settings are unrecognizable, and the places it name-checks leave Gothamites scratching their heads. The bulk of the action takes place in the shambling Tenenbaum home on \\u201cArcher Avenue,\\u201d though daughter Margot has \\u201ca private studio in Mockingbird Heights\\u201d and patriarch Royal has spent the past several decades at the \\u201cLindbergh Palace Hotel.\\u201d A secondary character teaches at \\u201cBrooks College\\u201d; others travel via the \\u201cGreen Line Bus\\u201d or the \\u201c22nd Avenue Express\\u201d train; mention is made of the \\u201cCity Public Archives,\\u201d \\u201cMaddox Hill Cemetery,\\u201d \\u201cLittle Tokyo,\\u201d \\u201cKobe General Hospital,\\u201d \\u201cthe Valenzuela Bridge\\u201d and, in a true feat of city-stretching ingenuity, \\u201cthe 375th St. Y.\\u201d\", \"The result is a New York that blurs fact and fiction, a fantasy vision of the city, less reflective of the realities of urban life than the fanciful notions of them ingrained in Anderson\\u2019s sensibility. Many an observer has noted the resemblances between the Tenenbaum brood and the Glass family of J.D. Salinger\\u2019s short fiction \\u2014 much of which initially appeared in The New Yorker, a publication whose wry, busy, detailed covers seem no small influence on Anderson\\u2019s idiosyncratic visual style. (His most recent film, \\u201cThe French Dispatch,\\u201d takes the influence even further, unspooling like an issue of a New Yorker-style magazine.) Other literary influences from the city abound as well, including the colorful personalities of A.J. Liebling\\u2019s profiles, the strained family dynamics of John Cheever\\u2019s short stories, and the hotel life of Kay Thompson\\u2019s \\u201cEloise\\u201d books. In a way, \\u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums\\u201d is the inverse of many New York movies of the 1930s and 1940s \\u2014 when on-location photography was so rare, and film production so centralized in Hollywood, that ex-New Yorker writers and designers recreated an idealized, fantasy vision of Gotham on backlots and soundstages clear across the country.\", \"Anderson was far from a tourist when he made \\u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums\\u201d: after a bumpy migration from Texas to Los Angeles, he moved to Manhattan in 1999 and found it a better fit. (He currently lives in Paris.) Yet he maintained that apotheosized idea of the city, born from those formative years of consuming \\u201cTalk of the Town\\u201d items and witticisms from Algonquin alumni. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an alternate universe,\\u201d the historian Mark Asch writes in his book \\u201cNew York Movies,\\u201d explaining that it\\u2019s \\u201cfamiliar yet out of reach, like all the tattered books written by the Tenenbaums and dusty magazines featuring them on the cover.\\u201d\", \"The picture\\u2019s vague sense of geography extends to its historical timeliness. There are no contemporary references of note, and the costumes and cars are not of any specific era. The hotel where Royal first lives and then works feels transplanted from the 1940s (complete with multiple elevator operators), and the neighborhoods seem closer to the city of the \\u201970s than the 2000s \\u2014 a bit trashy, decorated by graffiti, prowled by rusted-out gypsy cabs and thoroughbred mice. \\u201cWes wanted it to be Nowheresville, New York, a kind of New York but not New York,\\u201d the production designer David Wasco explained to Newsday. He added that while the movie comes off as a valentine to New York, \\u201cthat was not intentional. We went to the trouble to redesign the license plates and the street signs, which are variations on the old yellow street signs with the camel bump on them. He\\u2019s really specific about wanting those things.\\u201d\", \"The Tenenbaum house on Archer Avenue seems a bit otherworldly as well. Anderson spent months searching for the right location. \\u201cIt needed to be a New York house that wasn\\u2019t stereotypical, and where you\\u2019d have a real strong sense of family history,\\u201d he told The New York Observer. Obviously, finding the kind of big, shambling, multilevel home he was looking for on the island of Manhattan was a big ask, but they finally found it in Hamilton Heights, specifically at 144th Street and Convent Avenue. Anderson was so in love with the house that he rewrote his script to better accommodate it, though contacting its owner for permission to shoot was, at first, difficult. The feat was ultimately accomplished by leaving a note on the door; the owners had been elusive because they had just purchased the vacant home, and had not yet begun their planned, and extensive, renovations. By the time Anderson and company rented it for six months of prep and shooting \\u2014 performing many of the structural repairs themselves \\u2014 the house had paid for itself.\", \"Yet for all of Anderson\\u2019s effort to place his film in a New York free of modern markers, one pang of recognition was unintended but unavoidable. Son Chas (Ben Stiller) is in the midst of a nervous breakdown following the death of his wife in a plane crash; he\\u2019s in a perpetual state of fear and paranoia, particularly about the safety of his sons. \\u201cIt\\u2019s been a rough year, Dad,\\u201d he tells his father near the end of the film, following a particularly, terrifyingly close call.\", \"For audiences at the New York Film Festival, where \\u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums\\u201d first unspooled in October 2001, Chas\\u2019s state of mind seemed undeniably, unnervingly contemporary.\"]","href_hash":"88bb9e185d0011ec8057ed862ac35646"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"88bb9e185d0011ec8057ed862ac35646"}},
