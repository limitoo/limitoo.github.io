It was a bright early fall day in Manhattan, and Davis reclined comfortably on a peeling park bench outside the Tompkins Square dog run in the East Village.\", \"\\u201cIf you cut yourself, it\\u2019ll heal, but there\\u2019s a mark there,\\u201d she added. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t know that for so long.\\u201d\", \"Jangling a leash in her other hand \\u2014 she was watching her friend\\u2019s dog, a miniature husky \\u2014 Davis fished a treat out of her coat pocket. She stretched a slender arm toward the dog and offered up the treat, which he sniffed and declined. Davis shrugged and settled back against the bench, folding her long legs comfortably.\", \"\\u201cEverything accumulates,\\u201d she said. She could have been talking about her latest character, but at this moment she was addressing herself. \\u201cThe idea of returning has always felt possible. Only in the last little while have I been like: Oh, no. Everything leaves a mark.\\u201d\", \"Davis, 34, is perhaps best known for her roles in the techno-dystopian Netflix series \\u201cBlack Mirror\\u201d and as a mechanically enhanced super soldier in the 2019 \\u201cTerminator\\u201d movie, \\u201cDark Fate.\\u201d But fans and critics have known her longer, owing particularly to her role as the programming virtuoso Cameron Howe on AMC\\u2019s \\u201cHalt and Catch Fire.\\u201d\", \"Starting on Thursday, she will star as Kirsten Raymonde in \\u201cStation Eleven,\\u201d a 10-part limited series from HBO Max that has been adapted from the 2014 science fiction novel by Emily St. John Mandel. Given the book\\u2019s runaway success \\u2014 it won the Arthur C. Clarke award and has sold more than 1.5 million copies \\u2014 the adaptation seems likely to draw Davis further into the spotlight. So does the timing: The story revolves around a deadly pandemic and its aftermath.\", \"But despite its sci-fi premise, \\u201cStation Eleven\\u201d isn\\u2019t styled as fantasy; it concerns itself more with investigating tragedy, personal trials and the marks they leave behind \\u2014 an uncanny future artifact of our very real pandemic age. (The show, shot in Chicago and Toronto, began filming in January 2020.)\", \"For Davis, playing Kirsten was an opportunity to demonstrate her emotional range. It was also a chance for her to grapple with her own intense feelings of loss and isolation.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s been an unsettling few years,\\u201d Davis said, with a flat laugh.\", \"She seemed very ready to press ahead.\", \"We drained our coffees and decided to wander through the East Village in search of something to eat. Willowy and tall, Davis has shoulder-length blond hair and wide, clear eyes. That day she wore loose jeans and Doc Martens. She clicked her tongue at the dog and crossed onto East Seventh Street before cocking her head and considering a tiny taco shop: \\u201cSeems good?\\u201d\", \"Davis feels at home in New York City, though she lived here only briefly. She grew up in Vancouver, went to college in Montreal and then moved to New York for two years to study at the Neighborhood Playhouse, an acting conservatory in Manhattan. After she scored her first major role in an indie film, Drake Doremus\\u2019s \\u201cBreathe In\\u201d (2014), she traveled out west to Los Angeles in search of an agent and eventually settled there. She landed her breakout role in \\u201cHalt and Catch Fire\\u201d a few months later.\", \"\\u201cHalt,\\u201d lasting four seasons (2014-2017), was a steady part of Davis\\u2019s life for five years. Although the series never drew a big audience, it quietly gained a devoted following, aided in recent years by Netflix. Critics consistently praised it, placing the series on many major \\u201cBest Of\\u201d lists.\", \"Mackenzie \\u201ccan play intentions and emotions simultaneously that are usually diametrically opposed to each other,\\u201d Christopher Cantwell, a creator and showrunner of \\u201cHalt,\\u201d said in an email. \\u201cShe can play incredible anxiety and overconfidence all at once.\\u201d\", \"Davis\\u2019s career was gaining speed: Just after the third season of \\u201cHalt,\\u201d in 2016, she appeared in the \\u201cBlack Mirror\\u201d episode \\u201cSan Junipero\\u201d alongside Gugu Mbatha-Raw, an installment that won two Emmys. After \\u201cHalt,\\u201d Davis appeared in Denis Villeneuve\\u2019s \\u201cBlade Runner 2049\\u201d and then in Jason Reitman\\u2019s \\u201cTully\\u201d (2018) alongside Charlize Theron. She still seemed lightly stunned when she recalled that period.\", \"\\u201cDoing those two films back to back felt like \\u2014\\u201d she paused and shook her head slowly from side to side. \\u201cIt felt like: This is the work I want to be doing. I was working at a level that I had only fantasized about.\\u201d\", \"She considered her tacos, nestled close together in their paper box. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no way to do this neatly,\\u201d she said, \\u201cso I\\u2019m just going to dive in.\\u201d\", \"Her lead role in \\u201cStation\\u201d seemed like a natural next step, but 2020 put a halt to the momentum. Like most people, Davis faced her share of challenges. Her long-term relationship ended shortly before lockdown; production froze on \\u201cStation.\\u201d She entered quarantine alone \\u2014 a \\u201cstorm of isolation and loneliness,\\u201d as she described it. Eventually, she moved to London, in need of a fresh start.\", \"Then in January 2021, she went to work on \\u201cStation Eleven,\\u201d where each day demanded a thinly veiled re-enactment of tragedies of the previous year. She found herself wading through a sea of \\u201cdelayed\\u201d feelings.\", \"\\u201cSometimes I\\u2019d be walking around, and I\\u2019d think about a line in my head and just \\u2026 cry,\\u201d she said. She rolled her eyes.\", \"\\u201cThat is not at all the way I am as a person,\\u201d she continued. \\u201cI like to approach roles pretty rationally and logically, especially since you can\\u2019t count on an emotional response in my line of work.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBut for some reason \\u2014 I\\u2019m going to say it\\u2019s the pandemic! \\u2014 that feeling didn\\u2019t expire,\\u201d she added.\", \"In conversation, Davis is hyperfocused and sincere, jumping in with incisive questions or abstract ruminations. Cerebral without any coldness, she interrogates her own reactions almost as soon as she speaks them aloud.\", \"\\u201cShe challenges things in a really intelligent way,\\u201d Himesh Patel, who plays Jeevan, Kirsten\\u2019s caretaker after the pandemic hits, observed in a video call from his kitchen in London. \\u201cIt\\u2019s coming from a place of wanting it to be the best it can be. She\\u2019s fiercely intelligent.\\u201d\", \"The two actors began getting to know each other when Davis was a new arrival in London. On set in Toronto, they shared a cast tent, where Davis was constantly reading \\u2014 Mario Vargas Llosa\\u2019s \\u201cThe Bad Girl\\u201d one week and Michael Ondaatje\\u2019s \\u201cDivisadero\\u201d the next. Patel thought carefully when asked about his memories of that time.\", \"\\u201cIn a way, there was a feeling that we were carrying each other,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a weird time to be making something.\\u201d\", \"Davis\\u2019s character required her to navigate a multitude of identities: Kirsten is a member of the Traveling Symphony, an itinerant group of musicians and actors traversing the postpandemic landscape. Equally comfortable onstage (she\\u2019s the troupe\\u2019s Hamlet) or wielding a knife, Kirsten is at once a fiercely protective mother figure and a damaged young woman. She was 8 years old (played in an earlier timeline by Matilda Lawler) when the deadly flu hit, and \\u201cStation Eleven\\u201d spends much of its time digging into her memories, tying her actions in the present to the horrors of those early days. Davis\\u2019s eyes, limpid and expressive, flash from wariness to sorrow, then back.\", \"When Patrick Somerville, the series\\u2019s showrunner, and Hiro Murai, who directed Episodes 1 and 3, first approached Davis about playing Kirsten, she wasn\\u2019t sold. She had just wrapped her role in \\u201cTerminator,\\u201d and Kirsten seemed too similar. \\u201cI felt like I\\u2019d done that version of a strong female character \\u2014 the postapocalyptic bad bitch,\\u201d Davis recalled.\", \"But after talking with Somerville and Murai, she was persuaded. Kirsten seemed powerful in a different way. \\u201cViolence is a part of her world,\\u201d Davis explained, \\u201cbut it\\u2019s not the banner of her reality.\\u201d\", \"Instead, her strength lies in her emotional depth: She loves profoundly, and she has an intuitive sense for people\\u2019s feelings and intentions. The qualities that make Kirsten a good Shakespearean actor also help her survive a postpandemic landscape.\", \"In one of Davis\\u2019s strongest scenes, Hamlet, as played by Kirsten, grieves his father\\u2019s death, standing on a makeshift stage surrounded by flickering candles. Staring into the darkness, Kirsten\\u2019s mind shifts to her childhood, when she learned that her parents were dead. Davis\\u2019s face holds both moments in her character\\u2019s life at once, past and present.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s an impossible ocean of subtext\\u201d in those scenes, Somerville told me on a video call. \\u201cAfter the fact, I was constantly realizing that Mackenzie had played three looks in a row, invisibly. She was meticulously making bridges between moments, already doing the thing I hoped to build with the show\\u2019s nonlinear flashbacks.\\u201d\", \"The day after tacos, we met at a bustling all-day cafe in the West Village. Davis listened as our nervous server described the day\\u2019s specials, then thanked her warmly.\", \"When I asked Davis about her acting in those layered moments Somerville described, she leaned forward.\", \"\\u201cLike anybody else, I had a number of hugely upsetting events happen in the last two years,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThere was all of this ambiguous trauma that didn\\u2019t really have a home because everybody was feeling everything \\u2014 and where do you put trauma that is persistent and doesn\\u2019t begin or end but is just part of, like, a great, general sense of loss?\\u201d\", \"A little out of breath, she gave a crooked half-smile, as if amused by her own fervor, and sat back in her chair.\", \"\\u201cThen, suddenly,\\u201d she said, \\u201cI was telling a story within a house that could hold all of those feelings.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"425baa425ce911eca271637f2fd768d4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"425baa425ce911eca271637f2fd768d4"}},
