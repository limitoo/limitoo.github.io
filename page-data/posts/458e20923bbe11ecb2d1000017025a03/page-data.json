But I\\u2019m not typically out at 3:00 in the morning. In fact, our meeting was orchestrated by a publicist who, though not hired by him, admired his pluck. And that would unleash some uncomfortable questions about authenticity, ethics and opportunism.\", \"Beyond the fact that defacing property is illegal, Nullbureau, a first-time street artist from Seattle who would not give his real name for fear of arrest, wasn\\u2019t even painting his own ideas \\u2014 they were replications of the Shadowman figures of Richard Hambleton, a troubled under-known East Village painter who Nullbureau admired and who died in 2017. To cloud matters further, the replicator had the blessing of a collector and art entrepreneur (or \\u201cdisrupter\\u201d as he calls himself), Andrew Valmorbida, who said he gave Mr. Hambleton a million dollars for the copyright to all his works.\", \"For my article \\u201cThe Return of the Shadowman,\\u201d which recently ran in The New York Times\\u2019s Culture section, I set out to learn: Was this a homage, or a marketing ploy?\", \"I hit the streets with Nullbureau in the wee hours of a Saturday in September as he hunted for spots to transform. He\\u2019d been out every night for about a week and a half before I joined him, losing weight from all the walking \\u2014 and occasional running, when spotted. I watched him consider painting on the door of one of the many gyms that have taken over Manhattan, but a bar across the street had just closed and he could not risk getting seen by the crowd of smokers on the sidewalk. We walked on in search of another spot for him to darken with his mark, and he landed on a light-box ad for luxury real estate at a bus stop.\", \"Much of the story evolved as critique not praise. My editor, Barbara Graustark, suggested outside lawyers vet the copyright contract, and when I discovered that Mr. Valmorbida, who gave Nullbureau permission to copy Mr. Hambleton\\u2019s work, also had plans for an immersive (and potentially, sponsored) \\u201cShadowman experience\\u201d in London scheduled for 2022, I knew I didn\\u2019t want The Times to get played by promoting an art-world P.T. Barnum.\", \"So, I doubled down on getting responses from critical thinkers, street artists and friends of the late artist. One public art expert told me he\\u2019d as soon take his daughter to a Hambleton experience as a Chuck E. Cheese. Graffiti and street artists, who also risk arrest but without the backing of an entrepreneur and his publicist (the one who pitched me), expressed rage and resentment. Still, others found copying another\\u2019s haunting work contemptible and immoral. \\u201cTrading off on another artist\\u2019s core value,\\u201d one detractor told me.\", \"But then many, including those who knew Mr. Hambleton personally, cheered on Nullbureau for his guts and love of a late artist.\", \"Looking back, I have to admit I came to admire a conceptual obsessive who seemed more concerned with an artist he adored than with himself. Then there was the fact that all his hard work disappeared as fast as an Instagram story. (He uses watered-down latex paint that is washable.)\", \"As we walked, he told me how impressed he was with how New Yorkers seemed to engage in the city\\u2019s public spaces. He said that he knew he was doing something troubling, but hoped it would promote conversation. He assured me he wanted nothing to do with anything that would allow him to profit from his street paintings. \\u201cThese days any business can attach an artist to a brand to look cool,\\u201d he said.\", \"By 4 a.m. I could barely stand while I watched him paint. A young passer-by held a phone to record him, whispering \\u201camazing\\u201d over and over. I wanted to tell the young witness to put down the phone because this was an \\u201cin real life\\u201d moment.\", \"Too late. Nullbureau had packed his paint and brush into his backpack and was heading to a CitiBike station to ride uptown to keep painting. I wished him well.\", \"And I meant it. Copied or not, those shadowy figures made me look up and think.\"]","href_hash":"458e20923bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"458e20923bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}},
