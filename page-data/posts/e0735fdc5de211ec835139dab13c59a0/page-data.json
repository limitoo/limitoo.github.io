The Pennsylvania teen was in a room with his brother and other siblings when he fired his father's firearm at his brother, fatally shooting him.\", \"The teen is being charged as an adult because Pennsylvania law doesn't allow a teen to be charged with criminal homicide in juvenile court, according to the Allegheny County District Attorney's office. However, it plans to move the case to juvenile court and the teen is currently being held in a juvenile housing facility.\", \"Court records show he was also charged with being a minor in possession of a firearm.\", \"Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, police officers responded to the home around 5:30 p.m. on November 22 and found the 5-year-old on the bedroom floor, according to a criminal complaint obtained by Trib Live.
