The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.\", \"Actor and comedian Bob Saget (May 17, 1956-January 9, 2022) was studying film at the University of Southern California when he left college to pursue stand-up comedy. \\\"I never knew that I could do that until I got up the nerve to go on stage,\\\" he told the Norfolk (Va.) Daily Press in 1990. \\\"Look what trouble that's gotten me into.\\\"\", \"Small acting roles in \\\"Bosom Buddies,\\\" \\\"New Love, American Style\\\" and \\\"It's a Living\\\" led to his starring role in the sitcom \\\"Full House,\\\" playing a widower raising three daughters with the help of his best friend and his brother-in-law. The show (which costarred John Stamos, Davie Coulier, Candace Cameron Bure, Jodie Sweetin, and \\u2013 as the youngest child, Michelle \\u2013 twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) ran for eight seasons.\", \"He would play another widower in the sitcom \\\"Raising Dad,\\\" and returned to the Tanner household in the 2016 sequel series, \\\"Fuller House.\\\" Saget was also the narrator of the long-running CBS series, \\\"How I Met Your Mother.\\\"\", \"His charisma and wholesome humor were put to good use as the host of the family-friendly \\\"America's Funniest Home Videos\\\" for its first eight years. But his comedy could run much bluer, as in the 2005 documentary \\\"The Aristocrats,\\\" in which he contributed his take on the world's dirtiest joke. He had a cameo appearance as a cocaine addict in \\\"Half Baked,\\\" and in the comedy series \\\"Entourage,\\\" he was featured as a foul-mouthed, misogynistic character named \\u2026 Bob Saget.\", \"As Saget told \\\"CBS This Morning\\\" in 2017, his uncensored stand-up could come as a surprise to his TV fans: \\\"I was playing in Vancouver one night in a casino up there, and there was a lady that just started to walk. But for the most part I always adapt in a chameleon-like way to the audience. I don't purposely go, 'I'm gonna be crass here,' if they're not enjoying it, you know? I want to get laughs.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"He also directed several films, including the Norm MacDonald comedy \\\"Dirty Work,\\\" \\\"Benjamin,\\\" the mockumentary \\\"Farce of the Penguins,\\\" and the TV movie \\\"For Hope,\\\" a drama about a woman battling scleroderma, inspired by his late sister, Gay. In 2020, when the pandemic halted his planned comedy tour, he hosted a podcast, \\\"Bob Saget's Here For You,\\\" in which he answered fans' questions.\", \"In January, while in Florida on his \\\"I Don't Do Negative Comedy Tour,\\\" he tweeted, \\\"Loving beyond words being on tour \\u2026 I had no idea I did a 2 hr set tonight. I'm happily addicted again to this s***.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"dc825104722711ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dc825104722711ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
