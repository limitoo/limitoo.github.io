Invention of the cotton gin made possible cotton farming in the old Southwest, thus creating a demand for slaves to produce the cotton; the cotton gin was not invented until six years after the Constitution had been adopted.\", \"Richard Joffe New York\", \"\\u2666\", \"To the Editor:\", \" In reference to Hochschild\\u2019s review: Having encountered many people who, depending on their politics, either celebrated or condemned \\u201cThe 1619 Project\\u201d while barely familiar with it (let alone with the background information necessary to assess it), I find it refreshing to read an assessment by someone who actually knows what he is talking about.\", \"Felicia Nimue Ackerman Providence, R.I.\", \"To the Editor:\", \" James Yang\\u2019s \\u201cA Boy Named Isamu\\u201d (Nov. 14) is what excellent children\\u2019s literature is, the absence of the adult voice interfering in the telling of a story with the intent to teach a lesson or two. Children are surrounded by adult voices in life \\u2014 in \\u201cA Boy Named Isamu,\\u201d there are Isamu and the reader alone.\", \"This book will also be excellent for readers in their 80s and 90s as they, too, are surrounded by too many adult voices. What a pleasure of a stroll with Isamu, awakening our senses to our own world.\", \"Frances H. KakugawaSacramento\", \"To the Editor:\", \" Reviewing Mark Oppenheimer\\u2019s \\u201cSquirrel Hill: The Tree of Life Synagogue and the Soul of a Neighborhood\\u201d (Nov. 21), Irina Reyn mentions that the shooter was \\u201cparticularly incensed by Dor Hadash, a progressive congregation participating in the National Refugee Shabbat, an initiative organized by HIAS,\\u201d originally the Hebrew Immigration Aid Society.\", \"In his online rantings, the shooter, Robert Bowers, identified HIAS by name and singled them out for aiding the immigrants who were \\u201cflooding\\u201d into our country. Though Bowers voiced his dislike of Donald Trump, he expressed much of the same vitriol that the former president used. Large numbers of Pittsburgh residents informed the president that he was not wanted in their city because of his support of white nationalists and his anti-immigrant rhetoric. This was important to mention.\", \"Arthur Salz Kew Gardens, Queens\", \"To the Editor:\", \" I don\\u2019t think anything has dissolved my trust in contemporary writers so much as this business in the Book Review about night stands. You know, asking writers what books are on theirs in By the Book interviews.\", \"It\\u2019s not the books they name but the assumption that they have a night stand.\", \"I\\u2019m surprised so many give straight answers and don\\u2019t say something like: \\u201cDo you mean on top of the box of chocolates or under it?\\u201d Or: \\u201cIf I had books on the small table near my bed, they would crush the miniature stuffed wild boar.\\u201d\", \"Equally appalling is the cozy knowingness with which the Book Review assumes one has bought heaps of expensive books one might read and keeps them piled on that night stand.\", \"When I find a book, I want to read it like one of these passionate weekends in Venice you see in the movies. It\\u2019s all over in a few days. There\\u2019s no night stand.
