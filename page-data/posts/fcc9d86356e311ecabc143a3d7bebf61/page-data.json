Researchers said the SMNP adjuvant still has a ways to go before it could be implemented in future vaccines, but they are hoping the ingredient could eventually help a range of inoculations.\", \"\\\"This is super exciting,\\\" said LJI Professor Dr. Shane Crotty, a member of the LJI Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research. \\\"We're really hoping this adjuvant can help out.\\\"\", \"\\\"This has, potentially, a big impact for human health,\\\" he added.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946292/new-vaccine-ingredient-may-help-covid-shot.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Scientists found that a new vaccine ingredient may help COVID-19 vaccines and other inoculations become more successful at fighting disease.
