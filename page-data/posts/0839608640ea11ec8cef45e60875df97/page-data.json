Kathy Hochul and Senator Chuck Schumer while defending his love for Ferragamo loafers at a hotel bar under a giant banyan tree. He joyfully played a bongo drum and danced with performers at an event with union leaders. Members of the City Council jockeyed for photos with him at a dizzying series of parties with open bars and trays of empanadas and crab cakes.\", \"Mr. Adams soaked up the attention with a smile \\u2014 and more than a dash of bravado.\", \"\\u201cKeep analyzing me,\\u201d he told the crowd at one soiree. \\u201cDo what you want. But trust me when I tell you, there\\u2019s never going to be another mayor like me.\\u201d\", \"Hundreds of New York\\u2019s elected officials, lobbyists and labor leaders descend on San Juan each year for the Somos conference, to network and negotiate deals in a spring break-like atmosphere. Power brokers travel in packs, drink mojitos in beachwear, and make connections at poolside bars and after-hours receptions.\", \"And no one was in more demand than Mr. Adams, the self-declared \\u201cface of the new Democratic Party,\\u201d and the man who would soon control New York City, its army of more than 310,000 municipal workers and its $99 billion budget.\", \"Union leaders who felt blindsided by Mayor Bill de Blasio\\u2019s vaccine mandate are hoping for a better relationship with Mr. Adams. The roughly half-dozen City Council members running for speaker are eager for his stamp of approval. Allies are seeking prime spots in his administration. Lobbyists have a long list of priorities.\", \"And for the Democrats running for governor next year or weighing bids, Mr. Adams could be a powerful ally \\u2014 and whether or not he endorses, many want to attract parts of his political coalition.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s the most popular guy here,\\u201d said Eric A. Ulrich, an outgoing Republican city councilman and an Adams backer. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a rock star.\\u201d\", \"One of the leaders at a union breakfast that Mr. Adams attended on Saturday was Benny Boscio Jr., the head of the correctional officers union who has been at war with Mr. de Blasio over staffing issues at Rikers Island, and refused to get vaccinated until recently. Mr. Adams, the outgoing Brooklyn borough president, has named improving public safety and addressing the crisis at Rikers as two of his immediate priorities.\", \"Mr. Boscio said he had spoken to Mr. Adams at the conference, but declined to discuss any details. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve had good conversations here and in the past,\\u201d he said.\", \"Both his union and Mr. Adams rely on the same group of lobbyists and lawyers led by Vito R. Pitta, who was at the outdoor bar at the Fairmont El San Juan Hotel on Saturday talking to an attendee about jobs in the Adams administration.\", \"Henry Garrido, the leader of a major public workers union who sparred with Mr. de Blasio over the vaccine mandate, said he believed the new mayor would be more collaborative because, as a former police officer, Mr. Adams had been a city worker and a union member.\", \"\\u201cThey call him a blue-collar mayor \\u2014 I call him a union mayor,\\u201d Mr. Garrido said.\", \"Mr. de Blasio was also at the conference, although the clamor surrounding the current mayor was far less pronounced, even with his interest in running for governor in 2022. He laughed when asked about the pressures of being a newly elected mayor at Somos.\", \"\\u201cOh, my God, I mean, he\\u2019s getting every conceivable ask,\\u201d Mr. de Blasio said of Mr. Adams in a brief interview. \\u201cThere\\u2019s many officeseekers, many folks who want appointments. Imagine this: organizations that want funding! I think everybody and their kid brother is coming up to him with an ask, and he\\u2019s handling it very graciously and smartly.\\u201d\", \"Many Democrats at the conference were still grappling with Tuesday\\u2019s election results, in which a number of Democrats were wiped out on Long Island, Republicans made unexpected gains in the City Council, and Democratic candidates around the country lost or barely survived even in typically Democratic-leaning states. \", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t have our fingers on the pulse of everyday Democrats,\\u201d Mr. Adams said at a news conference, speaking broadly of the party. \\u201cDemocrats don\\u2019t want to disband police departments. They want police officers to do their job. Democrats are not against closing Rikers Island, but they also want to close the pipeline that feeds Rikers Island.\\u201d\", \"Still, Mr. Adams and many attendees were more often in a celebratory mood, taking stock of a City Council that will have a majority of women for the first time and embracing a sweeping infrastructure bill passed by the House late Friday. Around 9 p.m. Friday, shortly before the House vote, Mr. Schumer was at a party hosted by Dominican leaders showing off some unusual dance moves and shimmying with Carlina Rivera, one of the candidates for City Council speaker.\", \"Earlier in the day, Mr. Adams had insisted to reporters that he was \\u201cnot involved\\u201d in the speaker\\u2019s race and that it would be decided by the 51 members of the City Council, though nearly everyone at the event was debating whom he might support \\u2014 and there are ways, overtly or implicitly, that he or his allies may influence the process.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m just excited about the makeup of the Council \\u2014 young, energetic, with a lot of ideas,\\u201d Mr. Adams said, adding that \\u201cseasoned electeds\\u201d like Julie Menin, a veteran city commissioner and the city\\u2019s census director, and Gale A. Brewer, the Manhattan borough president who is joining the Council, would help guide the group.\", \"At an event with union leaders the next day in Lo\\u00edza, a township founded by formerly enslaved Africans, Mr. Adams vowed to fight \\u201csystemic inequalities\\u201d and compared himself to the abolitionists Harriet Tubman and Nat Turner.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m coming from the lineage of those who have always pushed back against the system,\\u201d he said.\", \"At a fund-raiser for the Brooklyn Democratic Party, Mr. Adams also defended himself from criticism that he was spending time with the city\\u2019s elite at the Manhattan nightclub Zero Bond.\", \"\\u201cYes, I like my Ferragamo, and yes, I do go to Zero Bond. But you know what? I also go to Sugar Hill on Nostrand Avenue,\\u201d he said in reference to a supper club in Brooklyn. \\u201cYes, I do hang out with the boys at night, but I get up with the men in the morning.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m an enigma to people who were born on third base,\\u201d he added.\", \"He visited several parties and gatherings that night, dipping in and out of hotel lobbies and receptions. At one point, the city\\u2019s first vegan mayor-elect found himself at the back of a private room at Ruth\\u2019s Chris Steak House standing in front of an incongruous backdrop: a glowing image of a steak.\", \"\\u201cIt was a setup!\\u201d Mr. Adams protested.\", \"Truer to form, Mr. Adams said he had grabbed some fruit and vegetables to keep his energy up.\", \"\\u201cThis way,\\u201d he declared, \\u201cI\\u2019m like the Energizer Bunny.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"0839608640ea11ec8cef45e60875df97"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0839608640ea11ec8cef45e60875df97"}},
