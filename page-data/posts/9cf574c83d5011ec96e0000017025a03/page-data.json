Yet, not for the first time in the director Ya\\u00ebl Farber\\u2019s career, Farber rules every minute of this attenuated account of the famously short work. \", \"Running nearly an hour longer than many \\u201cMacbeths,\\u201d the production conjoins sound, lighting and design to conjure a haunting mood that does more for the play than any individual\\u2019s performance. The menace and foreboding are palpable before the three witches have spoken a word.\", \"Where, then, does this leave Ronan, the superb Irish film actress and four-time Oscar nominee, in her British stage debut? She sometimes seems a decorative accessory to an exercise in total theater in which Tim Lutkin\\u2019s scalding lighting design, for instance, shines as bright as any Hollywood star.\", \"Yes, Ronan is given more to do than many Lady Macbeths, to foreground the actress most audience members have come to see. She\\u2019s there for the slaughter of Lady Macduff (Akiya Henry) and her children, which in turn reduces Ronan\\u2019s initially demure purveyor of evil to an anxious, hysterical wreck.\", \"But even as James McArdle in the title role builds to a vocal frenzy, we\\u2019re drawn to the hazily lit stage, which fills with water at the end, so the play\\u2019s combatants can splash about. (Those seated near the front might want to bring ponchos just in case.) \", \"Farber\\u2019s actors work hard, and often well, but they\\u2019re subsidiary to the atmosphere of gloom and dread she creates. That stays with you long after the thrill of celebrity has worn off.\", \"There\\u2019s never any doubting the intense stage presence of Cush Jumbo, the blazing talent known to TV audiences from \\u201cThe Good Fight\\u201d and \\u201cThe Good Wife\\u201d and who, unlike Ronan, cut her teeth in the theater. Some years back, she played Mark Antony in an all-female London production of \\u201cJulius Caesar\\u201d that was later seen in New York.\", \"Her return to the stage here as Hamlet, at the Young Vic through Nov. 13, constitutes an event. It\\u2019s just a shame that the director Greg Hersov\\u2019s modern-dress production doesn\\u2019t more frequently rise to the level of a star who is also the rare Black British actress to take this iconic role.\", \"Now and again, you sense inspiration. I liked the idea of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern as selfie-taking hipsters who try their best to engage with the prickly Danish prince. Tara Fitzgerald\\u2019s Gertrude is an emotionally reined-in fashionista who may never have had an honest emotion in her life \\u2014 until it\\u2019s too late.\", \"Elsewhere, Adrian Dunbar is a surprisingly dull Claudius; Joseph Marcell\\u2019s twinkly Polonius plays to the house, as if milking the character\\u2019s self-satisfaction for laughs. (His murder is bewilderingly staged to minimal impact, which seems odd given its importance as an early indicator of Hamlet\\u2019s building rage.)\", \"Throughout an unevenly paced evening, the androgynous Jumbo sets Hamlet apart as surely the smartest person in the room, and also the most furious. \\u201cTo be or not to be?\\u201d feels less like an existential rumination than like the angry outburst of someone who\\u2019s had enough. \", \"I\\u2019ve seen more moving Hamlets, yet Jumbo fully catches the edgy restlessness of a protean character. Purring \\u201cthis likes me well\\u201d of the knife he will use in combat, Jumbo\\u2019s Hamlet separately refers to \\u201cthe very witching time of night.\\u201d This got me thinking: If Jumbo is looking for more Shakespearean roles, as I hope she is, what about having a go at Macbeth or his lady \\u2014 or both?\", \"It\\u2019s not long ago that I caught another unusual choice for Hamlet in the age-inappropriate Ian McKellen. At 82, the acting veteran is still onstage in Britain, this time in the starry company of Francesca Annis and Martin Shaw in \\u201cThe Cherry Orchard.\\u201d This Chekhov revival, directed, as was McKellen\\u2019s \\u201cHamlet,\\u201d by his longtime friend and colleague Sean Mathias, is on view through Nov. 13 in the riverside town of Windsor, and is worth the trip.\", \"Unlike the two Shakespeares, Chekhov\\u2019s 1904 play is kept in period and brings to mind the name-heavy productions of the classics that used to be mainstays of the West End but aren\\u2019t so much anymore. In a vital new adaptation by the American playwright Martin Sherman (\\u201cBent\\u201d), this \\u201cCherry Orchard\\u201d even indulges in a little gender-bending, with the eccentric uncle, Gaev, played by a tearful Jenny Seagrove \\u2014 last seen as Gertrude to McKellen\\u2019s Hamlet.\", \"The focus of the play remains Madame Ranevskaya, the financially heedless aristocrat newly returned from Paris to the ancestral Russian estate that will soon be sold out from under her. Annis, a onetime Juliet to McKellen\\u2019s Romeo, is perfectly cast in a role that capitalizes on her natural elegance and luxuriant voice. Shaw, too, is in terrific form as the wealthy Lopakhin, the peasant\\u2019s son made good whose warnings about the fate of the orchard go unheeded.\", \"Shuffling about with a cane, a long beard tumbling from his chin, McKellen seizes the role of the aging manservant, Firs, without stealing focus from his colleagues. \\u201cI\\u2019ve lived a long time,\\u201d Firs says at one point, to an appreciative chuckle from the audience.\", \"Like Hamlet, McKellen knows the play\\u2019s the thing. Sometimes a classic text, simply and clearly told, is all you want, or need.\", \"\"]","href_hash":"9cf574c83d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9cf574c83d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}},
