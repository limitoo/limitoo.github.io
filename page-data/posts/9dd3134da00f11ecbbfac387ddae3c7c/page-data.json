the second is the medications that will treat the disease, and that research is underway.\", \"Right now, about 70,000 New Zealanders have dementia, but our population is ageing and that number's expected to mushroom to 170,000 within the next 30 years.\", \"Health experts have warned that will put an unbearable amount of pressure on our health system, costing nearly $6 billion a year.\", \"Alzheimer's New Zealand chief executive Catherine Hall said more research on the disease is vital.\", \"\\\"The amount of money spent on research about dementia in New Zealand is woefully inadequate,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"And that's a real problem because there are a lot of people affected by dementia -
