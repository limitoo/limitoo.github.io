So Mr. Vela-Fonseca, 28, took out his camera and started shooting.\", \"For days afterward, he and a handful of other people captured remarkable images of a river of fire snaking for miles in an orange line so bright it was visible from space.\", \"\\u201cOther cultures see volcanoes as gods and the wrath of nature speaking to us,\\u201d Mr. Vela-Fonseca, who is from the Gal\\u00e1pagos, said by telephone.\", \"\\u201cBut we don\\u2019t fear them, that\\u2019s for sure,\\u201d he added. \\u201cOurs aren\\u2019t explosive or violent. They\\u2019re very, very gentle, and they last for a long time. It\\u2019s just mesmerizing to see.\\u201d\", \"Some volcanic eruptions are notable for their sheer force. The recent one off the coast of Tonga, for example, produced hundreds of times the mechanical energy created when the United States military leveled Hiroshima, Japan, with an atomic bomb in August 1945, according to a NASA analysis.\", \"Such volcanoes produce explosive ash clouds when gas bubbles become pressurized because they cannot escape from sticky magmas beneath the ground, said Michael Stock, a professor of geochemistry at the University of Dublin in Ireland.\", \"\\u201cThe magmas erupted on Wolf Volcano do not contain very much gas, but they\\u2019re also very hot and runny, which allows any gas bubbles which are present to easily escape,\\u201d Professor Stock said. \\u201cFor this reason, the system doesn\\u2019t become pressurized and consistently produces relatively benign lava flows.\\u201d\", \"The Wolf eruption was visually spectacular in part because it happened on a moonless night and more than 60 miles from the nearest human settlement, according to Jorge Carri\\u00f3n and Washington Tapia Aguilera, two scientists with the Gal\\u00e1pagos Conservancy, a nonprofit based in Virginia. Mr. Carri\\u00f3n captured the early stages of the eruption in a time-lapse video that he shot from near the top of the roughly 5,580-foot volcano.\", \"Wolf Volcano is the largest and tallest volcano in the Gal\\u00e1pagos Islands, an archipelago about 600 miles west of continental Ecuador. A nearby volcano on the same island, Isabela, is named after Charles Darwin, who came up with his theory of evolution after studying finches on the archipelago in the 1830s.\", \"When Wolf erupted after 11 p.m. on Jan. 6, Mr. Vela-Fonseca and others were in the area as part of a naturalist expedition organized by Cookson Adventures, a London-based travel company founded by the polar explorer Henry Cookson.\", \"After the eruption, the expedition became a mission to rescue park rangers and scientists, including Mr. Carri\\u00f3n, who had been conducting fieldwork on the volcano. At first light on Jan. 7, Cookson Adventures organized two helicopters to fly them to safety.\", \"The passengers on those helicopters had an up-close view of molten lava as it crept down the volcano\\u2019s southeastern flank. Mr. Cookson said in an email that at some points, lava was being thrown up to 200 feet in the air.\", \"\\u201cThe pilots weren\\u2019t very comfortable,\\u201d said Mr. Vela-Fonseca, who was on a support ship that the helicopters used as a staging ground for flights over the lava. No one was killed or injured as a result of the eruption.\", \"In the days after those helicopter flights, Cookson Adventures arranged to fly Gustavo Miranda, Ecuador\\u2019s environment minister, into the area so that he could assess the risk to biodiversity. A primary concern was the pink iguana, a species that lives on Wolf Volcano and was seen for the first time only in 1986. Scientists say there were only about 200 breeding adults in existence today.\", \"Fortunately, the eruption had occurred on the opposite side of the volcano from where pink iguanas and other endemic species, including giant tortoises, mainly live.\", \"Once the lava flows cool, they will aid the evolutionary patterns of Gal\\u00e1pagos biodiversity by hosting seeds, insects, small reptiles and birds, Mr. Carri\\u00f3n and Mr. Tapia Aguilera said in an email.\", \"\\u201cLife never stops,\\u201d they wrote.\", \"But the lava hasn\\u2019t quite cooled yet. Fresh lava was still flowing from Wolf Volcano as of last week, according to Mr. Vela-Fonseca and Anahi Concari, a naturalist guide from the Gal\\u00e1pagos who has been visiting the area in recent days.\", \"The Geophysical Institute, a research organization in Ecuador, said last month that Wolf Volcano\\u2019s \\u201ceruptive activity\\u201d was decreasing. It also said that Wolf may yet spring back to life \\u2014 just as it did during its last eruptive phase, in May and June of 2015.\", \"Mr. Vela-Fonseca said that he planned to visit Wolf\\u2019s lava flows again on Monday.\", \"Residents of the Gal\\u00e1pagos tend to welcome eruptions because they draw attention to a place where nature tourism drives the economy, he said, and the archipelago\\u2019s black-and-red volcanic deposits are constant reminders of how it was formed in the first place\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s all over the place,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe see fields of lava everywhere.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"af50eba289ef11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"af50eba289ef11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
