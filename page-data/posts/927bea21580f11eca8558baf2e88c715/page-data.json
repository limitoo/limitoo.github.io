After all, much of its current leadership refuses to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election and is dead set on undermining the concept of one person, one vote.\", \"If it does pose such a threat, does that leave the Democratic Party as the main institutional defender of democracy?\", \"If the Democratic Party has been thrust into that role \\u2014 whether it wants it or not \\u2014 recent election results and adverse polling trends suggest that it stands a good chance of losing both branches of Congress in 2022 and that Trump or a Trump clone could win the presidency in 2024.\", \"The issue then becomes a question of strategic emphasis. Do Democratic difficulties grow more out of structural advantages of the Republican Party \\u2014 better geographic distribution of its voters, the small-state tilt of the Electoral College and the Senate, more control over redistricting? Or do their difficulties stem from Democratic policies and positions that alienate key blocs of the electorate?\", \"If, as much evidence shows, working class defections from the Democratic Party are driven more by cultural, racial, and gender issues than by economics \\u2014 many non-college whites are in fact supportive of universal redistribution programs and increased taxes on the rich and corporations \\u2014 should the Democratic Party do what it can to minimize those sociocultural points of dispute, or should the party stand firm on policies promoted by its progressive wing?\", \"I asked a group of scholars and Democratic strategists versions of these questions.\", \"Three conclusions stood out.\", \"There was near unanimous agreement that the Republican Party under the leadership of Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, but disagreement over the degree of the danger.\", \"There was across the board opposition to the creation of a third party on the grounds that it would split the center and the left.\", \"In addition, a striking difference emerged when it came to the choice of strategic responses to the threat, between those who emphasize the built-in structural advantages benefiting the Republican Party and those who contend that Democrats should stand down on some of the more divisive cultural issues in order to regain support among working class voters, white, Black and Hispanic.\", \"Theda Skocpol, a professor of sociology and government at Harvard, argued in an email that\", \"Skocpol\\u2019s point:\", \"Because the Democratic Party is structurally weakened by the rural tilt of the Senate and the Electoral College \\u2014 and especially vulnerable to gerrymandered districts because its voters are disproportionately concentrated in metro areas \\u2014 the party \\u201cmay not have enough elected power to accomplish basic voter and election protection reforms.
