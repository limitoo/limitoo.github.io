A few years later with his brother Brian, he had better luck, sort of \\u2014 feasting on hot dogs at Nathan\\u2019s Famous, then boarding what he recalled as a tame-looking \\u201cwhirly\\u201d ride.\", \"\\u201cAs we got on, I said something like, \\u2018I think this is for kids,\\u2019\\u201d Gleeson, 38, said late last week at St. Ann\\u2019s Warehouse in Dumbo, a sleeker corner of Brooklyn than the setting of his tale. \\u201cMy strong belief is that the person running that machine heard me, because it spun us in three different directions for like an hour and a half, and I\\u2019ve never been so sick in my life.\\u201d\", \"Ridiculously entertaining, thoroughly self-deprecating, his anecdote also involved a ride on the old wooden roller coaster (\\u201clike being put in a paint shaker\\u201d) and his younger brother\\u2019s far sturdier constitution. But Gleeson was only telling it because I asked if he\\u2019d ever been there.\", \"\\u201cHow dare you bring up traumatic pasts,\\u201d he joked, \\u201cwhen I\\u2019m doing a play like this?\\u201d\", \"In Enda Walsh\\u2019s \\u201cMedicine,\\u201d running through Dec. 12 at St. Ann\\u2019s, and streaming live Nov. 28 and Dec. 5, Gleeson plays John Kane, a psychiatric inpatient whose apparent drama therapy session with two visiting actors and a drummer trawls through traumatic episodes from his life. Absurdism abounds.\", \"It is not, then, the safe fare you might expect from an actor known for playing General Hux in the \\u201cStar Wars\\u201d franchise, Tim in the time-travel rom-com \\u201cAbout Time\\u201d and Bill Weasley in the \\u201cHarry Potter\\u201d films \\u2014 in which his father, Brendan Gleeson, played the gruff, good-guy wizard Mad-Eye Moody. Domhnall (rhymes with \\u201ctonal\\u201d) has also been seen recently opposite Merritt Wever in the HBO drama \\u201cRun,\\u201d and with his brother Brian in the Amazon comedy \\u201cFrank of Ireland,\\u201d which they spent part of the pandemic making.\", \"He proved his stage chops in New York before any of that, though, making his Tony-nominated Broadway debut at 22 in Martin McDonagh\\u2019s \\u201cThe Lieutenant of Inishmore,\\u201d in 2006. His affinity for Walsh\\u2019s work has history, too; in 2015, at his instigation, he, Brian and their father starred in a Dublin revival of Walsh\\u2019s 2006 play \\u201cThe Walworth Farce.\\u201d\", \"But Walsh wrote \\u201cMedicine\\u201d for Gleeson and the rest of its cast: Clare Barrett, Aoife Duffin and Sean Carpio. In the script, John describes himself as \\u201ca tall ginger man,\\u201d which Gleeson, at 6 foot 1, very much is. \\u201cAnd pale, too,\\u201d John adds, which is also true.\", \"Drinking Throat Coat tea and bottled water to preserve his voice, Gleeson was cautiously game as he talked about his life and Walsh\\u2019s work, hyperaware of the danger of saying the wrong thing or seeming arrogant. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.\", \"Tell me about you and Enda Walsh\\u2019s plays. What is it about them?\", \"I really didn\\u2019t understand Enda fully, I don\\u2019t think, or get the full dose of him until I saw \\u201cThe Walworth Farce.\\u201d Which I saw in a tiny room in Galway. It blew my head off in a way that was totally new. I was shocked to my core by it.\", \"It\\u2019s a father and two sons, and he forces them to put on this farce every day. And what we\\u2019re watching is one day when the farce breaks down. They\\u2019ve been doing it for like 15 years, 20 years, this farce, and this other person arrives into their midst, and things just go off the rails. I left like, shook, really shook. I\\u2019d laughed so much, but I\\u2019d also never fully cried \\u2014 like fully just wept, twice.\", \"In a theater, you hadn\\u2019t ever fully cried before?\", \"No. I\\u2019d been moved to tears, maybe, but not like this. Not mouth agog and tears just going as you were still engaged. And I was like, I don\\u2019t know what this is. Enda makes me react in a way that I don\\u2019t understand, and I just love that about him.\", \"When people ask what \\u201cMedicine\\u201d is about, what do you tell them?\", \"It\\u2019s a play partly about how we treat those that we describe as mentally ill. And the role of empathy in that and the role of medicine, good and bad, in that, and the importance of care, you know, and love. I think that\\u2019s at its core what it\\u2019s about. But it certainly doesn\\u2019t let you know that up front.\", \"I mean, the lobster costume is a distraction.\", \"[Laughs] Yeah, I know.\", \"Your character, John, dreams of being invisible. Are you able to go out and be a regular person around here, anonymous on the street?\", \"There are days where you feel much more anonymous, in a nice way. I\\u2019m living close to the theater, so just getting to see the skyline and feel New York and all the rest of it, it\\u2019s amazing. Being able to walk around and feel like you just disappear into the fabric of that is gorgeous. I love that. It makes me feel very young and reminds me of when I was back here when I was 22. I just love soaking up that energy, and I love the cold air. And then other days you do feel a little bit like, \\u201cOh, no,\\u201d conscious that maybe people have recognized you.\", \"When you played Bill Weasley, you\\u2019re the one who said, \\u201cMad-Eye\\u2019s dead.\\u201d How was that?\", \"I think I would feel differently about it now. At the time, I would have maybe lost one grandparent \\u2014 who I love very deeply. But I was in my mid-, late 20s maybe? I was like, this is a hilarious thing to announce in a big movie. I probably wouldn\\u2019t find it so \\u2014 maybe I would still find it funny now. I think my dad would find it funny, so yeah.\", \"What does theater do for you that film and TV don\\u2019t? If anything.\", \"Oh, no, it does. What happens in the theater, the live connection is what\\u2019s paramount. That crackle when the work is good, there\\u2019s nothing like it. That feeling in the air, and with somebody like Enda, a sense of threat, of possibility \\u2014 possibility of hilarity, of huge sadness, huge anger, chaos breaking out. It feels like it\\u2019s spilling out of control.\", \"I read something about you scheduling other projects around \\u201cMedicine,\\u201d that it\\u2019s been a priority for you.\", \"It\\u2019s just that I believe you only live once, right? I had the opportunity to do this thing that, in my life, I want to have done. Because Enda means so much to me, the notion of being in the first version of one of his plays, the fact that he wrote it for us, I mean, God. Of course.\", \"You don\\u2019t know when you\\u2019re going to get sick, you don\\u2019t know when you\\u2019re not going to be able to do things. You don\\u2019t know when the work will dry up. You don\\u2019t know when people will decide they\\u2019re not interested in you expressing yourself anymore. That all can happen really fast. If there\\u2019s something you want to do, then do it now.\", \"I would also say backing out on theater at the moment would be bad form. Theater needs people to back it. Theater needs actors to do it. Crew to do it. And right now, more than ever, it needs audiences to turn up. There are many places on a knife edge. If you care about it or if you think it might be interesting, then now\\u2019s the time. Go.\"]","href_hash":"959a71224d7411ec8b6cd5349cb7bc8b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"959a71224d7411ec8b6cd5349cb7bc8b"}},
