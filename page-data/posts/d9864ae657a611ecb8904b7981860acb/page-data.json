Biden has tasked himself with protecting Ukraine, a democratic ally whose security U.S. officials have promised to defend.\", \"Jake Sullivan, the president\\u2019s national security adviser, declined to go into detail about the consequences facing Russia.\", \"\\u201cI will look you in the eye and tell you as President Biden looked President Putin in the eye and told him today that things we did not do in 2014, we are prepared to do now,\\u201d Sullivan said. In 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine\\u2019s Crimean Peninsula.\", \"On the ground: Ukrainian soldiers have seen little evidence of escalation, but after eight years in the trenches, they wearily anticipate that the Russian military will come sooner or later.\", \"Related: U.S. officials told Congress that Germany had agreed to shut down its gas pipeline that runs through Russia if Putin\\u2019s troops invade Ukraine, according to Reuters. \", \"Amid rising fears of the Omicron coronavirus variant and criticism of Western vaccine hoarding, the U.S. announced a plan to spend $400 million to deliver vaccines globally and help \\u201covercome vaccine access barriers.\\u201d\", \"The proposed spending is an important step, public health experts said, for both poor countries and wealthy countries.

Alotaibi, who would probably be extradited to Turkey if his identity was confirmed, would be the first of the murder suspects to be tried in person outside Saudi Arabia.\", \"Context: In February, President Biden allowed the release of a report that concluded that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia had approved the plan to capture or kill Khashoggi.
