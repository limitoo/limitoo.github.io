As more states move to legalize marijuana, most people say they wouldn't mind if a licensed marijuana business opened in their neighborhood.\\u00a0\", \"Recreational marijuana use remains illegal at the federal level.\\u00a0 The House of Representatives recently passed a bill to federally decriminalize marijuana.\\u00a0\", \"Nearly all who support legalization under state law, also support it under federal law, and vice versa. In fact legal recreational marijuana gets the same level of support whether the question is posed about the state level or federal level, suggesting the jurisdiction may not matter much to people.\\u00a0\", \"The legalization of recreational pot use in more states has sparked the opening of more legal marijuana businesses, and most Americans wouldn't mind this kind of business opening in their neighborhood: most either would favor it or say it wouldn't matter much to them. \\u00a0\", \"Just three in 10 would oppose the opening of a licensed recreational marijuana business in their area.\\u00a0 Opposition is largely driven by those who are against making marijuana use legal in the first place.\\u00a0\", \"Marijuana users (37% of Americans say they use it) are more supportive of legalization and of recreational marijuana businesses opening in their neighborhood, and support is even higher among those who use marijuana regularly.\", \"Among those who say they never use marijuana, a slim majority favor legalization, but they are comparatively\\u00a0 less supportive than those who use.

However, younger Americans (who are more likely to use marijuana) remain more supportive of legal pot than older Americans.\", \"Political and ideological leanings do shape views. Most Democrats, liberals, independents and moderates favor legalization under federal law, but Republicans and conservatives are split on the issue.
