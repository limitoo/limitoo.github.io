Yellen said on Tuesday that she still supported an embattled proposal that would require banks to turn over additional information about their customers\\u2019 accounts to the Internal Revenue Service, arguing that the proposal would help ensure that the wealthy were not dodging taxes.\", \"The bank reporting idea had been central to the Biden administration\\u2019s plan to shrink the $7 trillion \\u201ctax gap\\u201d \\u2014 the shortfall in taxes that are owed but not collected \\u2014 and help pay for the $2.2 trillion social policy and climate legislation that Democrats are trying to pass this year. After fierce backlash from banks and Republicans, who derided the idea as an invasion of privacy, it was dropped from the bill that House Democrats passed this month.\", \"The Biden administration has been hoping that a more modest version of the proposal could make it into the Senate\\u2019s version of the bill. Ms. Yellen said she still backed the concept of having banks share data for accounts with total annual deposits or withdrawals of more than $10,000, with exceptions for wage earners or people who receive federal benefits like Social Security.\", \"\\u201cI do support it,\\u201d Ms. Yellen said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s important that the I.R.S. have visibility into opaque income streams and that\\u2019s an important way of improving tax compliance.\\u201d\", \"Republicans insisted that the I.R.S. could not be trusted with additional data because of recent leaks of taxpayer information and the agency\\u2019s history of targeting political groups.\", \"\\u201cCertainly my constituents can\\u2019t condone this aspect of the Build Back Better plan that would give even more authority and a tenfold increase in the budget to snoop on more Americans, audit more Americans and invade our privacy,\\u201d Senator Bill Hagerty, Republican of Tennessee, said.\", \"Ms. Yellen said the plan was not an attempt to \\u201csnoop\\u201d on taxpayers or collect detailed information about their banking activity.\", \"\\u201cThe burden on financial institutions was minimal, and there was no attempt to target income earners whose actual incomes are below $400,000,\\u201d Ms. Yellen said.\", \"Although the chances of the bank reporting requirement making it into the final legislation appear slim, Democrats are counting on an investment of $80 billion to expand the enforcement capacity of the I.R.S. to generate $400 billion of additional tax revenue over a decade. That estimate, which is more optimistic than the projections of the Congressional Budget Office, allows the Biden administration to claim that the new spending will not add to the national debt.\", \"\\u201cThese are very important resources that are needed to make sure that the wealthiest individuals, and corporations particularly, comply with the tax laws and pay their fair share, what\\u2019s due,\\u201d Ms. Yellen said.\"]","href_hash":"cab03086521511eca6af111de331012f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cab03086521511eca6af111de331012f"}},
