While they do have some against the Delta (strain),\\\" Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba, told reporters.\", \"\\\"The good news is that with the booster dose it increases about a hundred fold. There is a significant protection of the booster dose. It is lower than the neutralization ability against the Delta, about four times lower,\\\" she said.\", \"The Israeli team said they worked with the actual virus while the companies used what is known as a pseudovirus, which was bio-engineered to have the hallmark mutations of Omicron.\", \"The Israeli research follows a study from South Africa that found the Omicron variant can partially evade protection from two doses.\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"6d24a8c35e5211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6d24a8c35e5211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
