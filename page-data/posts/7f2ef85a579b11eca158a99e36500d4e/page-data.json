A 2019 entry on American University\\u2019s website says, \\u201cA more diverse university community opens all students up to a broader range of perspectives, helping them become better problem solvers and introducing them to new ways of thinking.\\u201d A 2015 report by Harvard University\\u2019s College Working Group on Diversity and Inclusion reads:\", \"But we\\u2019re also reminded, at intervals, that students of color sometimes consider it offensive when they\\u2019re expected to represent the \\u201cdiverse\\u201d point of view in classes or interactions with their classmates. In 2007, one Harvard Crimson columnist chafed at \\u201cBeing the token black person,\\u201d writing, \\u201cI am expected to be an authority on the lives of all black people.\\u201d Earlier this year, a PopSugar article surveyed the challenges faced by Black students at predominantly white institutions, or PWIs (the terminological analog to historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs), including \\u201ca myriad of microaggressions that are exhausting to deal with\\u201d and carrying \\u201cthe burden of representation when it comes to speaking about things from a historical context,\\u201d which is \\u201cexacerbated when they are the only Black student in their class.\\u201d\", \"It can be hard to know where to go on that if diversity is a key component of a well-rounded education but an indefensible burden on the very people representing the diversity.\", \"Another example: Sometimes Black television writers object \\u2014 justifiably \\u2014 to being ignored when white writers have Black characters doing and saying things that would be unrealistic coming from actual Black people living in a racist America. On a 1994 episode of the Black sitcom \\u201cFamily Matters,\\u201d when the family\\u2019s teenage son comes home after being harassed by a white police officer, his father, a cop himself, asks him if he did anything to provoke the officer\\u2019s harassment. \\u201cAre you absolutely sure?\\u201d Sgt. Winslow (Reginald VelJohnson) asks his son, Edward (Darius McCrary). As The Atlantic\\u2019s Hannah Giorgis reported in September, Felicia Henderson, a Black woman who was then a writer on the show, recounted telling her white colleagues that no Black father, and especially not one who was a police officer, would have had that as a first response to his son\\u2019s version of events. Despite her skepticism, that line stayed in.\", \"But then, Black writers object when white writers in similar situations ask them whether something a Black character is written as saying or doing is correct. Henderson told Giorgis that when she worked on \\u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\\u201d:\", \"The idea, again, is that there\\u2019s something offensive about a Black person being asked to arbitrate the Black view on a given issue \\u2014 but what if white writers don\\u2019t ask? Isn\\u2019t their asking what we were hoping for?\", \"There is a contradiction here, and it isn\\u2019t resolved simply by pointing out the obvious truth that there is a wide range of experience and perspective within Black America \\u2014 that Blackness is complex. Because if Blackness is so complex that no individual should be asked to represent it, then on what grounds did Black writers object back in the day? If we concur with the earlier grievance, how do we make sense of the new one? And what is a presumably well-meaning white colleague supposed to do? Use their own judgment or ask for their Black colleague\\u2019s input and run the risk of pigeonholing them or, if you prefer, essentializing them?\", \"These paradoxes make contemporary discussions about race that much harder to sort. Certainly, there have always been different schools of thought on how to address issues of race. Think of the ideological rivalry between W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington. Washington stressed education \\u2014 academic and vocational \\u2014 and entrepreneurship as keys to Black uplift. Du Bois emphasized political mobilization and a broader condemnation of societal racism. But Washington wasn\\u2019t opposed to condemning racism, and Du Bois was hardly opposed to education and entrepreneurship. In any case, in their time, America wasn\\u2019t being asked to adopt the notion that the prescriptions of one of these men canceled out those of the other.\", \"There\\u2019s something counterproductive about the way contemporary race matters are caveated and couched in questions that so often lead to more questions, rather than to consensus. Often, today\\u2019s conversations seem motivated by identifying the element of racism in as many situations as possible. And too many times, this results in M\\u00f6bius-strip discussions that go nowhere and help no one.\", \"I prefer objections that aren\\u2019t canceled out by other ones: If you ask me, there is a definable Blackness, a Black culture, which, porous though its boundaries may be, is amenable to representation by the opinions of a single Black writer in a writers\\u2019 pool. That writer may quite well be able to elucidate more than one Black perspective rather than just their own and assess which of those perspectives is best observed in a particular context.\", \"I\\u2019m guessing that some will think I\\u2019m oversimplifying. But my response is to ask: Are race issues so tangled that we can\\u2019t straightforwardly point ourselves toward some measure of general agreement \\u2014 or even just peace? Are we dealing with complexity or just a kind of synthetic confusion? Confusion in race politics that \\u2014 whatever it yields \\u2014 is a new rather than classic version of The Struggle.\"]","href_hash":"7f2ef85a579b11eca158a99e36500d4e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7f2ef85a579b11eca158a99e36500d4e"}},
