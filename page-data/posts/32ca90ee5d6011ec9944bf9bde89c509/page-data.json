The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a human rights group, was one of nearly 250 organizations and individuals named as co-conspirators.\", \"The federal government at the time said it had included the organizations on the list to extract evidence for the trial, but the district court and a federal appeals court ruled that making the list public was a mistake. A decade later, the council, which is modeled on the Anti-Defamation League, honored Ms. Omar, who gave a speech to its California chapter.\", \"None of that information was imparted by Mr. Perry. Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and an ally of Ms. Omar, moved immediately to strike Mr. Perry\\u2019s words from the official record of the debate, grinding the House floor to a halt. Ultimately, Mr. Perry was barred from speaking again Tuesday night. \", \"The kerfuffle showed the gulf between the two parties, even as House Democratic leaders are trying to defuse the incendiary issue of bigotry. The anti-Muslim bias bill came to the floor four weeks after a video surfaced of Representative Lauren Boebert, Republican of Colorado, suggesting that Ms. Omar could have been a suicide bomber and calling her a member of the \\u201cjihad squad.\\u201d\", \"Several Democrats wanted their leaders to punish Ms. Boebert by stripping her of her committee assignments, but leaders opted not to. They had already done that to two other Republicans this year, Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said that further action could be taken against Ms. Boebert.\", \"Ms. Pelosi said Tuesday night that she had hoped the House would \\u201ccome together in a spirit of unity\\u201d on the anti-Islamophobia bill. Instead, she said, what followed was \\u201can attack on the faith of one of our members.\\u201d\", \"House Republican leaders denounced the bill, saying it would create what they called a redundant office within the State Department, and because \\u201cIslamophobia\\u201d was not clearly defined, they raised the prospect that such a new office could be used to police Israel\\u2019s efforts to counter Islamist organizations like Hamas.\", \"Representative Andy Barr, Republican of Kentucky, called it \\u201ca wolf in sheep\\u2019s clothing.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"32ca90ee5d6011ec9944bf9bde89c509"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"32ca90ee5d6011ec9944bf9bde89c509"}},
