LEAVE NOW!\\\"\", \"Within hours, the blaze had swept an estimated 1600 acres (647.5 hectares) and destroyed more than 500 homes, Pelle told reporters at a news briefing.\", \"He said an entire subdivision of 370 homes went up in flames west of Superior, and that 210 dwellings were lost in the Old Town area of Superior, along with additional residences in the area. Property losses also included a shopping centre and hotel in Superior, officials said.\", \"Governor Jared Polis said flames were consuming football fields of landscape in a matter of seconds, calling the conflagration \\\"a force of nature\\\".\", \"The sheriff said gale-force winds made it impossible to halt the fire's rapid advance, adding that fire and emergency personnel were \\\"essentially running ahead of this just trying to get people out of the way. That's all you can do.\\\"\", \"Pelle said tens of thousands of area residents were under evacuation orders.\", \"Among the evacuees were a number of patients from Avista Adventist Hospital in Louisville who were deemed especially vulnerable to smoke-inhalation, Kevin Massey, a spokesperson for healthcare network Centura Health, told Reuters.\", \"\\\"We are transferring some ICU and neonatal patients as it's safe to do so,\\\" he said.\", \"The sheriff said he had no reports of people missing and no deaths reported.\", \"Six people were treated for injuries from the wildfires at the UCHealth hospital in the neighbouring city of Broomfield, spokesperson Kelli Christensen said. But she declined to specify the nature of the injuries or the patients' conditions.\", \"The extent of property losses was not immediately known, but KMGH-TV, the local ABC News affiliate, aired footage of multiple homes engulfed in flames.\", \"A towering plume of smoke from the wildfire was visible in Denver, about 20 miles (32 kilometres) to the south.\", \"Wind gusts of up to 110 miles (177 km) per hour were reported in Boulder, according to the National Weather Service, which said fast-moving fires were creating a \\\"life-threatening situation\\\" in the Superior and Louisville areas.\", \"Authorities said forecasts called for diminishing winds late on Thursday or early on Friday, which would enable firefighters to get ahead of the flames and for water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers to be deployed against the blaze.\", \"Polis declared a state of emergency allowing use of disaster funding to support emergency response efforts in Boulder County and to allow mobilization of the Colorado National Guard and other state resources as needed.\", \"The fire on the outskirts of the Denver metropolitan area, left bone dry from an extreme drought gripping eastern Colorado, follows several days of heavy snow in the Rocky Mountains to the west. However, forecasts call for snow to hit Denver and eastern Colorado starting on Friday.\", \"-Reuters \"]","href_hash":"629190cc69f211ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"629190cc69f211ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
