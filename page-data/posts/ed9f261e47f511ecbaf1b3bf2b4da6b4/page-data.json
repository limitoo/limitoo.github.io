The family decided to reach out to Aviation Haven for assistance.\", \"The roadrunner may have been able to survive the journey thanks to a rainy drive.\", \"Winn said she understood there may have been a leak somewhere in the truck.\", \"\\\"There was water dripping into the van and it collected on a piece of furniture, so there was a drinking area,\\\" she said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1934979/roadrunner.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A family discovered that a roadrunner climbed into their moving van and traveled across the country.

Their diets mainly consist of poisonous prey, like venomous lizards, scorpions and rattlesnakes.\", \"Winn said Avian Haven set up an area comfortable for the roadrunner to stay while the organization works with the Nevada Department of Wildlife to get the bird back home.\", \"Chelsey Gundlach, the rehabilitation manager with Aviation Haven, has prior knowledge of the type of habitat and meal plan the roadrunner needs. Although they are unable to provide his typical diet, Winn said he seems content eating mice for now.\", \"\\\"We gave him plenty of hiding places with artificial plants of different kinds,\\\" Winn said. \\\"We know he's eating and doesn't seem to be freaking out in the habitat we created for him. We minimized the stress as much as possible.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"ed9f261e47f511ecbaf1b3bf2b4da6b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ed9f261e47f511ecbaf1b3bf2b4da6b4"}},
