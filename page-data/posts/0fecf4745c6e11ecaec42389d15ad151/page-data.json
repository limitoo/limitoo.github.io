She was 62.\", \"The incident occurred off Kailua Beach in Oahu. Her husband and partner in the company, Andrew N. Chiang, in a posting on the company\\u2019s Facebook page, said that Ms. Chen went for a swim in the ocean and that her body was found by a passer-by.\", \"Ms. Chen was born in Taiwan and came to the United States in 1982, planning to earn a master\\u2019s degree at New York University (which she eventually did) and then return to her home country to teach. But the arts scene in New York proved irresistible.\", \"\\u201cI was so excited about the dancing in New York that I decided to stay rather than teach in Taiwan,\\u201d she told The TimesLedger of Queens in 2017.\", \"Six years later, she and Mr. Chiang started the Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company, which began performing in and around New York from its headquarters in Fort Lee, N.J. By the early 1990s, its touring circle had begun expanding, first to Massachusetts, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and then across the country and beyond.\", \"Ms. Chen had been trained in the traditional dances of Taiwan and China before settling in the United States, and her programs tended to give audience members \\u2014 many of whom, especially in the early years, were used to European-style dance \\u2014 a different view of the art form.\", \"\\u201cI like to integrate both aesthetics, Eastern and Western,\\u201d she told The Los Angeles Times in 1994. \\u201cMy dancers and I experiment every day. I believe that if I let movement come out naturally from my body, if I speak the truth from my heart, it will express my background \\u2014 traditional Chinese movement and a Western dance vocabulary.\\u201d\", \"The company performed traditional fan dances and ribbon dances, but also Ms. Chen\\u2019s own works, which drew on many influences. Her \\u201cMovable Figures,\\u201d for example, was inspired by Southeast Asian shadow puppetry. \\u201cDragons on the Wall (Tianji)\\u201d suggests Chinese calligraphy. \\u201cRaindrops\\u201d evokes her girlhood in Taiwan.\", \"\\u201cI remember as a child I would sit in my grandmother\\u2019s room and see the raindrops falling on the ground,\\u201d she told The Record of Bergen County, N.J., in 2003, when the work was on her program at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, a frequent stop for the troupe. \\u201cIt made such an interesting sound \\u2014 dut-dut-dut. It was very playful to me. Mysterious. It brought me wonder.\\u201d\", \"Nai-Ni Chen was born on Oct. 31, 1959, in Keelung, on the coast near Taipei, to MayYun Wu, a teacher, and Hsing-Yin Chen, a dentist.\", \"\\u201cMy parents always took us out to get close to nature, the ocean, the beach and the mountains,\\u201d she told The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in 1996, when her company performed in Fayetteville.\", \"\\u201cMany of my dances are inspired by nature,\\u201d she added. \\u201cThat\\u2019s the Chinese way and philosophy: to emphasize the relation between human and nature. We try to find a harmony there.\\u201d\", \"Greta Campo, a dancer and the company\\u2019s associate artistic director, experienced firsthand how Ms. Chen blended the various influences in her life and training.\", \"\\u201cHer cultural background was always an inspiration for her,\\u201d she said by email. \\u201cNai-Ni Chen\\u2019s works are so unique because they fused the freedom of American modern dance with the grace and splendor of Asian art.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Chen was exposed to American culture growing up in Taiwan, learning English as a second language and, as she told The Record in 1988, watching the movies of \\u201cthose two men \\u2014 the fat one and the thin one who were always getting in trouble.\\u201d That is, Laurel and Hardy.\", \"She began taking dance lessons at 4 and learned ballet and folk dance before enrolling, in her early teens, at the Chinese Culture University in Taipei, whose curriculum included modern dance, jazz and Chinese martial arts.\", \"She spent three years with the Cloud Gate Dance Theater, Taipei\\u2019s first contemporary dance company, and participated in several government-sponsored international tours. Mr. Chiang, who is Nai-Ni Chen Dance\\u2019s executive director, told The Star-Ledger in 1999 that he first met his future wife in 1978, when she was among a group of visiting dancers who performed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; he was enrolled there and was the student activities coordinator.\", \"\\u201cAt that first moment, I knew she was going to be my wife,\\u201d he told the newspaper, although Ms. Chen said she only vaguely remembered their initial backstage encounter. The two stayed in touch, and they married in 1982. Their daughter, Sylvia, also survives her.\", \"Ms. Chen\\u2019s dance company often performed at schools, where in the early years students generally had little exposure to Chinese arts.\", \"\\u201cThe kids just love it,\\u201d she told The Record in 1992. \\u201cChinese dance is very colorful, and it\\u2019s completely new to them.\\u201d\", \"She was particularly concerned with putting across the influence of Asian culture and Asian American immigrants on Western traditions. Yet it was a point of pride to her that her troupe was multiracial and multinational. Finding dancers who could handle the demands of blending the traditional and contemporary was, she acknowledged, challenging, but she thought the effort was worthwhile.\", \"\\u201cI feel positive because in the end, the message we are trying to convey to people has everything to do with sharing cultures in this smaller and smaller modern world,\\u201d she told The Star-Ledger in 1996. \\u201cPeople are interested, but there\\u2019s still a long way to go. It takes a certain kind of maturity to find something good in another, completely different and very foreign culture.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"0fecf4745c6e11ecaec42389d15ad151"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0fecf4745c6e11ecaec42389d15ad151"}},
