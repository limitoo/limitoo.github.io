Soon, all 20 wrestlers were paired off, working on hand fighting and then takedowns, staying focused, not stopping even when a mask slid down or popped off.\", \"Like every sports team at a public school in New York City, the wrestlers at Grand Street must be vaccinated, and those participating in contact sports must wear masks in practice and at competitions. These restrictions seem to have reduced the participants around the city \\u2014 this team normally would have 10 to 15 more students. But the bigger concern is the policy forbidding city students from even competing at tournaments where nonvaccinated athletes are allowed.\", \"It essentially bars city athletes from high-level competitions on Long Island and in Westchester County, proving grounds for the best wrestling programs, and from the state championships, which culminate the season. The city also canceled next month\\u2019s prestigious Mayor\\u2019s Cup because New York\\u2019s Catholic and private school students may not be vaccinated.\", \"Stephen Perez, the coach at Grand Street, said that for wrestling, the masks are almost absurd. The students are vaccinated (not to mention young and fit), and masks can shift and impede breathing during matches. The policy has raised questions, like what happens if a mask comes off during the action. \\u201cThere are no time outs in wrestling,\\u201d Mr. Perez said. \\u201cWhat does a referee do?\\u201d\", \"But for a high-achieving program like Grand Street\\u2019s, shutting the door to outside tournaments could cause lasting damage. \\u201cThe policy is excessive, and we\\u2019re hurting the kids,\\u201d said Mr. Perez, who was named the Public Schools Athletic League\\u2019s 2017 wrestling coach of the year. \\u201cOur top wrestlers need that level of competition to get better. And college coaches, including Division I schools, go to those big tournaments and the state championships. Students are getting robbed of an opportunity. What message are we sending our kids?\\u201d\", \"(Meanwhile, the city\\u2019s basketball and indoor track teams will be able to participate in their state championships because they are being held in New York City; in those cases students from suburban and upstate schools will be able to participate only if they are vaccinated.)\", \"Mr. Perez, 33, who teaches physical education and a leadership class mentoring freshmen at the school in Brooklyn, has been its wrestling coach for nine years. He knows what wrestling can mean to teenagers navigating life in New York City. He grew up in the Bronx and then Queens, where he started wrestling at Francis Lewis High School. He fell in love with the sport that took him to tournaments as far away as Alaska and even Russia, and which was a launchpad for his educational journey. He became a junior college all-American at Nassau County Community College, which led him to wrestling and a degree at SUNY Cortland in upstate New York.\", \"He is aware that the fate of wrestling tournaments during a pandemic needs to be kept in perspective, especially now that the Omicron variant has scrambled plans for sports, schools and everything else. But he does fret over his students\\u2019 futures. He points out that the wall of the wrestling room is adorned with photographs of past city champions and all-state wrestlers, many of whom went on to college thanks to their time on the mats. Before the pandemic, Grand Street won back-to-back city championships, producing stars like Jayden Cardenas, who placed fourth in the state in his weight class just weeks before the lockdown in 2020. Like his coach and mentor, he went to SUNY Cortland.\", \"This year, with participation way down at many schools, Mr. Perez also worries that opponents may end up forfeiting matches simply because they don\\u2019t have enough wrestlers, compounding the problem for his team of being deprived of strong competition outside the city.\", \"Brendan Buckley, executive director of Beat the Streets, a wrestling-focused nonprofit that emphasizes youth development, says no one is looking to bend the rules on vaccinations, but he agrees that the city policy seems unfair.\", \"\\u201cThe boys and girls who are wrestling have worked so hard and deserve the opportunity to compete,\\u201d Mr. Buckley said. \\u201cSport is one of the things that keeps them motivated to do well at school, and that\\u2019s being taken away from them. And this could certainly negatively impact their future.\\u201d\", \"The top wrestlers at Grand Street remain dedicated but are obviously frustrated. Mr. Ramirez, an 18-year-old senior who competes in the 172-pound class, finds the mask requirement silly but not enough to deter him. He also put aside his vaccine hesitancy so he could be on the team. \\u201cWrestling changes you physically but also mentally,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou have a stronger focus, which also helps with schoolwork.\\u201d\", \"During practice the team is extraordinarily focused, working hard, saying \\u201csir\\u201d in their responses (often in unison) to the coach. Yet Mr. Ramirez said he finds it harder to maintain focus since he feels shortchanged in terms of competition for his senior year.\", \"Wrestling had also been a motivating factor for Mr. Torres, who commutes from Queens to go to Grand Street and has been wrestling seriously since middle school. His family has long planned for wrestling to be his ticket to college. (He wrestles at 126 pounds.)\", \"During the height of the pandemic, Mr. Torres said, \\u201cI had tunnel vision and put all the work in to prepare for this year.\\u201d He added: \\u201cI know the college coaches go to tougher tournaments to see experienced wrestlers in good competition. I wanted to be ready.\\u201d\", \"The tournaments are crucial, Mr. Buckley said, since city schools lack the money of private and suburban schools, and spotty programs within the huge system mean competition can be inconsistent. \\u201cThey get to go to these tournaments that pit some of the best kids in the country against one another, and it really is a big deal if you knock off one of those and have a chance to tell a college coach, \\u2018Hey, here\\u2019s this big victory,\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe wrestlers in Long Island are doing that, and we want our kids to have those same opportunities. Even if they don\\u2019t earn a college scholarship, they may earn a spot on a college wrestling team.\\u201d\", \"The ban on outside tournaments seems especially illogical to Mr. Perez. His athletes are vaccinated, but he knows that outside of school hours they are hanging out with peers and relatives who are not.\", \"\\u201cWe also go upstate with our families already, so what\\u2019s the difference?\\u201d Mr. Torres said about the potential for exposure.\", \"The Public Schools Athletic League did not respond to requests for an interview; a spokesman for the city Education Department responded to emailed questions with a general statement, which reads in part, \\u201cWe knew it was critical to safely get students back to the sports they love this year and we\\u2019ve safely accomplished that because of our partnership with health experts to develop comprehensive guidance for high-risk sports that enables students to participate with reasonable safety measures.\\u201d\", \"The email did not address specific issues \\u2014 like what happens if a mask comes off during a match, or whether there might be a way to amend the policy to allow New York City wrestlers to compete in the state championships.\", \"The major suburban tournaments begin this month, and the state championships, in Albany, are scheduled for the last weekend in February. As of now, no New York City teams will participate.\", \"The athletes are so eager to compete that they\\u2019re willing to go an extra step to gain permission to wrestle in those outside tournaments. Mr. Ramirez says they\\u2019d give up the Long Island and Westchester tournaments just for a shot at the state\\u2019s. And he and Mr. Torres both say the wrestlers would gladly get tested for the virus after each tournament and not return to school until they have a negative result.\", \"\\u201cI would even wear a mask to compete against opponents that didn\\u2019t have to,\\u201d Mr. Torres added. \\u201cI\\u2019ll do any of that as long as I can wrestle.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"bd9fc638591b11ec8c114de70b3c8f23"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bd9fc638591b11ec8c114de70b3c8f23"}},
