Want a hit? And: Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky? (We usually said \\u201cyes\\u201d to the second before we got to the third.)\", \"My answer to that third question was: Neither. I was a Turgenev man. And then Chekhov. Dostoyevsky felt like something that had timed out after high school, like Pink Floyd. In my Russian literature major, I went for Bulgakov, Pasternak and Nabokov. I think I was trying to understand the century that made Russia so inhospitable to my family. Dostoyevsky was someone else\\u2019s genius.\", \"One of the humiliations of getting older is realizing that what felt like the enlightened separation of one\\u2019s interests from literary dogma may have been neglect of transcendental talent after all. Kevin Birmingham elicited this feeling with his first book, \\u201cThe Most Dangerous Book,\\u201d the story of how a drunken night in a Dublin pub became \\u201cUlysses.\\u201d He does it again with \\u201cThe Sinner and the Saint: Dostoevsky and the Gentleman Murderer Who Inspired a Masterpiece,\\u201d in which he gives the \\u201cUlysses\\u201d treatment to \\u201cCrime and Punishment.\\u201d\", \"This is a paired biography: Dostoyevsky\\u2019s double is a Frenchman named Pierre-Fran\\u00e7ois Lacenaire, who \\u201cwas born into a wealthy merchant family that lost its entire fortune just as he was coming of age, and the catastrophe untethered him.\\u201d Lacenaire\\u2019s slide culminated in murders of a convicted thief and his widowed mother in 1834. He came for money but stayed for the killing, stabbing the woman\\u2019s eyes with a file \\u201cgood for sharpening saws.\\u201d Then Lacenaire went to a comedy show. \\u201cThat was a great day for me,\\u201d he would recall. \\u201cI breathed again.\\u201d The murders provided him with purpose.\", \"Lacenaire\\u2019s defense of his acts as vengeance against unjust wealth on behalf of those with less was a convenient rebranding of egoism as moral resolve \\u2014 the people Lacenaire killed were marginal. However, in a country drifting between revolutions, he became a celebrity. Even people who should have known better, like Flaubert, admired him. Dostoyevsky, too, found Lacenaire \\u201cenigmatic, frightening and gripping.\\u201d But for the Russian author, Lacenaire\\u2019s actions had a plainer explanation: \\u201cboundless vanity.\\u201d\", \"Lacenaire was not the only model for Raskolnikov, the double murderer of \\u201cCrime and Punishment.\\u201d The killers who surrounded Dostoyevsky during his exile in Siberia (following his arrest for involvement in progressive political groups) were so mentally altered by lives of crime and the gothic abuses of penal servitude that Dostoyevsky\\u2019s account of that time, \\u201cNotes From a Dead House,\\u201d may actually be his most haunting book. (One prisoner considered it \\u201chis great fortune to have been beaten so mercilessly as a child\\u201d because it helped him endure the punishments of incarceration. Sometimes the guards were armed with \\u201cthree-foot rawhide thongs with metal tips that gouged the flesh.\\u201d)\", \"Birmingham\\u2019s chapters on Dostoyevsky\\u2019s exile are among the finest in his own book, too. Take this sentence: \\u201cOne can imagine walking for years through Siberia \\u2026 to where the shallow roots of larches cling to the veneer of soil on the permafrost, and farther still, past the thinning forests, to where the tundra tapers off to dwarf shrubs and delicate gray mosses beside frozen pools and arctic foxes scratch for earthworms on the roof of the world.\\u201d\", \"The Lacenaire link is not new. What is new is the way Birmingham has alchemized scholarship into a magisterially immersive, novelistic account of the author\\u2019s life. The heart pounds as Dostoyevsky, zero pages written just weeks before a book deadline would force him to surrender his royalties to a creditor for nine years, having already sold off everything he could to cover his and his extended family\\u2019s debts, reluctantly resolves to try dictation. And it pounds again as he, until now doomed in love, slowly finds it with Anna Snitkina, his stenographer. These episodes are the work of a skilled storyteller who understands that you need scenes made from, say, the concrete details of Snitkina\\u2019s diary \\u2014 as opposed to quotations from it, or summary, with commentary from the author, to make the tale come alive. (The guards\\u2019 thongs were rawhide.)\", \"This approach has risks. Early on, I occasionally longed for a better sense not only of Dostoyevsky but of Birmingham \\u2014 for instance, his judgment of Dostoyevsky\\u2019s first novel, \\u201cPoor Folk,\\u201d and certainly how he reconciled Dostoyevsky\\u2019s criticism of France\\u2019s 1848 revolution with his participation in anti-monarchical groups. But starting with Dostoyevsky\\u2019s time at the roulette tables in Wiesbaden, Germany \\u2014 his losses spurred the first pages of \\u201cCrime and Punishment\\u201d \\u2014 Birmingham maintains exceptional balance. (The 1867 trip Dostoyevsky and Snitkina, by then his wife, took to a nearby German spa town was the wellspring of another fine double narrative of Dostoyevsky\\u2019s life, Leonid Tsypkin\\u2019s \\u201cSummer in Baden-Baden.\\u201d)\", \"In its concreteness, Birmingham\\u2019s book sometimes improves on even fiction like J. M. Coetzee\\u2019s Dostoyevsky novel \\u201cThe Master of Petersburg,\\u201d which can be, in places, frustratingly broad. (\\u201cHe wears a dark suit of somewhat d\\u00e9mod\\u00e9 cut,\\u201d Coetzee writes. D\\u00e9mod\\u00e9 how?) It also complicates the popular notion, certainly encouraged by Coetzee\\u2019s book, that Dostoyevsky was tormented to the point of perversity. Here is Dostoyevsky in love, in self-sacrificing dedication to his brother\\u2019s ungrateful family and in fits of ecstasy that preceded his epileptic seizures.\", \"Reductiveness may be the cost of legend. Also of callowness: My youthful readings of \\u201cCrime and Punishment\\u201d left me with the impression that it was well-dressed advocacy for Christianity and suffering. But the novel, as Birmingham reminds us, is \\u201cabout the trouble with ideas. It is not a novel of ideas.\\u201d Ultimately, it is the work of an author whose insights into the idiosyncrasies that make written life feel real were spectacularly acute. In that sense, among others, \\u201cThe Sinner and the Saint\\u201d is a magnificent and fitting tribute.\"]","href_hash":"408e7cc146c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"408e7cc146c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
