Elmose said that people were able to \\\"pick the exact bed they always have wanted to try.\\\"\", \"\\\"We slept in the furniture exhibitions and our showroom on the first floor, where we have beds, mattresses and sofa beds,\\\" he said.\", \"All the used bedding and sheets were changed prior to the shop's reopening Thursday, he said.\", \"\\\"It was a really nice evening, enjoying each other's company,\\\" Elmose said. \\\"Everyone had a full night's sleep. Our mattresses are good.\\\"\", \"Large parts of Denmark, including the capital Copenhagen, were hit with adverse weather, which congested traffic and caused temporary power outages, Euronews reported. The snow also forced some flights and public transportation to come to a halt Wednesday.\", \"Hundreds of travelers at the Aalborg Airport were forced to stay in the terminal overnight after flights were grounded in the afternoon and the worsening conditions prevented buses from transporting passengers to hotels, The Local reported.\", \"\\\"We have around 300 people in the terminal right now and have been giving out blankets on the assumption they will be staying here tonight,\\\" Kim Bermann, operations manager at the airport, told local news outlet Nordjyske.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944269/denmark-snowstorm.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Customers and employees at an IKEA in northern Denmark were forced to sleep in the store overnight during a massive snowstorm.
