It's hoped the 26-year-old will also add some experience to the side, while Johnson will take responsibility from the word go.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Shaun is the most experienced and a marquee player for us, if he's fit and health he'll be leading the charge, then there's three other blokes that will be vying for that spot,\\\" Jones explains\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's been refreshing to Shaun around this group. He even helps us out as coaches, we're learning a lot from him.\\\"\", \"It's hoped Johnson, returning to the club after his 2018 departure, will improve the side's game management - which cost them last season after they lost six games by fewer than four points, including two in golden point.\", \"\\\"Last year it was an area where we lacked experience,\\\" Jones adds.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's evident when games are in the balance you need your key players to step up, and that comes with experience. It's a big work on and a key part of the game that we've gotta get right.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We've got a couple of experienced halves in Shaun and Ash, and with the growth of Chanel and Kodi there too, there's some real balance.\\\"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"99ba1266807911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"99ba1266807911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
