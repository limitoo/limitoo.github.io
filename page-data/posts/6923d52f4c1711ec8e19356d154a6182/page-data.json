The front and back panel base colour is a gradient to replicate the effect of sunlight breaking ocean.\", \"The left sleeve has traditional Samoan tatau and Tongan ngatu patterns arrayed in a design to represent the wind feeding into the sail as well as a traditional Tongan pattern as a sleeve trim.\", \"The right sleeve has a combination of modern Niuean design inspired by traditional Hiapo patterns, traditional Tokelauan and Cook Island inspired tatau designs.\", \"Sun motif from logo has been placed at the back of neck to re-enforce the idea of rising, youthfulness and power.\", \"Moana Pasifika players will wear their home jersey for the first game the new Super Rugby Pacific 2022 competition and their debut season in a home-game against the Brumbies at Mt Smart Stadium on 18 February.\", \"Patron Sir Bryan Williams said it was a special moment to imagine the team running out in the new jersey.\", \"\\\"When I see the boys run out for that first time, it's going to be very emotional, certainly for me and many others. It's been quite a long journey. Moana Pasifika is so important for our community because it represents our hopes and dreams for the future. To have Moana Pasifika running out and giving our people a cause for hope and able to dream is, I think, really important.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"6923d52f4c1711ec8e19356d154a6182"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6923d52f4c1711ec8e19356d154a6182"}},
