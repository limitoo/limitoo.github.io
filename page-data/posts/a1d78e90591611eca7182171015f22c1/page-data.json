I went six hours \\u2014 maybe even seven \\u2014 without seeing anything on the internet about what a disaster Kamala Harris is.\", \"I must have been haunting the wrong sites. I\\u2019d clearly failed to check in with Twitter. Whatever the reason, I had a reprieve from Democratic carping about Democratic crises that reflected Democratic disunity and brimmed with Democratic doomsaying. Being briefly starved of it made me even more aware of the usual buffet \\u2014 and of Democrats\\u2019 insatiable hunger for devouring their own.\", \"To follow Harris\\u2019s media coverage, made possible by the keening and wailing of her Democratic colleagues and Democratic analysts, she\\u2019s not merely mismanaging an apparently restless, frustrated staff. She\\u2019s bursting into flames and incinerating everything in her midst, including Democrats\\u2019 hopes of holding on to the White House in 2024.\", \"The chatter around Joe Biden is hardly cheerier. Riveted by low approval ratings for him that they\\u2019ve helped to create, Democrats in government murmur to Democrats in the media that he\\u2019s in dire political straits \\u2014 which is partly true, thanks in some measure to all those fellow Democrats. As Jonathan Chait wrote recently in a cover story for New York magazine, Biden is trapped \\u201cbetween a well-funded left wing that has poisoned the party\\u2019s image with many of its former supporters and centrists unable to conceive of their job in any terms save as valets for the business elite.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBiden\\u2019s party has not veered too far left or too far right so much as it has simply come apart,\\u201d Chait added. And it has done so noisily, its internal discontents as public as can be.\", \"These intraparty recriminations aren\\u2019t unusual in and of themselves: Democrats have never possessed Republicans\\u2019 talent for unity. But the intensity of the anger and angst are striking, especially given the stakes. A Republican takeover of Congress in 2022 and of the presidency two years later would endanger more than the social safety net. It would imperil democracy itself.\", \"\\u201cDemocrats, big and small D, are not behaving as if they believe the threat is real,\\u201d Barton Gellman wrote for The Atlantic this month. \\u201cSome of them, including President Joe Biden, have taken passing rhetorical notice, but their attention wanders. They are making a grievous mistake.\\u201d\", \"Gellman\\u2019s article, titled \\u201cTrump\\u2019s Next Coup Has Already Begun,\\u201d had an apocalyptic tone, matched by an accompanying note by the magazine\\u2019s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg. He wrote that while he prefers to avoid \\u201cpartisan entanglement,\\u201d he and the rest of us must confront the truth: \\u201cThe leaders of the Republican Party \\u2014 the soul-blighted Donald Trump and the satraps and lackeys who abet his nefarious behavior \\u2014 are attempting to destroy the foundations of American democracy. This must be stated clearly, and repeatedly.\\u201d\", \"Chait put it this way: \\u201cIt is scarcely an exaggeration to say that the fate of American democracy may hinge on President Joe Biden\\u2019s success.\\u201d\", \"But the media is drawn to, and amplifies, Biden\\u2019s failures. The Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank recently collaborated with the data analytics unit of the information company FiscalNote to measure journalists\\u2019 treatment of Biden versus Trump, and he concluded that \\u201cBiden\\u2019s press for the past four months has been as bad as \\u2014 and for a time worse than \\u2014 the coverage Trump received for the same four months of 2020.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMy colleagues in the media are serving as accessories to the murder of democracy,\\u201d he wrote, later adding: \\u201cThe country is in an existential struggle between self-governance and an authoritarian alternative. And we in the news media, collectively, have given equal, if not slightly more favorable, treatment to the authoritarians.\\u201d\", \"That news media includes more Democrats than Republicans. And its naysaying depends on the irascibility and volubility of Democratic officials complaining about other Democratic officials. Democrats don\\u2019t need Pelotons: They\\u2019ve turned finger pointing into an aerobic workout.\", \"Such self-examination and self-criticism are healthy to a point. And Democratic pessimism isn\\u2019t unfounded: Polls show real frustration and impatience among Americans, who reliably pin the blame on whoever is in charge. Additionally, the party\\u2019s loss in the Virginia governor\\u2019s race \\u2014 and the implications of that \\u2014 can\\u2019t be ignored.\", \"But neither can the potential consequences of some Democratic politicians\\u2019 refusals to compromise and come together. None of the ideological rifts within the party matter as much as what the current crop of Trump-coddling Republicans might do if given the chance.\", \"So enough about Biden\\u2019s age, about Harris\\u2019s unpopularity, about the impossibility of figuring out precisely the right note of Omicron caution, about lions and tigers and bears, oh my! It\\u2019s scary out there, sure. But it\\u2019ll be scarier still if Democrats can\\u2019t successfully project cooperation, confidence and hope.\", \"You\\u2019re going to giggle or groan at this line by Justin Ray, in The Los Angeles Times, about the disappearance of bivalves from a California beach: \\u201cThe clam community\\u2019s crash created a calamity.\\u201d (Thanks to Roy Oldenkamp of West Hollywood, Calif., for spotting and nominating this.)\", \"Same goes for this headline on an article in The Bulwark about a certain physician\\u2019s recently announced Senate bid: \\u201cDr. Oz Quacks the Code of Republican Politics.\\u201d (Steve Read, Nice, France)\", \"Here\\u2019s Derek Thompson in The Atlantic on the devolution of Congress: \\u201cFrom 1917 to 1970, the Senate took 49 votes to break filibusters, or less than one per year. Since 2010, it has had an average of 80 such votes annually. The Senate was once known as the \\u2018cooling saucer of democracy,\\u2019 where populist notions went to chill out a bit. Now it\\u2019s the icebox of democracy, where legislation dies of hypothermia.\\u201d (Weigang Qiu, Queens, N.Y.) Derek\\u2019s entire article is insightful, thought-provoking and very much worth reading.\", \"Here\\u2019s Michael J. Lewis in The Wall Street Journal on some of the more untraditional proposals for restoring the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, damaged from that 2019 fire: \\u201cIs that lovely victim, saved in the nick of time and made whole again, now to be whisked, still groggy, straight from the hospital into the tattoo parlor of contemporary art?\\u201d (Jim Lader, Bronxville, N.Y., and Kathleen Hopkins, Oak Park, Ill.)\", \"In a characteristically tongue-in-cheek commentary in The Washington Post, Alexandra Petri advocated the banning of all books: \\u201cThey make you cry, show you despair in a handful of dust, counterfeit life in strange ways and cheat you with shadows.\\u201d (Irma Wolfson, Irvine, Calif.) I was equally fond of these additional snippets: \\u201cBooks follow you home and pry open your head and rearrange the things inside.\\u201d They \\u201creplace your answers with questions or questions with answers.\\u201d \\u201cThey make strange things familiar to you and familiar things strange again.\\u201d\", \"Moving on to standouts from The Times: Reggie Ugwu profiled Ron Cephas Jones, noting that he\\u2019s \\u201cthe kind of actor who works like chipotle mayo \\u2014 you don\\u2019t always think to look for him, but you\\u2019re happy when he shows up.\\u201d (Peggy Sweeney, Sarasota, Fla.)\", \"Following his return to an area of Alaska that he hadn\\u2019t visited in more than 35 years, Jon Waterman contemplated climate change and caribou: \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t see many, but we knew they were out there, somewhere, cantering in synchronized, thousandfold troupes, inches apart yet never jostling one another, their leg tendons a veritable orchestra of clicking castanets, their hooves clattering on stones.\\u201d (Harriet Odlum, Bloomfield, Conn., and Robert Lakatos, Glenmoore, Pa.)\", \"In Bret Stephens\\u2019s weekly online conversation with Gail Collins, he noted: \\u201cThe supply-chain situation has gotten so out of hand that there\\u2019s even a cream-cheese shortage at New York City bagel shops, which is like one of the 10 biblical plagues as reimagined by Mel Brooks.\\u201d (Susan Gregory, Bala Cynwyd, Pa., and Deborah Paulus-Jagric, Landvetter, Sweden, among others)\", \"In a review of the Mel Brooks memoir \\u201cAll About Me!,\\u201d Alexandra Jacobs trots out the technical term for fear of heights to fashion this gem: \\u201cBrooks himself reads as the opposite of acrophobic: scaling the icy pinnacles of Hollywood without anything more than a pang of self-doubt, using humor as his alpenstock.\\u201d (Jennifer Finney Boylan, Rome, Maine)\", \"And in a preview of the new limited series on HBO Max \\u201cAnd Just Like That,\\u201d which continues and updates \\u201cSex and the City,\\u201d Alexis Soloski noted how little about its plot was revealed or known in advance: \\u201cEager fans have analyzed that 30-second teaser clip with the exegetical rigor typically reserved for ancient hieroglyphs.\\u201d (Allan Tarlow, West Hollywood, Calif.)\", \"To nominate favorite bits of recent writing from The Times or other publications to be mentioned in \\u201cFor the Love of Sentences,\\u201d please email me here, and please include your name and place of residence.\", \"Many of you chide me if I go two weeks or more without publishing an image of my furry companion. I love you for that. So here she is, during our walk on Sunday morning. We covered five miles, mostly in the woods, which we had to ourselves, because we headed out early and the weather was cold. She looked for deer and settled for squirrels, sprinting madly toward many of those she spotted. Much about dogs fascinates me but nothing more than their mix of tameness and wildness \\u2014 of gentleness and ferocity \\u2014 and the suddenness with which they shift between the two. One minute, a hugger. The next, a huntress. Regal all the while.\", \"I\\u2019m sick of the sound of my own voice.\", \"I know, I know: Writing those words is like wearing a \\u201ckick me\\u201d sign. The obvious rejoinder is that you\\u2019re sick of my voice, too. But you\\u2019d mean my musings, my opinions, and I mean the actual sound of my audible voice. I mean that I\\u2019ve been in a recording studio for much of this week, talking and talking and talking into a microphone.\", \"My next book is done \\u2014 more on that below \\u2014 and for the audio format, the publishers asked me to be the one to read it aloud. That made abundant sense: The book is largely about my own experiences, with long stretches in the first person. But, still, I was hoping they\\u2019d recruit someone else.\", \"That\\u2019s because I\\u2019ve done this twice previously, for earlier books, and it\\u2019s no cakewalk. (Or should that be caketalk?) You have to go slowly and enunciate clearly, and if you bobble a word, you redo much of the sentence or even paragraph. Forward, backward, forward, backward. You\\u2019re a Sisyphus of syllables.\", \"For my memoir \\u201cBorn Round,\\u201d I was in a studio in Manhattan devoted to audiobooks. I noticed a basket of muffins and bagels right outside the airless, soundproof booth in which the reader sits. \\u201cHow hospitable!\\u201d I thought.\", \"No. How strategic. Many readers, like me, have skipped breakfast and may be planning, for efficiency\\u2019s sake, to skip lunch. Their stomachs growl. Mine did. And the microphone picked it up. The solution was a chunk of sound-muffling starch.\", \"The studio\\u2019s technicians told me that some of the actors hired to record novels refuse those calories. So blankets are wrapped around their tiny waists, to silence hunger\\u2019s roar.\", \"The studio I\\u2019ve been using this week is here in Chapel Hill, N.C., just a 15-minute drive from my house. I\\u2019ve eaten a light breakfast each morning; my stomach has behaved. And so the audio should be ready for release, along with hardcover and digital versions, on March 1.\", \"The book, \\u201cThe Beauty of Dusk: On Vision Lost and Found,\\u201d is about my brush with the prospect of blindness and how that changed the way I look at setbacks and limits and aging. And I mention it in part as a segue into an update on my eyes, which many of you kindly and regularly ask about.\", \"My right eye will forever be useless for reading, computer work and the like, but my left eye hangs in there, undiminished. The nature of what happened to me, a kind of stroke of the optic nerve, is such that if my left eye does fail me, it is likely to do so in an instant. There\\u2019s perhaps a 20 percent chance of that.\", \"So I\\u2019ll be good until I\\u2019m not. But even then, I\\u2019ll manage. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019ve come to see. That\\u2019s what the book is really about: acceptance, resilience, optimism. It describes the honing of those qualities. It\\u2019s also the fruit of them.\", \"It\\u2019s alchemy \\u2014 trepidation into determination \\u2014 or at least intends to be. And the opportunity to tell my story is a privilege, as is the invitation to perform it, no matter how Sisyphean. I shush my stomach. I clear my throat. I raise my voice.
