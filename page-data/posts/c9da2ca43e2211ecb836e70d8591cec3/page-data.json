My colleagues and I will tell you about six stories that we can\\u2019t stop thinking about and that you may have missed this week.\", \"They are a mix of long and short, from The Times and not. If you have a little time, we recommend reading any that intrigue you. If you don\\u2019t, we hope you enjoy our curation. We think that the stories capture some of the undercurrents of American life right now.\", \"And have a good weekend. I\\u2019ll see you in your inbox on Monday.\", \"Airlines have canceled thousands of flights. Lines at stores \\u2014 especially drugstores \\u2014 have grown. Restaurants no longer carry some items, like physical menus.\", \"The quality of many services has deteriorated since the start of the pandemic \\u2014 a problem that the NPR show \\u201cPlanet Money\\u201d has labeled \\u201cskimpflation.\\u201d This deterioration, in turn, is feeding Americans\\u2019 dissatisfaction with the state of the economy, as well as with life in general and with President Biden\\u2019s performance, as Helaine Olen explained in The Washington Post.\", \"\\u201cAmericans, as I am forever fond of pointing out, view civic life through the role of consumer,\\u201d Olen wrote. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t encounter the government every day (or at least don\\u2019t believe we do), but we do shop and use in-person services almost constantly. And compared to the past, American consumption is getting both increasingly expensive and, well, decreasingly nice.\\u201d\", \"When will the situation return to normal? Nobody knows. The answer will help determine the national mood during next year\\u2019s midterm campaign.\", \"An extraordinary open letter appeared in a public Google Doc this spring. It was signed by 93 students at Jewish seminaries \\u2014 representing nearly one-fifth of all students at the U.S. schools where they were studying \\u2014 and it was harshly critical of Israel.\", \"The back story of that letter and the movement behind it is the subject of a Times Magazine article by Marc Tracy. The movement\\u2019s members are young, progressive Jews who are rethinking their support for Israel and who ground their arguments in Jewish texts.\", \"They still represent a minority of American Jews; most support a Jewish state, even if they have criticisms of Israeli policy. But Marc\\u2019s exploration of these young rabbis \\u2014 complete with a visit to a part-kibbutz, part-summer camp in Connecticut \\u2014 gets at a larger tension in the country today: In one area after another, a new generation of progressives believes that their predecessors were too accepting of injustice.\", \"If you don\\u2019t yet have an opinion about Dormzilla, you may need one.\", \"Charlie Munger, a billionaire and longtime deputy to Warren Buffett, donated $200 million to the University of California, Santa Barbara, several years ago with some specific conditions. The gift would pay for a new dorm \\u2014 on a campus with too little housing \\u2014 that would be named for Munger and that Munger (who is not an architect) would design.\", \"The 11-story building was projected to house 4,500 students. About 94 percent of the units would have no access to natural light or fresh air. After a Los Angeles architect on a university advisory committee resigned in protest, the story of Dormzilla, as The Santa Barbara Independent calls it, went national. It was a tale of generational inequality and billionaire hubris.\", \"Or was it? In New York magazine, Choire Sicha argued that Dormzilla is actually a solution to some of our problems. We need more housing density and fewer spaces that go unused for large chunks of the day. Nobody can look out of a window while they\\u2019re asleep.\", \"An annual holiday to honor the dead \\u2014 begun in Mexico and known as D\\u00eda de los Muertos \\u2014 took place early this week. A typical celebration revolves around an ofrenda, an offering that includes a photograph of the deceased person.\", \"The Los Angeles Times suggested that readers submit a digital ofrenda and published the hundreds of responses that it received. Together, they are a poignant statement about a year with far too much illness and death.\", \"On Saturday night, Americans will set their clocks back one hour, but there is a growing movement against the annual fall-back tradition.\", \"It favors permanent daylight saving time, which would lead to lighter winter afternoons and darker winter mornings. The Times\\u2019s Argument podcast hosted an expert who said that the change would reduce rush-hour vehicle accidents and energy usage. (A bipartisan group of senators has proposed a bill along these lines, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington gave a speech yesterday making the case for it.)\", \"Josh Barro of Insider has made the other side of the argument, writing that the sun shouldn\\u2019t rise after 8 a.m. in December \\u2014 and that when the U.S. tried permanent daylight saving time during the 1970s energy crisis, people hated it. Barro\\u2019s message: Feel free to keep whining, but turn back your clocks.\", \"\\u201cEven in the busiest of places, if you have a good book, you can retreat into solitude,\\u201d my colleague Anika Burgess writes. \\u201cAnd when you live in a city like New York, a book can be even more than a story at your fingertips. It can also be a respite, an escape, a sanctuary, a diversion and a travel companion.\\u201d\", \"As part of its 125th anniversary celebration, The Times Book Review published photos of people sneaking some reading time around New York.

Last week, Facebook rebranded as Meta.\", \"\\u201cFor now, talk of the metaverse is mainly a branding exercise: an attempt to unify, under one conceptual banner, a bunch of things that are already taking shape online,\\u201d Herrman wrote this week. \\u2014 Sanam Yar, a Morning writer\", \"Read Kevin Noble Maillard on fry bread, a dish that\\u2019s a comfort food and a relic of colonial displacement for Indigenous people.
