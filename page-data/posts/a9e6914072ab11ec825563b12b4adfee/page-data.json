Morrison's office said the Australian leader had \\\"explained our non-discriminatory border policy,\\\" while Serbian media reports said Brnabic emphasised the importance of Djokovic being able to prepare for the tournament. Both said they agreed to stay in contact on the issue.\", \"John Alexander, a member of Morrison's Liberal Party and a former professional tennis player, said it would be a mistake for Immigration Minister Alex Hawke to use his discretionary powers to deport the Serbian player.\", \"To do so would \\\"diminish\\\" the status of the Australian Open, Alexander said.\", \"\\\"We had previously been the poor cousin of the four events,\\\" he said. \\\"We've got a lot going for us, but we need to treat it carefully.\\\"\", \"Hawke's office said late on Monday the minister was still considering whether he would use his discretion under the Migration Act to cancel Djokovic's visa for a second time. Spokespeople for the minister did not return calls seeking comment on Tuesday.\", \"The ATP, the governing body of men's tennis applauded the court ruling, saying the dispute was \\\"damaging on all fronts, including for Novak's well-being and preparation for the Australian Open.\\\"\", \"The ATP said the situation highlighted the need for clearer understanding and communication of the rules. It said it strongly recommends all players get vaccinated and noted that 97% of the top 100 players are vaccinated.\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"a9e6914072ab11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a9e6914072ab11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
