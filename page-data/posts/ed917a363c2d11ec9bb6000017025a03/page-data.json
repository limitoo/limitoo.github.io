Overall, he stole a combined $32 million in personal savings from his trusting victims.\", \"Since 2013, Gallagher encouraged his listeners to invest in his retirement planning firm called the Gallagher Financial Group. His elderly victims gave him anywhere from $50,000 to $600,000 each in personal savings for investment.\", \"In-person and on the radio, he marketed himself as \\\"The Money Doctor,\\\" promising great returns. Unbeknownst to his investors, he lacked the required state license needed to be an investment adviser, The Dallas Morning News reported.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1924902/william-gallagher-christian-radio-host-ponzi-scheme.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A Texas Christian radio host named William Neil Gallagher will spend the rest of his life in prison after making millions off of his listeners through a ponzi scheme.

His Christian AM radio show also added to his perceived trustworthiness, as did the personal relationships he built with investors.\", \"In August, Gallagher pleaded guilty to three charges involving deception, theft and misapplication of funds over $200,000. He received a life term for each of the charges. Judge Elizabeth Beach also sentenced him to three 10-year prison sentences, for one count of forgery and two counts of exploitation of the elderly. The sentences must all be served consecutively.\", \"\\\"Doc Gallagher is one of the worst offenders I have seen,\\\" said Lori Varnell, chief of the Tarrant County District Attorney's Elder Financial Fraud team.\", \"\\\"He ruthlessly stole from his clients who trusted him for almost a decade. He...exploited many elder individuals. He worked his way around churches preying on people who believed he was a Christian,\\\" Varnell added.\", \"A Dallas County judge sentenced Gallagher to 25 years in state prison on March 27, 2020. Additionally, the court ordered him to pay $10,386,816 in restitution to his victims. Many of his victims will never see their money again.\", \"His 2016 book, Jesus Christ, Money Master instructed readers on how to reap \\\"the benefits of putting Christ back in the center\\\" of their personal spending habits.
