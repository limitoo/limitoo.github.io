Brown of Buffalo, an incumbent four-term Democrat, declared victory on Tuesday night in his write-in campaign to defeat his own party\\u2019s official nominee, India Walton. But Ms. Walton, a democratic socialist, refused to concede.\", \"The political oddity of a potent write-in campaign and a battle pitting moderates versus progressives inside the Democratic Party turned this city\\u2019s usually lackluster mayoral race into one of the most closely watched contests in the nation. A win for Mr. Brown \\u2014 the city\\u2019s first Black mayor and a lifelong Democratic centrist \\u2014 would be a stinging rebuke for the progressive wing of his party, which had celebrated Ms. Walton\\u2019s unlikely primary victory in June.\", \"The results reported early on Wednesday by the Erie County Board of Elections underscored the Democrats\\u2019 ideological schism. With all precincts reporting, just over 41 percent of votes were for Ms. Walton and 58.3 percent were marked for \\u201cwrite-in,\\u201d or 23,986 to 34,273.\", \"There is at least one other write-in candidate who has actively campaigned: Benjamin Carlisle, a former Democrat. Ballots marked \\u201cwrite-in\\u201d will have to be checked individually to see which candidate \\u2014 Mr. Brown, Mr. Carlisle, or others \\u2014 is indicated. And absentee ballots will not be tallied until mid-November.\", \"Ms. Walton, who had earned the endorsements of some of the nation\\u2019s best-known progressives, said on Tuesday night that \\u201cevery vote needs to be counted\\u201d and railed against the Brown campaign, which did not reject support from Republicans, a small cohort in this heavily Democratic city.\", \"\\u201cRight now it\\u2019s \\u2018Walton\\u2019 against \\u2018Write In,\\u2019 whoever that is,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWho Write-In is remains to be seen.\\u201d\", \"Still, the results boosted the hopes and mood of Mr. Brown, who lost to Ms. Walton in a Democratic primary in June, after running a lackluster campaign.\", \"\\u201cThey said it was impossible to win as a write-in, but you can never count a Buffalonian out,\\u201d said Mr. Brown to a raucous crowd at a downtown event on Tuesday night, adding he would find a way to thank all his voters \\u201cover the next four years.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis hasn\\u2019t been easy,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s been worth it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"1349f2e63cc211ecbef9000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1349f2e63cc211ecbef9000017025a03"}},
