(Anchor, 288 pp., $16.) \\u201cYou wouldn\\u2019t expect a comic novel about a dictionary to be a thriller too, but this one is,\\u201d our reviewer, Patricia T. O\\u2019Conner, wrote, adding that \\u201cThe Liar\\u2019s Dictionary\\u201d is also \\u201ca mystery, love story (two of them) and cliffhanging melodrama.\\u201d\", \"LEAVE THE WORLD BEHIND, by Rumaan Alam. (Ecco, 272 pp., $16.99.) Alam\\u2019s third novel, which was shortlisted for last year\\u2019s National Book Award, follows a New York City couple and their two children as they decamp to an Airbnb on Long Island \\u2014 \\u201conly $340 a day\\u201d \\u2014 where they discover that life as they know it is over. Afia Atakora, who reviewed it for us, said, \\u201c\\u2018Leave the World Behind\\u2019 teeters on that seesaw-edge question in horror fiction: to reveal the monster or not?\\u201d\", \"CATCHING THE WIND: Edward Kennedy and the Liberal Hour, 1932-1975, by Neal Gabler. (Crown, 928 pp., $20.) According to Jeff Shesol, who reviewed this book for us, \\u201cKennedy\\u2019s expansive life has yielded no shortage of biographies, but Gabler\\u2019s is on its way toward becoming the most complete and ambitious.\\u201d The first of two volumes, it carries the reader only about a dozen years into Kennedy\\u2019s nearly 47-year Senate run.\", \"ECONOMIC DIGNITY, by Gene Sperling. (Penguin, 384 pp., $18.) Sperling\\u2019s thoughtful blueprint for developing a comprehensive progressive economic policy \\u201cmakes a forceful case that only by speaking to matters of the spirit can liberals root their belief in economic justice in people\\u2019s deepest aspirations \\u2014 in their sense of purpose and self-worth,\\u201d James Traub wrote in our pages.\", \"THE OFFICE OF HISTORICAL CORRECTIONS: A Novella and Stories, by Danielle Evans. (Riverhead, 288 pp., $17.) This collection \\u201creflects on recent mythologies surrounding American race relations,\\u201d Jane Hu wrote here, adding, \\u201cThe propulsive narratives read as though they\\u2019re getting away with something, building what feel like novelistic plots onto the short story\\u2019s modest real estate.\\u201d\", \"ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT: The Oral History of Richard Linklater\\u2019s \\u201cDazed and Confused,\\u201d by Melissa Maerz.
