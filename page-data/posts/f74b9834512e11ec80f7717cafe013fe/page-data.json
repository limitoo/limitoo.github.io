Well, that\\u2019s done then: Thanksgiving sorted, Hanukkah started and holiday cookie season (above) on its way. I hope you\\u2019ll take some time for yourself this week, to cook the food you want to make.\", \"For myself, that\\u2019s Eric Kim\\u2019s recipe for kimchi jjigae with ribs, and the cheese enchiladas with chili gravy I learned to make from the Texas restaurateur Robb Walsh. It\\u2019s Kay Chun\\u2019s sesame salmon bowls and Hetty McKinnon\\u2019s tofu larb. It\\u2019s the smoked bulgur and pomegranate salad that Joan Nathan picked up from the chef Ori Menashe. It\\u2019s always and forever French onion soup.\", \"And, man, I\\u2019d love to make some paneer, as Tejal Rao advised in The Times this week, for a riff on a dish that the chef Chintan Pandya serves at his restaurant Dhamaka in New York, paneer ajwaini tikka. Here\\u2019s Tejal: \\u201cIt\\u2019s one of the simplest fresh cheeses for home cooks to tackle because it\\u2019s fast and it doesn\\u2019t require rennet to form the curds, just an easy-to-find acid like lemon juice or vinegar.\\u201d Oh, and a paneer press! I found one online for under $20 and it will arrive this week.\", \"Also, I think it\\u2019d be super to make some dinner sandwiches soon. Years ago, after a trip to Boston to interview the chef overseeing the student cafeterias at Boston College, I worked out a recipe for the school\\u2019s Screaming Eagle cheese-steak sub and served a number of them at a dinner party heralding a colleague. That was an exceptional early winter night that I\\u2019d like to recreate. But I wouldn\\u2019t sneeze at a tuna club, if the family raises a flag at the meat bomb.\", \"There are thousands more recipes waiting for you on New York Times Cooking.

You should check that out.\", \"Aruna D\\u2019Souza, meanwhile, alerted me to Jennifer Packer\\u2019s solo show at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, via her terrific review in The Times.\", \"And here\\u2019s Scott Sayare in Harper\\u2019s, on \\u201cThe Odor of Things,\\u201d a meditation on perfume and the mysteries of scent.\", \"Finally, Earl Sweatshirt is back, with \\u201c2010.\\u201d Listen to that a few times and I\\u2019ll return on Wednesday.\"]","href_hash":"f74b9834512e11ec80f7717cafe013fe"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f74b9834512e11ec80f7717cafe013fe"}},
