We don't know when that will happen. We don't have visibility of that yet.\\\"\", \"Fyfe said he would like to see the country move from seven days of self-isolation to a framework where a traveller was tested pre-departure and on arrival, and then waited at home for a PCR result.\", \"\\\"And if that comes back negative you're treated the same as everyone else and I would hope that we could be in that position around the middle of the year. That would be my ambition.\", \"\\\"That would be really embraced by particularly the inbound tourism industries and visitor industries.\", \"\\\"So I'd like to see that happen, but I understand why we can't make that decision today as we're facing into a Omicron wave that's going to hit New Zealand but I'd hope well before we get to June that there's serious consideration for that possibility.\\\"\", \"He was still hopeful that the government will make it much easier for Australians to skip home isolation for the winter ski season to help boost areas like Queenstown.\", \"\\\"[Ardern] didn't mention much about about the removal of self isolation or home isolation requirements. So she was mum on that but I think the world is moving down that path. We're going to be an outlier if we don't move to that position say some time around the middle of the year.\\\"\", \"He agreed that with record low unemployment and businesses crying out for workers, the provision to allow some skilled workers to enter the country was significant.\", \"Workers were needed across the economy and some businesses might be frustrated at the pace of allowing foreign workers to enter.\", \"\\\"But I do accept that it has to progress gradually. You can't just open the floodgates in one go and and accept the risk to the health system,\\\" Fyfe said.\", \"Asked how much confidence he has that the government will stick to its timeline and not delay it in the face of a large number of Omicron cases, he said the government understands the consequences of \\\"stop start, on off\\\".\", \"\\\"I think the government is very committed that we're past the phase of using lockdown unless we're in absolute crisis. I think the same goes for once we move into this border framework - they won't move backwards unless there's a genuine health crisis that demands it and based on Omicron and what I'm seeing around the world, I don't think that that is a high risk for us.\\\"\", \"The plan also provides some relief for tourism providers, however, Tourism New Zealand chief executive Rene de Monchy agreed the self isolation requirements would be a deterrent for many visitors.\", \"Those who had family and friends here would not find it a barrier and home isolation periods would gradually reduce, making it more attractive for international visitors, he said.\", \"October is a key month for the country as it heads into the peak summer period.\", \"This meant winter would still be difficult for many local tourism providers and it would be vital to keep encouraging New Zealanders to visit their own backyard.\", \"Tourism NZ is still promoting the country overseas so people \\\"can dream for that future trip\\\" which can take months or years to plan.\", \"\\\"We need people to be dreaming about that now so that they can convert it to what will more likely be [a visit] later in the year as we head into those summer months.\\\"\", \"Asked if young backpackers would still see Aotearoa as an attractive destination, he said they would and because they came for longer the self-isolation period may not be so daunting for them.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/104947/eight_col_camper.jpg?1491180616\\\" alt=\\\"Wendekreisen, campervan, camper van\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nA Wendekreisen campervan. \\nPhoto: 123RF\\n</div>\", \"De Monchy said the emphasis for attracting international travellers was still \\\"the high quality visitors\\\", and looking beyond the spending levels and what value they can bring and what time of year they would like to visit.\", \"Skiing holidays with isolation requirements would be a challenge but if the government changed its isolation requirements, Australians would be able to respond quickly to any opportunities.\"]","href_hash":"130b248c855411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"130b248c855411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
