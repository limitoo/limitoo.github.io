The footage was taken by Brandi Johnson, from Dexter, while she was out walking near her home.\", \"In a Facebook post, Georgia DNR said Johnson almost stepped on the snakes. Luckily, she noticed the pair and started filming the encounter\\u2014dubbed a \\\"once-in-a-lifetime wildlife interaction to witness.\\\"\", \"\\\"Kingsnakes are large, black snakes that can be found throughout the state,\\\" the Facebook post said. \\\"They are strong constrictors, capable of consuming a wide variety of prey items, including venomous snakes.\\\"\", \"The footage shows the kingsnake slithering along a road towards the smaller timber rattlesnake before striking at its prey. The kingsnake then coils around the rattlesnake. The video then cuts to the kingsnake in some undergrowth where it is devouring the rattlesnake, with the caption \\\"nom nom nom.\\\"\", \"Kingsnakes are found across the eastern U.S., including all areas of Georgia. They can grow up to around 4 feet in length and are powerful constrictors. Kingsnakes consume a variety of animals, including rodents, birds, turtle eggs, lizards and other snakes.\", \"They are found in many habitats, including pine forests, swamps, tidal wetlands and hardwood forests. They have also been found in suburban areas and farmlands. They are a protected species in Georgia.\", \"\\\"Kingsnakes are resistant to the venom of pit vipers and are known to readily eat copperheads, cottonmouths and rattlesnakes,\\\" Georgia DNR wrote in the Facebook post. \\\"They will usually strike and grasp snake prey near the head before coiling around, constricting and swallowing headfirst.\\\"\", \"It said Johnson identified both snake species straight away and kept a safe distance so as not to disturb the predation event.\", \"The timber rattlesnake is a type of pit viper. It is a venomous species also found across Georgia. Their size tends to vary depending on their habitat, but tend to grow to around four or five feet.\", \"While rare, timber rattlesnakes are known to bite humans and their venom can be fatal if untreated. In June, a 5-year-old girl from south Georgia was repeatedly bitten on the leg by a timber rattlesnake after it had cornered the family cat by a tree. Maisy Lamica was rushed to hospital where she was in a critical condition. She was treated with antivenom and after almost a week in hospital she was sent home where she continued her recovery.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935241/kingsnake.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Stock photo of an eastern kingsnake.
