It's not yet clear how vaccines will hold up against the new and markedly different Omicron mutant. But there's strong evidence that boosters offer a jump in protection against delta-caused infections, currently the biggest threat.\", \"Complicating the decision to extend boosters to 16- and 17-year-olds is that the Pfizer shot\\u2014and a similar vaccine made by Moderna\\u2014have been linked to a rare side effect. Called myocarditis, it's a type of heart inflammation seen mostly in younger men and teen boys.\", \"Health officials in Israel, which already gives boosters to teens, have said the side effect continues to be rare with third doses.\", \"A U.S. study this week offered additional reassurance. Researchers from children's hospitals around the country checked medical records and found the rare side effect usually is mild and people recover quickly, while COVID-19 itself can cause more serious heart inflammation.
