She showed him laying the leather of the tefillin around his left arm. She explained that this is something Jewish boys start doing at their bar mitzvah.\", \"\\\"Tefillin (Phylacteries) are worn once a day during prayer by Jewish men,\\\" the caption of the video read. \\\"The Torah command is in Deut. 6:8.\\\"\", \"In the comments, people commented that wrapping tefillin in the morning was one of their favorite parts of being Jewish.\", \"\\\"It feels like I am embraced by the Divine,\\\" one user wrote.\", \"But many others began commenting about how they were disappointed by the amount of antisemitic comments they were seeing. Some compared the Tefillin to a VR set, others said it reminded them of a GoPro camera.\", \"Others users began commenting crude jokes about the Holocaust and referenced antisemitic rhetoric.\", \"\\\"Zey are in ze attic,\\\" one user wrote.\", \"On Strauss' Instagram, she wrote that she will not stop sharing about Judaism and that she will call out antisemitism when she sees it.\", \"\\\"I believe it is so important we continue to call out antisemitism and the platforms that allow it to happen with no consequences because people actually think it's cool to make fun of Jews,\\\" she wrote on Instagram. \\\"That is very scary.\\\"\", \"Recent studies have shown that antisemitism on TikTok rose by more than 912 percent from 2020 to 2021. The four-month-long study found an increase in not only rhetoric but also antisemitic tropes and imagery. It was also discovered that the amount of antisemitic usernames spiked from 4 in 2020 to 59 this year.\", \"Recently, the American Jewish Committee called for action against the \\\"severe problem\\\" of antisemitism in the United States. In a survey conducted by the AJC, about 39 percent of respondents said they changed some of their behaviors in the past year to avoid antisemitism.\", \"The AJC said this is done by avoiding items that are identifiably Jewish and avoiding posting content online that would identify them.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935715/young-jewish-boy-laying-tefillin.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A teenage boy went viral on TikTok after he showed how he laid his Tefillin for morning prayer.
