Last week, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece also announced more restrictions for the country\\u2019s unvaccinated, barring them from cinemas, theaters and gyms.\", \"A spokesman for the French government said on Wednesday that the country would tighten its health pass, speed up its vaccination campaign and strengthen social distancing rules.\"]","href_hash":"b48824be4d5411ec9e9669a9812fa393"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b48824be4d5411ec9e9669a9812fa393"}},
