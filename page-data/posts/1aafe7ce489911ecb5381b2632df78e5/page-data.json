It\\u2019s a wink-wink moment because everyone knows the challenges. We know them, Mills knows them and so do these characters, who are sensitive and concerned. The brother has been taking care of his sister\\u2019s son and is gently mocking himself with his observation \\u2014 kids are a lot! \\u2014 though he\\u2019s also drawing attention to himself and the work he\\u2019s put in.\", \"A story about love and the eternal tug of war between self-interest and caring for others, \\u201cC\\u2019mon C\\u2019mon\\u201d is a nice movie about characters who are so nice that I almost feel bad for not being nicely disposed toward them or this movie, even with Joaquin Phoenix as the guy and Gaby Hoffmann as the sister. Their characters, Johnny and Viv, get the story rolling when she says she needs to deal with her husband (Scoot McNairy), who\\u2019s suffering a mental-health crisis. Johnny steps in to help with her 9-year-old, Jesse, played by Woody Norman, a charmer who looks a bit like a peewee Mathieu Amalric.\", \"The story tracks what happens when Johnny, who\\u2019s single and has no children, steps into the parenting role. Although it\\u2019s foreign territory for him, he approaches his new responsibilities with kindness and openness, if rather too much unconvincing, narratively expedient na\\u00efvet\\u00e9. Certainly the family\\u2019s redrawn geometry proves beneficial for Viv and Johnny, who were estranged and now frequently check in with each other, phoning and texting. Viv misses her son, and is reaching out, but she\\u2019s also coaching Johnny, teaching him how to handle Jesse. And, as the siblings talk and talk, their complex past burbles up.\", \"Mills manages the preliminaries seamlessly, creating an instant sense of cohesion and flow: You believe and recognize these people and places. Although he always lavishes conspicuous attention on the visual scheme of his movies \\u2014 everything is very precise, very arranged \\u2014 his gift is for the seductive sense of intimacy among characters, which quickly turns actors into people you care about. That\\u2019s true even when he\\u2019s working with established performers like Christopher Plummer in \\u201cBeginners\\u201d (an autobiographical movie about Mills\\u2019s father) and Annette Bening in \\u201c20th Century Women\\u201d (about his mother). \\u201cC\\u2019mon C\\u2019mon\\u201d was inspired by Mills\\u2019s relationship with his child.\", \"Shot in black and white, which gives the visuals a jewel-like shimmer and a patina of misplaced nostalgia, the movie opens with Johnny on the road. He\\u2019s in Detroit, gathering material for a radio documentary about children. Now, alone in a hotel room, he speaks into a microphone, cycling through his interview questions. He opens with: \\u201cWhen you think about the future, how do you imagine it will be?\\u201d He then turns to nature and cities and families, the scene ending just after he asks: \\u201cWhat makes you happy?\\u201d Over the course of the movie, Johnny continues to ask these existentially freighted questions, eventually finding his own answers through his evolving relationship with Jesse.\", \"And so while Viv cares for Paul, Johnny tends to Jesse. Johnny also takes Jesse on the road with him, so he can work on the documentary. There are giggles and laughs, pinpricks of pain and storms of emotion. Over time, as the connection between Johnny and Jesse tightens, their respective wariness gives way to deeper feelings and mutual appreciation. Yet, while the story\\u2019s emotional weight is meant to rest in the moments of tenderness between these two, and especially how they effect Johnny \\u2014 his issues, his growth, his capacity for love \\u2014 the characters never register as deeply or have the poignancy of the scenes with the nonprofessional children whom Johnny interviews.\", \"Phoenix, bearded and in full shambolic mode (he often looks as if he just woke up), nevertheless makes an appealing center of gravity. That\\u2019s useful, because the more Johnny gropes his way through his parenting duties, the more exasperating the character becomes, and the more precious and self-regarding the movie feels. Mills smartly keeps the dramatic incidents in a minor key, and while Johnny and Jesse bond, they also argue over small stuff. Jesse makes sense as a character and periodically acts out \\u2014 he\\u2019s a kid (a person!) and worried about his dad \\u2014 but Johnny increasingly seems like a storytelling contrivance, as well as a lesson in enlightened gender roles.\", \"At one point, Johnny picks a book up from Viv\\u2019s desk. \\u201cMotherhood,\\u201d he reads in thoughtful voice-over, \\u201cis the place in our culture where we lodge or rather bury the reality of our own conflicts, of what it means to be fully human.\\u201d As he continues reading, the text shifts to mothers themselves: \\u201cWhy on earth should it fall to them to paint things bright and innocent and safe?\\u201d These are good questions. The answers are also staggeringly obvious, and it\\u2019s difficult to know whether Mills thinks these thoughts are revelatory or whether he wants us to think that Johnny \\u2014 a 21st century, presumably well-educated, ostensibly enlightened bougie, NPR-style journalist \\u2014 has been living under a rock.\", \"It\\u2019s hard not to regret that \\u201cC\\u2019mon C\\u2019mon\\u201d isn\\u2019t about Viv, a spiky, persuasively honest character who\\u2019s actually one of the mothers Johnny reads about. But, much like the children whose words and faces are sprinkled throughout the movie, Viv is mostly on hand to help Johnny on his journey. Unlike her, these kids aren\\u2019t fictional, and their inclusion is a terrible miscalculation: \\u201cC\\u2019mon C\\u2019mon\\u201d is too slight and too narrow a vessel to bear the intense weight of their reality. These children are tentative, painfully sincere and at times terribly raw. And while their future may not necessarily be bright, unlike Johnny, they manifestly do live in the mind-blowing, heartbreaking great big world.\"]","href_hash":"1aafe7ce489911ecb5381b2632df78e5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1aafe7ce489911ecb5381b2632df78e5"}},
