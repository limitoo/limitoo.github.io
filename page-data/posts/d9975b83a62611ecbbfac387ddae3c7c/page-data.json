This was the first time in the survey's history the varroa mite had been most frequently attributed to colony losses, with queen problems previously being considered the leading cause.\", \"MPI senior scientist Richard Hall said most beekeepers reported that their current varroa treatments were effective, but that they lost colonies if they got the timing of the treatment wrong, under-dosed or picked up varroa from reinvasion from other colonies.\", \"However this year's survey also found not all beekeepers had treated for varroa, he said.\", \"As a result of the survey findings, MPI had begun a collaborative education campaign with the beekeeping industry, to raise awareness on how to tackle varroa mites and other biosecurity threats.\", \"While commercial beekeeper numbers in New Zealand have been dropping, there had been growth in the number of small beekeeping operations and hobbyists. Richard Hall said it was essential those new to the industry were equipped with the best information.\", \"MPI had also funded a new research project to better understand how varroa treatments are used in New Zealand and where gaps in knowledge may be. This research would begin later this year, Dr Hill said.\", \"\\u202f\", \"\\\"This two-pronged work will help them know what biosecurity risks to look out for and how to manage them.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"d9975b83a62611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d9975b83a62611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
