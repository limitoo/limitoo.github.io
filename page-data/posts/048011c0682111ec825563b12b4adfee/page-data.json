And I\\u2019m just going to do everything I can to get better, A.S.A.P., and as soon as I\\u2019m cleared, I\\u2019ll be back onstage.\\u201d\", \"Shortly after Mr. Jackman posted his video, \\u201cThe Music Man\\u201d announced on Instagram that all performances would be canceled through Saturday. Tickets can be refunded or exchanged where they were purchased. Performances will resume on Sunday, and Jackman will return to the show on Jan. 6.\", \"Several other Tony winners star in \\u201cThe Music Man\\u201d alongside Mr. Jackman: Sutton Foster as Marian Paroo, Shuler Hensley as Marcellus Washburn, Jefferson Mays as Mayor Shinn, Jayne Houdyshell as Mrs. Shinn and Marie Mullen as Mrs. Paroo.\", \"Preview performances for \\u201cThe Music Man\\u201d began on Dec. 20, with opening night scheduled for Feb. 10.\", \"The show\\u2019s efforts to stay open had just been highlighted on Thursday night, when the actress Kathy Voytko, a swing and an understudy for Marian Paroo in the musical, filled in for Ms. Foster at the last minute.

She found out at 12 noon today and at 1 o\\u2019clock she had her very first rehearsal as Marian Paroo.\\u201d\", \"As the coronavirus and its Omicron variant spread, understudies and swings are becoming more important than ever: Shows are relying on them to step in for sick or unavailable leads.\", \"\\u201cThis is unprecedented,\\u201d Mr. Jackman continued. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not only happening here at the Winter Garden, but all over Broadway.
