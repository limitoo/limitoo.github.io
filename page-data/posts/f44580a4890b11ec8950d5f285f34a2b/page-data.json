Rather, the move gives Amazon more flexibility to raise some workers' pay in a world where employees feel increasingly empowered to go elsewhere.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"As compensation is unique for each employee (considering their performance, job family, and market conditions), these updates to the base pay cap and the total compensation ranges will affect every employee differently,\\\" the company said in the memo.\", \"The coronavirus pandemic and its fallout has spurred millions of workers to switch jobs or start their own businesses in what's been dubbed the \\\"Great Resignation.\\\" Last year, 47 million people \\u2014 nearly 30% of the U.S. workforce \\u2014 quit their jobs, according to Labor Department data.\", \"The competition is particularly fierce for skilled tech workers. In December, Apple gave many workers surprise six-figure bonuses \\u2014 some as high as $180,000 \\u2014 to prevent employees from decamping for Facebook parent company Meta, which has hired many Apple workers. Google parent Alphabet last month said it would increase four executives' pay to over $1 million, even as it has declined to adjust other workers' pay for inflation, according to The Verge.\", \"According to the New York Times and Insider, Amazon has long capped most corporate employees' base pay at $160,000 \\u2014 far lower than its tech competitors \\u2014 and made up the remainder with generous stock awards. But with its rich stock price growth slowing, the relatively low base pay at Amazon has frustrated many in-demand tech workers, according to reports. More than 50 vice presidents have left in the past year with turnover for VPs rising to 10%, Insider reported.\", \"Employee message boards on Reddit and Blind indicate there's confusion over when and how Amazon's pay increases are set to go into effect, or whether workers will see their future stock grants reduced to make up for higher salaries.\\u00a0\", \"Amazon has been on a hiring spree since the pandemic, and the online-shopping boom it engendered, dramatically\\u00a0boosted its revenue\\u00a0and workplace armies. Its global workforce now stands at 1.6 million, according to the company's latest earnings report. The retail giant's warehouse workers make an average of $15 an hour, with some getting hiring bonuses as high as $3,000.\\u00a0\", \"But rising labor costs are also eating into the company's profits. Amazon recently raised the price of its Prime membership by $20, to $139 a year, partly in response to higher costs.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"f44580a4890b11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f44580a4890b11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
