Brown of Buffalo, an incumbent four-term Democrat, declared victory on Tuesday night in his write-in campaign to defeat his own party\\u2019s official nominee, India Walton. But Ms. Walton refused to concede.\", \"The results were far from final in a race that drew national attention for reflecting the ideological schism in the Democratic Party: With nearly 70 percent of the vote counted, about 60 percent of the votes so far were marked for \\u201cwrite-In,\\u201d and many of those could eventually translate into votes for Brown, though that process of counting will be laborious and could take weeks to finish.\", \"Ms. Walton, a democratic socialist who had earned the endorsements of some of the nation\\u2019s best-known progressives, said on Tuesday night that \\u201cevery vote needs to be counted\\u201d and railed against the Brown campaign, which did not reject support from Republicans, a small cohort in this heavily Democratic city.\", \"\\u201cRight now it\\u2019s \\u2018Walton\\u2019 against \\u2018Write In,\\u2019 whoever that is,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWho Write-In is remains to be seen.\\u201d\", \"Indeed, there is at least one other write-in candidate who has actively campaigned \\u2014 Benjamin Carlisle, a former Democrat. Ballots marked \\u201cwrite-in\\u201d will have to be checked individually to see which candidate \\u2014 Mr. Brown, Mr. Carlisle, or others \\u2014 is indicated. And absentee ballots will not be tallied until mid-November.\", \"Still, the results on Tuesday seemed to boost the hopes and mood of Mr. Brown, who lost to Ms. Walton in a Democratic primary in June, after running a lackluster campaign.\", \"\\u201cThey said it was impossible to win as a write-in, but you can never count a Buffalonian out,\\u201d said Mr. Brown said to a raucous crowd at a downtown event, adding he would find a way to thank all his voters \\u201cover the next four years.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis hasn\\u2019t been easy,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s been worth it.\\u201d\", \"The political oddity of a potent write-in campaign and a battle pitting moderates versus progressives inside the Democratic Party turned this city\\u2019s usually lackluster mayoral race into one of the most closely watched contests in the nation.\", \"Mr. Brown, 63, was seeking a fifth term, trying to cobble together a varied coalition of conservative and moderate Democratic supporters, as well as managing the vicissitudes of a write-in campaign, including spending $100,000 to buy specially made rubber stamps to allow voters to ink his name on ballots.\", \"On Tuesday, such a process didn\\u2019t seem to discourage Brown supporters like Fred Heinle, 66, who voted for the mayor and said, \\u201cByron Brown has done a lot of tremendous things for the city.\", \"\\u201cHas he been perfect? No,\\u201d said Mr. Heinle, who is retired. \\u201cBut he\\u2019s done some wonderful very good things for the city to be proud of.\\u201d\", \"In her remarks, Ms. Walton accused Mr. Brown of betraying the Democratic Party and benefiting from deep-pocketed donors who poured money through independent expenditure committees. And indeed, some local Republican officials \\u2014 who are badly outnumbered in voter registration in Buffalo and did not even field a candidate for mayor \\u2014 did voice support for Mr. Brown\\u2019s campaign.\", \"\\u201cBuffalo is a Democratic city,\\u201d Ms. Walton said on Tuesday night. \\u201cAnd what we have seen is my opponent actively cooperating and colluding with Republicans and dark money to defeat a person who was going to be a champion for the little guy.\\u201d\", \"A win for Mr. Brown \\u2014 the city\\u2019s first Black mayor and a lifelong Democratic centrist \\u2014 would be a stinging rebuke for the progressive wing of his party, which had celebrated Ms. Walton\\u2019s unlikely victory in June.\", \"In many ways, Ms. Walton\\u2019s candidacy has underscored a deeper rift in the Democratic Party, which has seen moderates like President Biden and Eric Adams, who easily won his election for New York City mayor on Tuesday, repeatedly scuffle with more left-leaning candidates and elected officials.\", \"Since winning in June, Ms. Walton had drawn the support of a bevy of prominent national progressives, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, as well as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who represents parts of Queens and the Bronx but traveled to Buffalo in late October to campaign on Ms. Walton\\u2019s behalf.\", \"She had also begun to draw the support of more Democratic establishment figures, including both of the state\\u2019s U.S. senators \\u2014 Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand \\u2014 who could face challengers from the left in future election cycles.\", \"Still, Ms. Walton was not uniformly embraced by state party leadership, as Gov. Kathy Hochul \\u2014 a Buffalo native \\u2014 and Jay S. Jacobs, the chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee, declined to endorse her.\", \"In the closing weeks of the campaign, Mr. Jacobs had come under particular fire after suggesting Ms. Walton\\u2019s win in the primary was akin to an infamous white supremacist, David Duke, winning his party\\u2019s nomination. (Mr. Jacobs, who heard calls for his resignation, later apologized.)\", \"Ms. Walton, 39, was tying to become the first woman and first Black woman to lead New York\\u2019s second largest city, as well as the first socialist to lead a major American city in decades. A first-time candidate, she has an evocative life story as a single mother and labor organizer \\u2014 a narrative that she leaned on in advertisements, some of which were paid for by groups like the Working Families Party, a labor-backed organization that often supports progressive candidates.\", \"She had run an energetic primary campaign, surprising Mr. Brown, who largely refused to acknowledge her candidacy, having won past campaigns comfortably in a city in which Democrats far outnumber Republicans.\", \"The mayor\\u2019s blas\\u00e9 attitude changed radically, however, after Ms. Walton\\u2019s win, as he announced his write-in campaign and attempted a legal push to get himself put on the ballot. That effort failed after a pair of judges ruled against Mr. Brown in September, leaving Ms. Walton the only candidate whose name was on the ballot.\", \"As the campaign continued, political observers here repeatedly suggested that Mr. Brown could be a favorite, if only because of his 16 years in office and widespread name recognition.\", \" But on Tuesday, some of Ms. Walton\\u2019s supporters said they both liked her policies and had tired of Mr. Brown\\u2019s long time in office.\", \"\\u201cNo one is owed a position in public service,\\u201d said Matthew L. Schwartz, 37, social worker in Buffalo. \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand why he feels he has the pulse of the community.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Brown seemed confident in the days before the election, joking on Sunday about the potentially notable nature of his win as well as his rubber stamps.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s a growing feeling,\\u201d he said, \\u201cthat the stamps are going to become collectors\\u2019 items.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e57bc9583c5711ec86a3000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e57bc9583c5711ec86a3000017025a03"}},
