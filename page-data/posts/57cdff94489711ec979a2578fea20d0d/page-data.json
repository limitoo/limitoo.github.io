Mr. de Blasio and some advocates argue that it is inhumane to use horses for transportation in a modern city filled with cars.\", \"Now, as the mayor contemplates a run for governor next year, he has returned to his core campaign issues: In an appearance on MSNBC on Thursday morning, he proposed statewide, year-round, all-day school, a vision that he said would \\u201crevolutionize education in the State of New York.\\u201d\", \"Mr. de Blasio has yet to announce his plan to ban horse-drawn carriages, which would require approval by the City Council, but it has been quietly moving forward. In the emails, city officials said they were aiming to have the legislation ready by Dec. 16, when the City Council is expected to hold its last full meeting of the year.\", \"Danielle Filson, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said he had always wanted to ban horse-drawn carriages and that he hoped the City Council would again consider it.\", \"The mayor\\u2019s office has directed the Economic Development Corporation to contract with a consulting firm, Langan Engineering, to conduct an analysis of the proposal, with a focus on its environmental, transportation, and socioeconomic impacts, according to the emails. The firm\\u2019s managing principal did not respond to requests for comment.\", \"It remains unclear if there is any appetite in the City Council to ban horse-drawn carriages. A spokeswoman for the Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\", \"The City Hall emails do not define \\u201cshow cars,\\u201d but proponents of banning the carriages have previously pushed to replace them with electric-powered vehicles resembling old-time carriages.\", \"This April, New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets, the leading advocates for the ban, retained the lobbying firm Blue Suit Strategies to push Mr. de Blasio to pursue a similar plan, city lobbying records indicate. The organization is paying the firm $7,000 per month.\", \"The group, known as NYCLASS, helped fund a campaign to topple the 2013 mayoral candidacy of Christine Quinn, then the City Council speaker and Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s rival, in part because she did not support a ban on horse carriages. The campaign was credited with helping to undermine the candidacy of Ms. Quinn, who was considered the early front-runner.\", \"In the ensuing years, NYCLASS pushed Mr. de Blasio to fulfill his promise. But efforts to pass legislation went nowhere, including in 2016, when the mayor failed to push through a bill that would have reduced the number of horses on city streets and confined them to Central Park.\", \"The group has gotten involved in more recent political efforts. This year, it supported a super PAC that ran ads targeting Andrew Yang\\u2019s mayoral campaign after Mr. Yang responded \\u201cno\\u201d to a questionnaire asking if he supported efforts \\u201cto strengthen welfare protections and increase the standards of care for New York City\\u2019s carriage horses.\\u201d\", \"And in October, after a grisly collision between a horse and a car, NYCLASS ran roughly $200,000 worth of TV and digital ads calling for the elimination of the industry.\", \"Steve Nislick, the group\\u2019s co-founder, said that New York should follow the example of Guadalajara, Mexico, which replaced horse-drawn carriages with electric vehicles.\", \"\\u201cThe only way these guys can make money is by mistreating these animals,\\u201d Mr. Nislick said. \\u201cWhy should that exist? Someone has to give me the reason why that should exist.\\u201d\", \"Carriage drivers like Christina Hansen deny that the horses are mistreated, and note that the 68 licensed horse carriages make up a local industry on which dozens of families rely.\", \"\\u201cHere we are, in the middle of New York\\u2019s great recovery from the pandemic, the international tourists are coming back, Broadway is reopening, and they\\u2019re coming back and taking carriage rides,\\u201d Ms. Hansen, who has driven a horse-drawn carriage in New York for nine years, said on Thursday morning, the clip-clop of horse\\u2019s hooves in the background.\", \"\\u201cThe Christmas carriage ride is a New York City tradition,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd here you\\u2019ve got Bill de Blasio playing the Grinch.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Hansen also said that the drivers took excellent care of their horses: \\u201cIf there was anything wrong with what we did, I wouldn\\u2019t do it.\\u201d\", \"But that has done little to dissuade Mr. Nislick and Mr. de Blasio.\", \"Mr. Nislick said via a spokesman that Mr. de Blasio had not asked him to help fund his likely bid for governor, and that Mr. Nislick had not donated to that campaign.\"]","href_hash":"57cdff94489711ec979a2578fea20d0d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"57cdff94489711ec979a2578fea20d0d"}},
