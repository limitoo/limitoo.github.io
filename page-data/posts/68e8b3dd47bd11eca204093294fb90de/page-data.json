Last week, I drove seven hours from my home in the East Bay to the California School for the Deaf, Riverside. I was not disappointed.\", \"After a long string of losing seasons, the football team was undefeated and, for the first time in the school\\u2019s history, vying for the division championship. The article I wrote about the team, which is known as the Cubs, was published this week.\", \"When I arrived at the campus, the school\\u2019s ebullient superintendent, Nancy Hlibok Amann, graciously gave me a tour. Through a sign language interpreter she told me about the team\\u2019s coach.\", \"\\u201cHis blood runs pigskin,\\u201d she said of Coach Keith Adams.\", \"That evening Coach Adams and his players pummeled their opponents in the second round of the playoffs. The lopsided result was not a surprise. The Cubs had outscored their opponents, 642-156, during the regular season, lifting the spirits of a community hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.\", \"On Sunday I accompanied the players and coaches to the N.F.L. game between the Los Angeles Chargers and the Minnesota Vikings, where stadium announcers celebrated the Cubs\\u2019 victories. Dressed in their red jerseys, they watched as their faces showed up on the enormous videoboard. Friends texted to say they had seen them on television.\", \"There are many explanations for why the team is doing so well this year \\u2014 the particular cohort of players is very talented, swift and disciplined. And the athletes play hard.\", \"\\u201cI love being physical, the hard hits and the tackles,\\u201d said Tevin Adams, the team\\u2019s quarterback. He is also the coach\\u2019s son.\", \"But what struck me most was how comfortable and confident the players seemed to be together as a deaf team with deaf coaches. It was their world on their terms.\", \"When they were younger and played in hearing leagues, they were often put at nose tackle because the position required less communication. Now they played whatever position suited them best.\", \"\\u201cThey have a very special bond, a chemistry,\\u201d Amann told me. \\u201cThey\\u2019re able to read each other.\\u201d\", \"I asked Laura Edwards, the athletics supervisor at the school, about the longstanding debate over whether deaf children should attend mainstream institutions or all-deaf schools.\", \"Edwards is deaf and was born into a hearing family. She told me that she recently brought an interpreter to a family gathering because she wanted to capture as many conversations as she could.\", \"\\u201cGrowing up as a deaf person I never went to a deaf school,\\u201d Edwards told me. \\u201cIt was a struggle to make friends. It was very lonely.\\u201d\", \"At the Riverside campus, Edwards says she watches deaf students who transferred from mainstream institutions blossom. \\u201cThe communication barrier is eliminated and there is inclusion and social interaction.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cOur student athletes are the same as any other hearing students in terms of physical and mental skills and athletic talents,\\u201d she texted me later. \\u201cThe only difference is they are Deaf.\\u201d\", \"Edwards noted that she had capitalized the word \\u201cDeaf.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not a typo,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe have a culture of our own.\\u201d\", \"Thomas Fuller is the San Francisco bureau chief for The New York Times.\", \"Doing 300 minutes a week of moderate exercise may help ward off cancer.\", \"Twelve wines for Thanksgiving and beyond.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes from June Oberdorfer, who recommends the newly restored covered bridge at the South Yuba River State Park in Nevada County:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.
