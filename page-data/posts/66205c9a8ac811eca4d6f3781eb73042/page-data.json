One of the defining scandals in the N.F.L.\\u2019s pre-merger days was the 1963 suspension of two major stars, the Hall of Famers Paul Hornung of the Green Bay Packers and Alex Karras of the Detroit Lions, for betting on league games and associating with gamblers or \\u201cknown hoodlums.\\u201d\", \"That reluctance only intensified in 1992, when President George H.W. Bush signed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or PASPA, which banned sports wagering in most states, with Nevada being the most notable exemption.\", \"N.F.L. players were prohibited from participating in events that took place at or were sponsored by casinos. The best-known example, perhaps, was when the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo was blocked in 2015 from attending a fantasy football event at a convention center attached to a casino in Las Vegas.\", \"In 2014, Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times supporting efforts to regulate and legalize sports betting. After all, Silver argued, underground sports betting worth an estimated $400 billion annually was already occurring, and times had changed since PASPA was enacted. Lotteries and casinos had become ubiquitous.\", \"The N.F.L. and everyone else took notice.\", \"\\u201cThis was not a light-switch moment \\u2014 this was very slow and very steady,\\u201d said John Holden, a business professor at Oklahoma State University who has written extensively about sports gambling. \\u201cThe N.F.L. watched as the other three leagues jumped, and then the N.F.L. said, OK.\\u201d\", \"Just as important was the fact that two of the most prominent N.F.L. team owners, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots and Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, were early and enthusiastic investors in DraftKings and fantasy sports. And while the N.F.L. challenged New Jersey\\u2019s new sports betting statute in 2012 \\u2014 a case decided by the Supreme Court \\u2014 individual teams signed sponsorship deals with sportsbooks companies, which began spending big on television spots during the N.F.L. season.\", \"Those contradictions were never more evident than in 2017, when the league\\u2019s owners voted overwhelmingly to allow the Raiders to move to Las Vegas from Oakland, Calif., and local officials paid $750 million in construction costs for a new stadium right off the Strip, said David G. Schwartz, an Atlantic City, N.J., native and longtime chronicler of gambling history who is now the ombuds at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.\", \"The seismic change in sports betting, of course, occurred in 2018, when the Supreme Court struck down the 1992 law. States that had anticipated the decision, like New Jersey, got an early jump on sports betting. Leagues and teams became even more emboldened to collaborate with gambling-related businesses, including casinos and betting apps.\", \"\\u201cWhen the world is changing, you want control,\\u201d said Oliver Hahl, a Carnegie Mellon University business professor who has studied sports authenticity and organizational theory.\", \"To be sure, the N.F.L. and other leagues tried to exert more control by arguing, chiefly in statehouses around the country, that there should be some taxes or fees that went to the leagues, and not the sportsbooks. But the leagues have had only limited success, said Chris Grove, a distinguished fellow at U.N.L.V.\\u2019s International Center for Gaming Regulation, and a partner emeritus at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, a research and consulting firm.\", \"More than 30 states have authorized sports wagering since the Supreme Court decision, and California could join them later this year. Meanwhile, New York, where the N.F.L. has its main headquarters, has quickly become the nation\\u2019s largest sports betting market, topping New Jersey, after just four weeks of accepting mobile bets.\", \"\\u201cIn a few short years, the very idea of sports betting has been transformed from a taboo and sub rosa vice into a major business opportunity,\\u201d according to a recent report from MoffettNathanson, a research firm. \\u201cAll the leagues have flipped positions to now embrace sports gambling with exclusive partnerships. Following the money and consumer interest, media companies have struck many deals to align themselves with various sports betting operators.\\u201d\", \"Football is the most popular sport for bettors, and the N.F.L. continues to worry about the integrity of the game. In 2019, the league suspended Josh Shaw, an injured Arizona Cardinals defensive back at the time, for betting on N.F.L. games. And any scandal that ensnares players, coaches or referees on the order of Tim Donaghy, a former N.B.A. referee who went to prison for betting on games, would be devastating.\", \"The N.F.L. has also been under pressure to tackle compulsive gambling behavior. It started a campaign to encourage responsible gambling at the beginning of the current season, through a $6.2 million partnership with the National Council on Problem Gambling.\", \"Still, more controls are needed, especially on in-game sports betting, which feeds into a compulsive gambler\\u2019s desire for more and faster opportunities to bet, said Keith Miller, a professor at Drake University Law School. Miller spoke during a panel Wednesday on the ethics of legal sports gambling organized by Baruch College\\u2019s Zicklin School of Business.\", \"What the N.F.L. and the country should keep in mind, said Holden, who was also on the panel, is the experience of the United Kingdom and Europe, where legal sports betting has been more established: Both have witnessed serious gambling addiction issues.\"]","href_hash":"66205c9a8ac811eca4d6f3781eb73042"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"66205c9a8ac811eca4d6f3781eb73042"}},
