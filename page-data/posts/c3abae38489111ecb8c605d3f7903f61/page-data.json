I called the Bike Whisperer.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-18T17:06:37.000Z","content":"[\"There was a time I loved riding the Hudson River Bikeway, but the metal bollards dotting the path made me phobic. If you\\u2019re wondering when this dark terror took root, I can tell you exactly: The moment I slammed my bike into a metal barrier, shattering my wrist in five places. Some time after that \\u2014 and after a collision with a cement Jersey barrier \\u2014 I reluctantly gave up the Hudson River Bikeway. My once-relaxing path had become an obstacle course. When you\\u2019re in the Medicare zone, falls are serious business.\", \"The great thing about New York, of course, is that there is no phobia for which you cannot find a therapist. My first was an instructor called Lance (really), who built me a set of Styrofoam bollards. I had absolutely no fear of hitting Styrofoam. Unfortunately, after the first lesson, Lance became unavailable.\", \"No matter. There is no shortage of private bike instructors. An online search turned up someone promising, but her fee, for a 90-minute lesson, was a stupefying $475. I quickly moved on to Andr\\u00e9e Sanders, who bills herself as the Bike Whisperer. Her students include those with \\u201cpersonal challenges\\u201d: people who were traumatized when they tried to learn to ride as children; riders intimidated by New York City traffic and congested bikeways; older bikers concerned about falls; someone who was hit by a bus. She\\u2019s never had a client with a fear as specific as mine, but she feels she can help. Her fee is $200.\", \"I meet Andr\\u00e9e, who is 57, in a quiet spot at Riverside Park. She has brought a hybrid bike for me with tires that were double the width of my sporty, 22-year-old Terry road bike. The first thing she does is check my posture and tell me to relax and open my shoulders.\", \"When you bike, you open your heart to the world, Andr\\u00e9e says. This is a little woo-woo for me, but when she explains, I get it: You want your shoulders over your hips, so your center of gravity goes down to the bottom of the bike. That gives you stability, which leads to confidence. You should also be relaxed, so the bike becomes an extension of yourself. Ninety percent of biking is in the mind.\", \"Andr\\u00e9e leads me to a path with two ominous black iron bollards. The moment I see them, my body tenses up. I have a longtime fear of flying, and the way I deal with that is a tablet of Clonazepam and a swallow of vodka. It\\u2019s a bad idea for biking, but I was thinking wistfully of it then.\", \"Andr\\u00e9e sets up a line of orange soccer cones beyond the bollards. Ride through the bollards, she tells me, but focus on the cones. If you look at something, you ride into it.\", \"\\u201cMaybe we could start with something else,\\u201d I say.\", \"Andr\\u00e9e spots another set of bollards, spaced a bit farther apart and overgrown with bushes. I like bushes. They\\u2019re soft. Even so, I have to get up my courage to bike through. My way of dealing with bollards, when I don\\u2019t get off my bike and walk, is to slow down and drop one foot, turning my bike into a scooter. This is a bad habit, Andr\\u00e9e says. Slowing down suddenly makes me a danger to other bikers and makes me unstable. I should also maintain enough speed so that I can coast past a bollard without pedaling.\", \"I\\u2019m still afraid, but with the next try, I manage to keep my feet on the pedals. We ride around the park, finding other spaces to bike through.\", \"\\u201cGood job,\\u201d Andr\\u00e9e yells, like an encouraging mother, though not one I ever had. \\u201cGreat!\\u201d\", \"After this first lesson, I steel myself to go for a ride. The closest uncrowded place for me to practice is East River Park. There is a clearly marked bike lane that goes right there from my apartment. Within four blocks, I encounter a Con Ed crew, two delivery trucks and pedestrians with their eyes on their phones. The obstacles do not seem to bother other bikers: Students, delivery guys, people older than I am all zigzag around me. Some, ignoring the one-way signs, bike straight at me. It is terrifying. I get off my bike and walk, so humiliated I want to cry.\", \"My ride, on an uncrowded path in sweet and scruffy East River Park, does not go well either. I pedal up to the bollards, then stop short, like a show horse refusing a jump. The more I fail, the angrier at myself I become.\", \"\\u201cWadler, you are pathetic,\\u201d I tell myself. \\u201cEverybody in this town can ride but you. You are a cowardly, neurotic, screwed-up mess.\\u201d\", \"Andr\\u00e9e has advised that if I get very tense while practicing, I should take a break. I get off the bike path and take a relaxed ride around a rundown picnic area, where a food delivery guy is hanging out. Off to the side, there are two empty garbage cans.\", \"That\\u2019s it, I can build my own bike barriers! The cans stink, but that makes it an authentic New York experience, and if I hit them, they\\u2019ll bounce more than I will. I hope. I set up the garbage cans to make lane dividers that are wider than the ones on the path but narrow enough to be a challenge. Then I get up my nerve and bike through.\", \"The food delivery guy is now watching me, and he knows what I am trying to do.\", \"\\u201cLook in the distance,\\u201d he yells. \\u201cAnd get up more speed. Don\\u2019t pedal. Just sail through.\\u201d\", \"There is only one thought that goes through your head in a moment like this: \\u201cI bet I could get this guy for a lot less than the Bike Whisperer.\\u201d\", \"I stop.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s just what my bike coach says,\\u201d I tell him. \\u201cHow do you know this stuff?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cDriving through cars,\\u201d the food delivery guy says.\", \"\\u201cI could never do that,\\u201d I tell him. \\u201cI\\u2019m just afraid of metal barriers.\\u201d\", \"I hold up my scarred wrist.\", \"The delivery guy holds up his own arm. It has a scar identical to mine. Then he sticks out his right leg. There is another long scar. Maybe I should stick with Andr\\u00e9e.\", \"New York is a dangerous town. I need to get a more stable bike. I go to a bike store on the Upper East Side. I come away with a Cannondale E-bike with wide, two-inch tires and a step-through design so I can get off fast. Using the power assist, I don\\u2019t have to pedal as hard uphill, which helps eliminates any wobble. I have more control of the bike and feel far more confident. Until Andr\\u00e9e decides that, for the second lesson, we will ride on the actual Hudson Bikeway, the busiest bike path in all of America.\", \"Reclaim it, Andr\\u00e9e tells me when she sees how frightened I am. Close your eyes and visualize your ride.\", \"\\u201cIf I visualize my ride, I see my bones shatter,\\u201d I say.\", \"\\u201cVisualize it the way it was when you loved it,\\u201d Andr\\u00e9e says.\", \"I think about my favorite spot: a heart-shaped cove, just south of the Little Red Lighthouse and the George Washington Bridge, where the Hudson is so close you could wiggle your toes in it. Then, with Andr\\u00e9e yelling encouragement, I follow her through the bollards. I manage to ride through several without pausing. I\\u2019m euphoric.\", \"I expect the next ride, from Little Island to the Battery, to be my victory lap. But as the bollards increase, the old terror kicks in. I am soon unable to do anything but get off the bike and walk through. It\\u2019s the old critical/self-hate cycle. I\\u2019m spending a fortune, trying to beat an absurd phobia, and I\\u2019m failing. Near Battery Park City, I move off the path and scan the area.\", \"\\u201cWhat are you looking for?\\u201d Andr\\u00e9e asks.\", \"\\u201cA wine bar,\\u201d I say, miserably.\", \"The closest equivalent we can find, at just before 11 a.m., is a liquor store. A few patrons are outside, desperately waiting for it to open. One has the tremors of a man with a serious problem.\", \"\\u201cLet\\u2019s get back on the path,\\u201d I tell Andr\\u00e9e.\", \"Reprogramming the brain, it turns out, takes time. Andr\\u00e9e takes photos to show me how much space I have between bollards; she texts encouraging messages. Her lessons are therapy sessions. Compliment yourself, Andr\\u00e9e tells me. We would never criticize other people the brutal way we criticize ourselves.\", \"She also suggests riding to music. I can\\u2019t use an earpiece, which would block out street sound and be unsafe, so I get a small Bluetooth speaker and make a feel-good playlist, heavy on the Beach Boys and Dion & the Belmonts. It takes my mind off falling, but I want something that will really stiffen my resolve. I download the Soviet national anthem sung by the Red Army Chorus, which for me evokes the Battle of Stalingrad, at least as in the movies: When the one with the rifle is killed, the one who is following picks up his gun. If you run, you will be shot.\", \"We all love a cinematic ending, music soaring, the hero\\u2019s arms raised in triumph. I wish I could give it to you, but if I raise my arm going through a bollard I may fall. Even now, riding through, I sometimes wobble. Still, when the weather is fair, you may see me on the path, in my favorite spot near the George Washington Bridge, blasting the Soviet national anthem.\", \"I have retaken the bikeway.\"]","href_hash":"c3abae38489111ecb8c605d3f7903f61"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c3abae38489111ecb8c605d3f7903f61"}},
