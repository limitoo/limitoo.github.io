And they never delivered. We did. And that's a Big F-ing Deal.\\\"\", \"Schiff's use of the phrase \\\"infrastructure week\\\" was in reference to a running joke that emerged during the Trump administration. Trump officials would often note that a given week was themed after \\\"infrastructure,\\\" despite the administration never developing any substantial legislation that gained notable congressional support.\", \"Trump's various \\\"infrastructure weeks\\\" also became notable for how often they were derailed by the former president's scandals.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927771/adam-schiff-biden-infrastructure.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">In the wake of the House of Representatives passing President Joe Biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, Rep.
