The family had recently travelled to Auckland and it's not yet known how their infections are connected to the border.\", \"Red isn't a lockdown and shops, including retail, are still able to open. Despite this, people have flocked to supermarkets desperate to get their hands on essentials.\", \"Photos and videos taken at Countdown LynnMall in Auckland show shelves getting low of toilet paper and paper towels.

This could be through limited staffing numbers, limits to shop hours, and product supply issues.
