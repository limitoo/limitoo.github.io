She coasted to a 20-point win over Todd Kaminsky, a Democratic state senator and former federal prosecutor. And the race to replace the outgoing Democratic county comptroller went to a Republican, Elaine Phillips. \", \"Off-year elections are often hard for the party of the sitting president, but the results defied candidate expectations and bolstered arguments that President Biden\\u2019s unpopularity and the Democratic Party\\u2019s internecine battles were undermining its viability in the suburbs.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s almost like we\\u2019re back temporarily to the \\u201960s and \\u201970s,\\u201d said Lawrence Levy, executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University, referring to a time when Republicans ruled the Nassau County roost. \\u201cThe real question is how long this will last.\\u201d\", \"Four years ago, Democratic voters in Nassau County treated the 2017 election as an early referendum on President Donald J. Trump. They staged postcard-writing campaigns and held living-room fund-raisers, and an energized electorate pushed Ms. Curran to become only the third Democrat in 80 years to be county executive in Nassau.\", \"This year, the roles were reversed: The county has more than a million registered voters; 264,000 showed up and they voted overwhelmingly Republican, seemingly ousting Ms. Curran after one term.\", \"\\u201cThere was a wave, there\\u2019s no doubt about it, even for an unapologetically pro-business, pro-public safety Democrat,\\u201d Ms. Curran said in an interview, referring to herself.\", \"In conversations with more than a dozen Nassau County voters this week, they cited their overall disapproval of the president, their distaste for vaccine mandates and a fear of funds being diverted from the police as factors in their decision to vote Republican. Concerns over Mr. Biden\\u2019s handling of Israel also arose several times.\", \"Among those voting Republican was Audrey Alleva, a 64-year-old Garden City resident with family in the military, who cited the president\\u2019s performance as a factor in her decision.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t like the way President Biden handled the country leaving Afghanistan,\\u201d Ms. Alleva said.\", \"Sam Liviem, a 70-year-old Great Neck resident, cited other recent Democratic pushes as reason to cast his ballot for Republicans.\", \"\\u201cWhen liberals try to push \\u2018defund the police,\\u2019 when they try to take down statues of people from the past, when they want to wipe out history, you are going back to the law of the jungle,\\u201d Mr. Liviem said.\", \"Nassau County was recently ranked the safest county in the United States by U.S. News and World Report. But the Nassau Republican Party exploited fears about crime to drive voters to the polls, particularly in the case of Mr. Kaminsky, who supported changes in state bail laws that Republicans blame for the county\\u2019s recent rise in shootings, which have increased across the country during the pandemic.\", \"In 2019, New York State curtailed bail for many nonviolent defendants, who might otherwise have stayed in pretrial detention because they could not pay. But law enforcement authorities argued the law was overly broad and faulted it for not granting judges more discretion to detain defendants they considered a risk to public safety.\", \"Mr. Kaminsky supported the original bail reform bill. And, in a video of the 2019 Senate proceedings widely circulated by the Donnelly campaign, the senate deputy majority leader, Michael Gianaris, explicitly thanks four senators, including Mr. Kaminsky, for their support. That vote came to haunt Mr. Kaminsky during his campaign.\", \"Though Mr. Kaminsky vastly outspent Ms. Donnelly on advertising that tried to portray him as a tough-on-crime former prosecutor \\u2014 her campaign spent more than $800,000 on television and online ads, according to the state Board of Elections, while his spent about $1.3 million as of mid-October \\u2014 the Donnelly campaign\\u2019s message stuck.\", \"In one ad, the Donnelly campaign recruited the mother of a shooting victim from Syracuse. \\u201cSenator Todd Kaminsky helped write the law that set my daughter\\u2019s killer free,\\u201d says the mother, Jennifer Payne, who also appeared in a 2020 ad for Representative John Katko, a Republican from central New York.\", \"In another Donnelly ad, viewers were met by ominous music and the mustachioed visage of John Wighaus, the president of the Nassau County Detectives Association, who held Mr. Kaminsky responsible for the release of \\u201ckillers, rapists and violent thugs.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI think crime was on everybody\\u2019s mind, I think bail reform was on everyone\\u2019s mind,\\u201d Ms. Donnelly said in an interview. She noted that concerns about crime in New York City, which bolstered the election of Eric Adams as mayor, played a role in Nassau.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a regional issue,\\u201d Ms. Donnelly said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a countrywide issue.\\u201d \", \"Ms. Donnelly will be the county\\u2019s first Republican district attorney originally elected as a Republican since William Cahn in the 1960s, said Joseph Cairo, the county Republican chairman. (Denis Dillon, who served as Nassau County district attorney for three decades, was elected as a Democrat before switching to the Republican Party in the 1980s.)\", \"Ms. Curran argued anxiety about criminal justice issues seeped into her race, too.\", \"\\u201cThis bail reform issue was very motivating to voters,\\u201d said Ms. Curran, who tried to distance herself from the bail legislation by appearing on \\u201cFox and Friends\\u201d to decry the new law as an overreach.\", \"If state and national political issues inflamed the debate in Nassau County, local issues proved potent, too.\", \"Ms. Curran\\u2019s opponent, Mr. Blakeman, focused his campaign almost exclusively on county taxes, even incorporating \\u201ccut Nassau taxes\\u201d into the URL for his campaign website.\", \"For eight years before Ms. Curran\\u2019s ascension to county executive in 2018, her predecessor had frozen property assessments for tax purposes. Upon taking office, Ms. Curran began a process to rework a tax system she called \\u201ccorrupt.\\u201d But after the reassessments, 65 percent of Nassau County homeowners saw higher taxes, according to a report in Newsday, and Ms. Curran\\u2019s opponents seized on anger about those tax increases.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s some terrible news coming in the mail: It\\u2019s your school tax bill,\\u201d Mr. Blakeman said in one ad. \\u201cLaura Curran\\u2019s reassessment has caused property taxes to soar two years in a row. Curran\\u2019s tax hikes will continue for three more years, unless we stop her.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cA lot of people, their school tax bill went up by thousands and thousands of dollars, and I think that was a major issue,\\u201d Mr. Blakeman said in an interview.\", \"Even in the Democratic bastion of North Hempstead, which has in recent years seen an influx of more politically conservative Iranian Jews, the Republican candidate for a seat on the County Legislature, Mazi Melesa Pilip, was leading the Democratic incumbent, Ellen Birnbaum, by more than 15 points. The supervisor of the town of North Hempstead may soon be a Republican, too.\", \"All that being said, Democrats continued to take refuge in the notion that they were part of something bigger than themselves, a Republican tide of unusually sweeping proportions.\", \"\\u201cWhat happened in Nassau County happened in lots of places \\u2014 Suffolk County, upstate New York, Virginia, New Jersey,\\u201d said Jay Jacobs, the chair of the Nassau County and state Democrats. \\u201cWhat happened was Republican voters overperformed dramatically and Democratic voters underperformed.\\u201d\", \"But Jovanni Ortiz, the founder of the South Shore Democrats, laid just as much blame at the feet of Mr. Jacobs.\", \"Mr. Ortiz argued that Mr. Jacobs failed to galvanize voters \\u2014 particularly in Nassau County communities of color, in part by failing to get out the vote on Democratic ballot questions that would have made it easier for New Yorkers to vote. He has called on Mr. Jacobs to resign.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s kind of putting it on national issues, which I agree are part of the reason for some of the results,\\u201d Mr. Ortiz said. \\u201cBut for him to not recognize that part of this is on him is a little bit crazy.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"99ec938a407d11eca1cfd1f07a37391c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"99ec938a407d11eca1cfd1f07a37391c"}},
