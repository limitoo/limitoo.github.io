New factories are opening, the Detroit Pistons basketball team moved back from the suburbs, and young college graduates have moved into downtown and Midtown, along with businesses catering to them.\", \"\\u201cEight years ago, the problems Detroit was facing were just Detroit \\u2014 no other city was talking about bankruptcy or streetlights,\\u201d Mr. Duggan said earlier this year. \\u201cToday, the challenges that we\\u2019re dealing with, every other city has.\\u201d\", \"But by Mr. Duggan\\u2019s own assessment, Detroit remains a work in progress. Violent crime is a persistent concern. Blighted and abandoned homes are a common sight, despite efforts to bulldoze or restore many buildings over the last decades. And some longtime residents, especially Black residents who stayed in Detroit through years of white flight to the suburbs, say they are concerned about gentrification as the white population grows and rents go up.\", \"Mr. Duggan, the first white mayor in decades of a city where nearly 80 percent of residents are Black, has also so far failed to deliver on his promise to end more than half a century of population decline. Data from the 2020 census showed the population had fallen more than 10 percent since 2010, to about 639,000 residents. The white, Asian and Hispanic populations increased in that period, but there were tens of thousands fewer Black Detroiters in the city. The mayor has disputed that data and pledged to challenge the census figures.\", \"Mr. Duggan\\u2019s opponent, Anthony Adams, a lawyer and fellow Democrat, focused his campaign on crime reduction, police reform and keeping longtime residents in the city. But he struggled to gain traction as local and national figures in the Democratic Party, including President Biden, gave their support to Mr. Duggan.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re starting to lose our Black population in the city, and we\\u2019re losing it because the policies of this administration are harmful to the people who have been here through thick and thin,\\u201d Mr. Adams said in an interview this summer.\"]","href_hash":"ec528f2c3c4911ec8254000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ec528f2c3c4911ec8254000017025a03"}},
