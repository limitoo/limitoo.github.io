Wiry gray hair, deep lines carved into a scowl, teeth that could have belonged to George Washington, and a black T-shirt that hugged a barrel-chested frame.\\u201d\", \"Grohl made a choice on the spot about which path he would take as an aging rock star. \\u201cI would aspire to become the rusted-out hot rod, no matter how many jump-starts I might require along the way.\\u201d\", \"Every musician faces some version of this decision. If you do manage to get to the top of the charts, how do you stay there? What does it take to create a career out of making noise, and what might that look and sound like? A batch of new books addresses these questions from a variety of perspectives.\", \"Grohl\\u2019s breezy, amiable memoir certainly shores up his place as the best-liked guy in rock \\u2019n\\u2019 roll. He\\u2019s smart and self-deprecating, and never strays from his position as a fan, first and foremost. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to put into words the belief that I have in music,\\u201d he writes. \\u201cTo me, it is god. A divine mystery in whose power I will forever hold an unconditional trust.\\u201d\", \"As its title indicates, \\u201cThe Storyteller\\u201d is a series of anecdotes, taking us from the singer/songwriter/guitarist/drummer\\u2019s childhood in suburban Virginia through his discovery of punk rock, ascension to superstardom with Nirvana, and formation and leadership of Foo Fighters, who were just inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Along the way, of course, high jinks ensue \\u2014 backing up Iggy Pop as a fledgling punk drummer, singing for former President George W. Bush, listening in while Paul McCartney gives Grohl\\u2019s daughter her first piano lesson.\", \"The challenge for Grohl is that he has been so prolific across so many different media that some stories and themes are already familiar to his fans: We\\u2019ve heard about his devotion to the bonding power of \\u201cvan tours\\u201d in a couple of documentaries, his work in (and acquisition of the audio board from) the historic Sound City studios in another project \\u2014 even his deep bond with his mother was the basis for a TV series.\", \"The Nirvana years don\\u2019t occupy a lot of space in \\u201cThe Storyteller,\\u201d but they\\u2019re inevitably the emotional core of Grohl\\u2019s tale. Processing the group\\u2019s stratospheric success \\u2014 \\u201cthe rickety carnival ride that had once been our little group started spinning faster and faster\\u201d \\u2014 will be a lifelong effort, but some of the most powerful moments are the most specifically musical.\", \"\\u201cI could always tell when a chorus was coming by watching Kurt\\u2019s dirty Converse sneaker as it moved closer and closer to the distortion pedal,\\u201d writes Grohl, \\u201cand just before he stomped on the button, I would blast into a single-stroke snare roll with all of my might, like a fuse burning fast into the heart of a bomb, signaling the change.\\u201d\", \"A few punch lines get repeated, and some characters are introduced only to be identified a few pages later, but you gotta give a little punk-rock latitude to a guy who proudly boasts about his love for Legos and that he still dresses \\u201cthe same way I did in ninth grade.\\u201d As for the unlikely places Grohl has found himself as rock\\u2019s leading ambassador, he says that at a certain point, \\u201cI decided to stop asking \\u2018How did I get here?\\u2019 I was there.\\u201d\", \"Grohl managed to successfully make the transition from member of a group to leader of his own band, a jump that Stevie Van Zandt was never really able to pull off. Instead, as he chronicles in UNREQUITED INFATUATIONS: A Memoir (Hachette, 416 pp., $31), the E Street Band guitarist has shape-shifted over the years in unpredictable ways, from producer to actor to activist.\", \"Van Zandt is a man of passion \\u2014 born with \\u201csome genetic penchant for metaphysical zealotry\\u201d \\u2014 which gets him in and out of trouble throughout his life. Religiously devout as a child, he transfers that conviction to music after discovering the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Soon, he and Bruce Springsteen start circling each other at the Jersey Shore Battles of the Bands and in Greenwich Village clubs; it takes years for them to settle into a steady working relationship, as Springsteen experiments with various groups and musical identities.\", \"What Van Zandt realizes, which guides the rest of his career, is that his true gift is in analyzing and deconstructing music, seeing the big picture. The consistently surprising \\u201cUnrequited Infatuations\\u201d is filled with lists and rules, efforts to comprehend and explain what makes a great record or an important artist. He becomes Springsteen\\u2019s consigliere, the guy who handles the plans and the details \\u2014 a position that, of course, later informed his role as Silvio Dante on \\u201cThe Sopranos.\\u201d\", \"Trouble is, when Van Zandt\\u2019s unswerving vision (some might say stubbornness?) clashes with Springsteen and his team, he leaves E Street only to find limited interest in his work with his own band; tough breaks, bad timing or just the magic needed to connect all the dots keeps him playing at a club level. So, even after returning to the Springsteen fold, he finds other outlets for those raging passions \\u2014 a radio show, a crusade to teach rock history in schools and (seemingly out of nowhere) newfound stardom on television.\", \"Most dramatic on this whole wild ride, though, is Van Zandt\\u2019s valiant work fighting apartheid in South Africa. The most visible result was the \\u201cSun City\\u201d benefit single \\u2014 easily the best of the all-star charity records in the 1980s \\u2014 but he describes some harrowing meetings negotiating with machete-wielding revolutionaries in Soweto (\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t important enough to kill\\u201d). I guess if you\\u2019ve survived those late-night audiences down the Shore, you don\\u2019t scare easy.\", \"Other kinds of survival \\u2014 for the artist, the music and the listeners \\u2014 run through BESSIE SMITH: A Poet\\u2019s Biography of a Blues Legend (Vintage, 224 pp., paper, $16.95), the first American edition of a 1997 biography by the Scottish poet Jackie Kay. The book lays out the contours of the life of the \\u201cEmpress of the Blues,\\u201d while exploring her resonance for the author; Smith\\u2019s music was \\u201cthe first awareness of myself being black. I\\u2019d only ever think about it if something reminded me. Bessie Smith always reminded me.\\u201d\", \"Powerful, bold and larger than life, Smith had dozens of groundbreaking hits in the 1920s, pioneering songs that raised issues of race, class and sexuality, defining new vocal territory later explored by singers from Billie Holiday to Nina Simone while fighting for respect and recognition both personally and professionally. \\u201cThe blues that Bessie sang often strangely anticipated her life,\\u201d writes Kay. \\u201cSo many of the tragedies she sang about actually happened to her after she sang the songs and not before; she didn\\u2019t just sing songs that reflected her own experience, she sang songs about experiences that were lying in wait for her, further on down that old blues road. Her blues were premonitions.\\u201d\", \"Kay didn\\u2019t know these stories when she first heard Smith\\u2019s records as an adopted child, one who saw nobody nearby who looked like her. Her evocative language and kaleidoscopic style retains that wonder even as she researches Smith\\u2019s life. \\u201cI will always keep the imaginary Bessie that I had from my childhood. I have partly made her up from there on.\\u201d\", \"Nowhere is this more true than in the mythic circumstances surrounding Smith\\u2019s death in 1937. Legend has it that she died when injuries she incurred in a car accident went untreated because the nearest hospital refused to admit Black patients. A closer look reveals that this may not exactly have been the case. Yet \\u201cthe fact that it maybe didn\\u2019t happen to her is not the point. People believed it had. And in a strange way this is fitting.\\u201d For Kay, Bessie Smith\\u2019s life \\u201ccombines truth and lies so expertly that for years people couldn\\u2019t tell one from the other, and that is why she remains so fascinating.\\u201d\", \"Will future generations discover John Lurie? It\\u2019s not entirely clear whether his contemporaries did. On the one hand, The New Yorker dubbed the musician/actor/painter the \\u201cHumphrey Bogart of the Eighties\\u201d and British Vogue voted him one of the best-dressed men of the 20th Century. On the other, while his band, the Lounge Lizards, drew the attention of John Lennon, Bob Dylan and David Bowie, it struggled to get a record deal.\", \"THE HISTORY OF BONES: A Memoir (Random House, 448 pp., $28), which Lurie has been working on for at least a dozen years, is a picaresque roller coaster of a story, with staggering amounts of sex and drugs and the perpetual quest to retain some kind of artistic integrity. It also documents the East Village of the late \\u201970s and early \\u201980s, a time and place where \\u201cnobody was doing what they actually knew how to do. All the painters had bands. All the musicians were making little movies.\\u201d\", \"Lurie grew up in Worcester, Mass., which he describes as \\u201ca horrible place\\u201d that \\u201chas a dome over it so that God is not allowed in.\\u201d But like something out of a twisted fairy tale, one night at 4 a.m., \\u201ca man with a wheelbarrow gave me my first saxophone.\\u201d Lurie finds his way to crime-infested downtown Manhattan, where he practices his instrument in the subway station and gradually assembles the Lounge Lizards, dressing in thrift-store suits and dubbing his music \\u201cfake jazz,\\u201d which he eventually comes to regret. \\u201cWe were powerful, smart, energetic, confident, egocentric, and astoundingly na\\u00efve,\\u201d he writes. \\u201cNothing outside of our 14-block radius mattered.\\u201d\", \"While he fought to keep the band going, Lurie was also watching some of his associates become cultural icons. He had a complicated, competitive friendship with the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, who for a time was sleeping on Lurie\\u2019s floor. His relationship with the film director Jim Jarmusch is especially fraught: Lurie spitballs the idea for the film \\u201cStranger Than Paradise,\\u201d only to play a starring role but see the director minimize his input. The hard feelings have not subsided: \\u201cI feel like I have to hurry up and get this book published before Jim Jarmusch gets hold of it and puts it out as his own memoir.\\u201d\", \"Lurie, who most recently surfaced with the enigmatic HBO series \\u201cPainting With John,\\u201d claims that he tried to hold himself back from kvetching about everyone who did him wrong (\\u201cthey are just such unpleasant stories, I didn\\u2019t want to write them and can\\u2019t imagine who would want to read them\\u201d), but his examples of the ways artists are ripped off, disrespected and set up to fail are frequent and brutal. The standard he sets, though, is high and pure. \\u201cI would never have said this out loud to anyone,\\u201d he writes, \\u201cbut my life goal was to find and express God through music.\\u201d\", \"That whole principles-versus-commerce showdown is, of course, the defining issue for the music and culture known as punk. And for youth in America, punk doesn\\u2019t really mean the music born in the 1970s \\u2014 the Ramones, Sex Pistols, Clash variety \\u2014 but the more adolescent and melodic translation that came in the \\u201990s with bands like Green Day, the Offspring and Blink-182.\", \"Dan Ozzi\\u2019s SELLOUT: The Major-Label Feeding Frenzy That Swept Punk, Emo, and Hardcore, 1994-2007 (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 416 pp., $28) tracks the stories of 11 bands from that era balancing oppositional independence and mainstream success. The timing couldn\\u2019t be better: So-called pop punk is a dominant influence in music right now, with current hitmakers like Olivia Rodrigo and Machine Gun Kelly, and even introspective \\u201cemo rappers,\\u201d echoing the style.\", \"Nirvana may have kicked in the door, but following Kurt Cobain\\u2019s death, grunge quickly reached its sell-by date; it would be Green Day\\u2019s \\u201cDookie\\u201d album, which sold 20 million copies in 1994, that ultimately cast a longer shadow. Their story opens \\u201cSellout\\u201d and lays out the basic tension built into American punk: As soon as they get too big for their local independent label, and get scooped up by a major record company, they\\u2019re branded as traitors and banned from the San Francisco club that\\u2019s the headquarters of their scene.\", \"As Blink-182\\u2019s Mark Hoppus puts it when describing his own band making this same choice, \\u201cIf we are making the music we want to make and playing the shows we want to play, and we\\u2019re not being told by anybody what to do or how to act, then how can we possibly be selling out?\\u201d Oh, but if only it were that simple. \\u2026\", \"Ozzi\\u2019s reporting is strong, balanced and well told. There are no (well, very few) clear-cut good guys and bad guys. If the band-by-band structure sometimes limits the ability to look at the bigger picture, it still represents a worthy successor to its obvious inspiration, Michael Azerrad\\u2019s 2001 examination of the \\u201980s indie underground, \\u201cOur Band Could Be Your Life.\\u201d The additional challenges facing the Donnas and the Distillers, bands made up of or fronted by women, remain bracing, and the inherent difficulties of maintaining a group\\u2019s focus as its circumstances change are timeless.\", \"The band At the Drive-In, from El Paso, seemed like a can\\u2019t-miss blend of hooky songs and explosive performances, but personality conflicts, business curveballs and the pressure of maintaining momentum proved too much. They broke up six months after their acclaimed debut album came out in 2000. \\u201cMaybe it was always supposed to be that way,\\u201d says one band member. \\u201cIt was just like the live show: It was chaos for forty-five minutes, and then it was over.\\u201d\", \"And then there are the artists who never get the chance to think about a career because they\\u2019re gone too soon. Aaliyah was only 22 when her plane crashed after a video shoot in the Bahamas, but Kathy Iandoli\\u2019s biography BABY GIRL: Better Known as Aaliyah (Atria, 320 pp., $27) is a reminder of how much she accomplished in her short life. Three multiplatinum albums (with a dozen Top 10 R&B singles), lead roles in two major motion pictures and a stint as the face of a Tommy Hilfiger campaign is a lot of work over just a few years.\", \"But Aaliyah Dana Haughton was more than just her track record; her fans deeply identified with this young woman, who demonstrated a look, style and attitude that was all her own. If it seems excessive when Iandoli describes the singer as \\u201cincomprehensibly magical,\\u201d she explains up front that she herself felt a strong \\u201cimaginary friendship\\u201d with Aaliyah.\", \"There\\u2019s an overwhelming sense of unrealized potential in the story of a girl raised in Detroit who kept attending high school after her initial success, graduating with a 4.0 G.P.A. and dreamed of going to Spelman College, who told Teen People that \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna get someone who\\u2019s affable, who\\u2019s nice; but you\\u2019re not gonna get the whole picture of Aaliyah for a while.\\u201d Aaliyah\\u2019s futuristic, hip-hop-inflected R&B was the perfect vessel for the visionary writing and producing team helmed by Timbaland and Missy Elliott, and she even discussed working with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.\", \"But Aaliyah\\u2019s name will unfortunately always be linked to two horrors, which frame Iandoli\\u2019s narrative \\u2014 her relationship with R. Kelly as a young teenager and her all-too-avoidable death. Her name was back in the headlines with Kelly\\u2019s recent conviction for sex trafficking and racketeering; it has long been known that he falsified Aaliyah\\u2019s age when they were married in 1994 (she was 15 but listed as 18). Meanwhile, the list of criminal decisions and bad judgment around her final flight \\u2014 the pilot wasn\\u2019t approved to fly the plane, which was overloaded by 700 pounds \\u2014 is harrowing. These disasters should not be allowed to define Aaliyah\\u2019s life, which Iandoli\\u2019s book (despite some sloppy editing and clich\\u00e9d language) goes a long way toward correcting.\", \"The good news is that the story has changed even since \\u201cBaby Girl\\u201d was published. Aaliyah\\u2019s music, which had been kept off of all streaming services because of conflicts between her family and her label, was recently made available for everyone to hear again. And that\\u2019s the wild card in any consideration of a musician\\u2019s career \\u2014 as long as new audiences are listening, the story isn\\u2019t over.\"]","href_hash":"9a0686ea542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9a0686ea542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}},
