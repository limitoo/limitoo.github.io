Many are still trying to get back home, after the West's counterattack \\u2014 in the form of international sanctions \\u2014 left them cashless.\", \"As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports, with so many flights to Russia cancelled, there's no easy way for Russians to return before their money runs out.\", \"Thousands of Russians are stranded in the popular tourist destination of Phuket, in Thailand. Palmer met some of them, and says the tropical beaches and turquoise seas don't look much like paradise when you're running out of money, with no way home.\", \"Max Kiselyo is one of the Russians who has been trapped in Phuket by the fallout from his president's war in Ukraine.
