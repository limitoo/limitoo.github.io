Its language is intensely gender-specific and fiercely protected by august authorities. Still, the furor provoked by a prominent dictionary\\u2019s inclusion of the pronoun \\u201ciel\\u201d has been remarkably virulent.\", \"Le Petit Robert, rivaled only by the Larousse in linguistic authority, chose to add \\u201ciel\\u201d \\u2014 a gender-neutral merging of the masculine \\u201cil\\u201d (he) and the feminine \\u201celle\\u201d (she) \\u2014 to its latest online edition. Jean-Michel Blanquer, the education minister, was not amused.\", \"\\u201cYou must not manipulate the French language, whatever the cause,\\u201d he said, expressing support for the view that \\u201ciel\\u201d was an expression of \\u201cwokisme.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Blanquer is seemingly convinced of a sweeping American \\u201cwoke\\u201d assault on France aimed at spreading racial and gender discord over French universalism. Last month he told the daily Le Monde that a backlash against what he called woke ideology was the main factor in the 2016 victory of Donald J. Trump.\", \"In this instance, however, he was joined by Brigitte Macron, the first lady. \\u201cThere are two pronouns: he and she,\\u201d she declared. \\u201cOur language is beautiful. And two pronouns are appropriate.\\u201d\", \"The Robert defines \\u201ciel\\u201d (pronounced roughly \\u201cyell\\u201d) as \\u201ca third person subject pronoun in the singular and plural used to evoke a person of any gender.\\u201d\", \"Charles Bimbenet, its director-general, posted a statement rejecting the minister\\u2019s charge of militancy. \\u201cThe mission of the Robert is to observe the evolution of a French language that is in motion and diverse, and take account of that,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cTo define the words that describe the world is to aid better comprehension of it.\\u201d\", \"France, a country where it is illegal for the state to compile racial statistics, is particularly on edge over the rise of American gender and race politics. President Emmanuel Macron has warned that \\u201ccertain social science theories entirely imported from the United States\\u201d may be a threat. Mr. Blanquer has identified \\u201can intellectual matrix\\u201d in American universities bent on undermining a supposedly colorblind French society of equal men and women through the promotion of identity-based victimhood.\", \"This is the backdrop to the \\u201ciel\\u201d explosion, which the left-wing newspaper Lib\\u00e9ration described under the headline \\u201cThe Highway to Iel.\\u201d\", \"Neologisms like \\u201cantivax\\u201d and \\u201cpasse sanitaire\\u201d (health pass) do enter the lexicon with some regularity, but the Acad\\u00e9mie fran\\u00e7aise, founded in 1634 to protect the French language, remains a vigilant guardian of linguistic purity against what one member called \\u201cbrainless Globish\\u201d a couple of years ago.\", \"Lilian Delhomme, 24, a gender-nonconforming student of international affairs at the University of Paris 8 who has been using the pronoun \\u201ciel\\u201d for about a year, was appalled by Ms. Macron\\u2019s statement.\", \"\\u201cThis for me was very violent,\\u201d Mx. Delhomme said in an interview. \\u201cComing from the first lady, from a woman, from a French teacher, from someone whose relationship went against many societal norms, it made me lose hope.\\u201d\", \"Mx. Delhomme was referring to the fact that the relationship between Ms. Macron, 68, and Mr. Macron, 43, began in high school when he was a teenager and she was his drama teacher, married with three children.\", \"Explaining the decision to switch to \\u201ciel,\\u201d Mx. Delhomme said: \\u201cLife was difficult enough being gay, and I didn\\u2019t want to add to that, but gradually I evolved, and I understood that my identity was not that of a man.\\u201d\", \"This year, Mx. Delhomme informed fellow students and faculty of the new pronoun preference. To little avail. \\u201cEveryone still calls me \\u2018he,\\u2019 which is pretty disappointing for political science students,\\u201d said Mx. Delhomme, whose professor asked, \\u201cWhat on earth is that?\\u201d when Mx. Delhomme used \\u201ciel\\u201d on a r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9.\", \"For some time, a movement for \\u201cinclusive writing\\u201d has battled the linguistic establishment in France. It is broadly an attempt to wean the French language of its male bias, including the rule that when it comes to the choice of pronouns for groups of women and men, the male form takes precedence over the female; and when it comes to adjectives describing mixed gatherings, they take the masculine form.\", \"The Acad\\u00e9mie rebuffed such attempts earlier this year. Its secretary-in-perpetuity, H\\u00e9l\\u00e8ne Carr\\u00e8re d\\u2019Encausse, said that inclusive writing, even if it seemed to bolster a movement against sexist discrimination, \\u201cis not only counterproductive for that cause but harmful to the practice and intelligibility of the French language.\\u201d\", \"Gwena\\u00eblle Perrier, who teaches gender studies at the University of Paris 13, said that the sacredness of the French language had become an acceptable terrain on which to take on feminism now that others were frowned upon.\", \"\\u201cTo attack inclusive writing, and the pronoun \\u2018iel\\u2019, is an easy way for anti-feminists to express themselves,\\u201d she said. \\u201cMuch more discreet than attacking women or trans people directly.\\u201d\", \"Fran\\u00e7ois Jolivet, a center-right lawmaker, has led the campaign against the Robert\\u2019s decision to admit \\u201ciel\\u201d to its dictionary. He wrote to the Acad\\u00e9mie fran\\u00e7aise demanding that it take up the matter.\", \"\\u201cIf you have not already done so, this choice of the Petit Robert will become the mark of the entry into our language of so-called \\u2018inclusive\\u2019 writing, and will no doubt be the precursor of the advent of woke ideology that is destructive of our values,\\u201d he wrote.\", \"Mr. Jolivet continued: \\u201cThe solitary campaign of the Petit Robert is a manifest ideological intrusion that undermines our shared language and its influence. This kind of initiative results in a defiled language which divides its users rather than unites them.\\u201d\", \"In an interview, Mr. Jolivet argued that when \\u201cyou legitimize words, you legitimize thoughts.\\u201d He added: \\u201cThese Robert lexicographers are introducing a word that barely exists in our country. That is militancy, that is not doing their jobs.\\u201d\", \"Describing himself as a tolerant man convinced that \\u201ciel\\u201d was the wrong battle, he said that France was now the preferred target of what he called \\u201cpromoters of woke culture.\\u201d France, he insisted, will never accept that human beings be corralled into sectarian communities, be they of race or gender.\", \"\\u201cHere, we have universalism,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe intimate inner self must never take precedence over the individual as a member of the collectivity that is the nation.\\u201d\", \"The problem with this argument is that the French model, as interpreted by Mr. Jolivet, appears to \\u201ccorral\\u201d citizens into certain binary gender identities by denying that other possibilities exist.\", \"Most Americans would be astonished to discover that what Mr. Jolivet called the woke movement \\u2014 which he described as an insult to everyone else who is \\u201csupposedly asleep\\u201d \\u2014 is really about attacking France. Equally, few French people outside a bubble of universities, media and politics ever discuss \\u201cle wokisme\\u201d or preferred pronouns in their daily lives.\", \"Still, at a time when the State Department has issued its first United States passport with an X gender marker for nonbinary, intersex and gender-nonconforming persons, the outcry over \\u201ciel\\u201d suggests how sensitive France and America have become over their divergent approaches to gender and race.\", \"The differences are not only international. The Larousse dictionary derided the Robert initiative, dismissing \\u201ciel\\u201d as a \\u201cpseudo pronoun.\\u201d\", \"Bernard Cerquiglini, a lexicographer at Larousse, told the newspaper Le Figaro that \\u201cpronouns have not changed since the fourth century.\\u201d As for the masculine form, \\u201cit plays a generic role, that\\u2019s just the way it is, and has been since vulgate Latin.\\u201d\", \"It is unclear where the Robert-Larousse standoff will lead, or what the Acad\\u00e9mie fran\\u00e7aise might do. Meanwhile, Mr. Blanquer, the education minister, is not about to use the nonbinary pronoun.\", \"As he told the French National Assembly in 2017, \\u201cThere is only one French language, only one grammar, and only one Republic.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"7848df32506c11ecb4ff9f6aead3dfc7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7848df32506c11ecb4ff9f6aead3dfc7"}},
