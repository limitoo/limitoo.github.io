Mixing antsy chimes and a low-slung beat below, \\u201cPillar III\\u201d builds in force before collapsing in ferocious shudders, explosions and shivers \\u2014 and an ominous lullaby coda. ZACHARY WOOLFE\", \"The pianist Vikingur Olafsson has released another fascinating album, this one offering works by Mozart alongside pieces by his contemporaries Domenico Cimarosa, Baldassare Galuppi, Haydn and Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. Olafsson\\u2019s lucid and intense account of this Bach rondo is especially exhilarating. ANTHONY TOMMASINI\", \"Piotr Anderszewski\\u2019s strange, ultimately satisfying selection of half the preludes and fugues from Book Two of \\u201cThe Well-Tempered Clavier\\u201d might well be one of the great Bach recordings \\u2014 in no way more so than in the psychological depths it charts in the slowest of its fugues. Anderszewski\\u2019s is playing of almost heroic concentration, and profound humanity. DAVID ALLEN\", \"A tour of Bluebeard\\u2019s home is the stuff of HGTV nightmares. His new wife, Judith, should beware what lies behind each locked door, but fatefully insists on opening them. The fourth reveals a secret garden \\u2014 rendered vividly in this recording, a master class in orchestral coloring and texture. Because the tension never truly slackens in Susanna Malkki\\u2019s interpretation, even a moment of fleeting beauty is shaded with nervous anticipation. JOSHUA BARONE\", \"There\\u2019s suave Gershwin on Isata Kanneh-Mason\\u2019s most recent album, as well as elegant Samuel Barber and moving Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, including a heated yet heartbreakingly dignified \\u201cDeep River.\\u201d But Amy Beach\\u2019s \\u201cBy the Still Waters\\u201d was new to me, and Kanneh-Mason makes of it a dreamy, unhurried little masterpiece. ZACHARY WOOLFE\", \"After a bland Tchaikovsky Fourth and a finicky Beethoven Ninth, I had started to wonder whether Manfred Honeck and the Pittsburgh Symphony were getting a little too invested in their innovative approach to the canonical repertoire for their own good. This furious Brahms Fourth dispels those doubts; at times, the orchestral playing is barely believable. DAVID ALLEN\", \"In his song cycle \\u201cI Will Learn to Love a Person,\\u201d Christopher Cerrone combines Minimalism and a casually profane confessional text by Tao Lin, initially suggesting a certain ironic detachment. But then Lindsay Kesselman\\u2019s anguish wells forth, spilling over the song\\u2019s brim. As in much of Cerrone\\u2019s best work, this unraveling is too exposed to be blas\\u00e9, and turns the piece into a genuine weeper, worthy of early opera. SETH COLTER WALLS\", \"At first glance, this album of four-hand piano pieces might seem like a middlebrow lark coming from two pianists capable of \\u2014 and known for \\u2014 much more difficulty and depth. But it\\u2019s one of the year\\u2019s most disarmingly lovely recordings, elevating amateur-level scores like Debussy\\u2019s Petite Suite with unwavering sensitivity and grace. JOSHUA BARONE\", \"For over a decade, you had to trust the people who said that Phelim McDermott\\u2019s production of \\u201cSatyagraha\\u201d was one of the best things at the Metropolitan Opera this century. Now we have proof in this, the first complete recording of the work \\u2014 captured in 2011 and finally released \\u2014 whose ending exemplifies Philip Glass\\u2019s operatic writing at its finest: mysterious, meditative, endless beauty. JOSHUA BARONE\", \"This ambitious suite from the saxophonist and composer Charlotte Greve contains guitar parts that might appeal to fans of jazz musician Nels Cline. And its choral writing should excite devotees of Roomful of Teeth. Yet it\\u2019s the effortless feel of Greve\\u2019s fusion that feels most notable \\u2014 and capable of creating new audiences of its own. SETH COLTER WALLS\", \"Time seems to stand still when Bellezza \\u2014 Beauty \\u2014 cleanses herself of \\u201cfaithless yearning\\u201d and \\u201cvain passion\\u201d as she peers toward God at the conclusion of Handel\\u2019s \\u201cIl Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno.\\u201d It\\u2019s a moment that Sabine Devieilhe sings with apt simplicity, as the lutenist Thomas Dunford, the violinist Sophie Gent and the conductor Rapha\\u00ebl Pichon cast a spell around her, as if to lift her heavenward. DAVID ALLEN\", \"At the dawn of the 17th century, the composer Sigismondo d\\u2019India was a master of intimate chamber madrigals of luminous clarity, unexpected harmonies and startling evocations of emotional extremity. In \\u201cIo viddi in terra angelici costumi,\\u201d a setting of Petrarch, both the piece and the soprano Julie Roset\\u2019s performance on a new d\\u2019India compilation reach hypnotic heights. ZACHARY WOOLFE\", \"Star pianists have long championed the piano solos of Nikolai Kapustin, a jazz-inspired Russian maverick. But we haven\\u2019t had many recordings of his concertos for the instrument. Frank Dupree offered redress this year, with a fizzy, addictive performance of the Fourth. The performance was a reminder of the productive (if underexplored) sway American jazz has had over global classical culture. SETH COLTER WALLS\", \"Archival releases have proceeded unabated this year, as record companies continue to mine their catalogs in the name of more or less worthy causes. Jeanne Demessieux is certainly the former, an organist of staggering ability whose reputation unfairly dimmed after her untimely death in 1968. This Liszt, from 1952, is ample proof of her talents, a ferocious assault on a work of frightening difficulty, yielding intensely musical results. DAVID ALLEN\", \"In recent years the charismatic, smoky-voiced Jonas Kaufmann has been in demand as a heldentenor in roles now including Wagner\\u2019s Tristan. But on this marvelous album, with the fine pianist Helmut Deutsch, devoted to Liszt\\u2019s imaginative (and still-neglected) songs, Kaufmann is often in his more tender, intimate mode, as in his alluring performance of \\u201cDer K\\u00f6nig von Thule.\\u201d ANTHONY TOMMASINI\", \"On this fascinating album, the pianist Leif Ove Andsnes presents works that Mozart wrote during the artistically transformative year of 1785, including three piano concertos, a piano quartet and other scores. This spirited and crisp yet elegant account of the finale from the Concerto No. 22 may be my favorite track. ANTHONY TOMMASINI\", \"When the pandemic made in-person performances impossible, the superb violinist Jennifer Koh began an inspiring project to commission short solos, which she premiered online from her Manhattan apartment. \\u201cAlone Together\\u201d offers the results: 39 strikingly diverse pieces, among them Ang\\u00e9lica Negr\\u00f3n\\u2019s playful, inventive \\u201cCooper and Emma.\\u201d ANTHONY TOMMASINI\", \"In Salieri\\u2019s opera \\u201cArmida,\\u201d given a taut, elegant recording this year, the two lovers \\u2014 Armida, a sorceress of Damascus, and the enraptured Christian crusader Rinaldo \\u2014 are both sopranos, which lends a \\u201cRosenkavalier\\u201d feel to their early idyll. This duet shows both their passion and their mutual suspicion as their spell begins to break. ZACHARY WOOLFE\", \"Aside from writing chamber and orchestral music, David Sanford also runs a big band. That group\\u2019s latest release reveals some of Sanford\\u2019s current enthusiasms. On this track, a strangled-gasp sound reminiscent of Helmut Lachenmann\\u2019s music provides some initial kindling. Later, the bonfire climax is indebted to the experimentalism of Miles Davis circa \\u201cAgharta.\\u201d SETH COLTER WALLS\", \"From 2013 to 2019, the Resonant Bodies Festival explored experimental vocal music at the start of each New York fall season. The use of electronics \\u2014 as canvas for, and distortion of, the voices \\u2014 was widespread. Texts were far rarer than squawks, moans, clicks and wails. The prevailing style was agile expressionism, as in this 2017 piece by Kamala Sankaram, a highlight of a memorable compendium of festival highlights. ZACHARY WOOLFE\", \"If there is a finer match of musician and composer than Christian Gerhaher and Robert Schumann, I would be surprised. The 11-disc box from which this track comes fulfills Gerhaher\\u2019s mission to record the complete songs of his idol, and it ends with this \\u201cRequiem,\\u201d a song \\u201cso full of feeling, a coming-together of spirituality and sensuality,\\u201d as the baritone has put it. It is the perfect demonstration of Gerhaher\\u2019s surpassing art. DAVID ALLEN\", \"The latest essential release from the formidable pianist Igor Levit is a three-disc album pairing commanding accounts of Shostakovich\\u2019s 24 Preludes and Fugues with the Scottish composer Ronald Stevenson\\u2019s daunting, fantastical \\u201cPassacaglia on DSCH,\\u201d a 90-minute suite paying homage to Shostakovich. Listen to Levit\\u2019s probing performance of this fugue, and you will want to hear them all. ANTHONY TOMMASINI\", \"This radio-ready opener to Gabriella Smith and Gabriel Cabezas\\u2019s album \\u201cLost Coast\\u201d is difficult to categorize. Art song, political anthem, pop \\u2014 all or none of the above? Regardless, it\\u2019s a work of affecting counterpoint: the rage that accumulates in the layered sounds of Cabezas\\u2019s extended cello technique against the resignation of Smith\\u2019s elegiac vocals. JOSHUA BARONE\", \"Tyshawn Sorey has long worked with a stretched-out scale of time that can invite comparisons with Morton Feldman. But here, across 53 minutes of material \\u2014 patiently arranged for subgroups within the chamber ensemble Alarm Will Sound \\u2014 the wide variation of instrumental colors and harmonic material serves as a clear encomium to another composer: George Lewis, a mentor of Sorey\\u2019s who is also still in rude creative health. SETH COLTER WALLS\", \"Listening to Anna Thorvaldsdottir\\u2019s music, I often feel like I\\u2019m hearing the earth through a stethoscope. But her debut string quartet more resembles dispatches emerging from the white noise of another world. It\\u2019s a masterly entrance to the genre, and a deceptively vast soundscape conjured with just four acoustic instruments. JOSHUA BARONE\"]","href_hash":"cd28aad25d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cd28aad25d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}},
