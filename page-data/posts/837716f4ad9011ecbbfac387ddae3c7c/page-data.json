Both men talked of Moana Pasifika's existence as a 'journey', and while the 45-test All Black Mauger should be mindful of echoing the infamous words of his former coach John Mitchell, it's unlikely he thought they'd be at this destination quite so soon.\", \"It was a tad ironic that the win came at the Warriors' home ground, because at the same time that team was recording their first win of the season too. However, their 16-14 result against the hapless, hopeless and winless Wests Tigers is unlikely to be celebrated the way Moana Pasifika's maiden win was.\", \"The simple fact as to why, is that for long periods the game was unwatchable, with both sides giving ample evidence as to why their rivalry this year may well decide the NRL wooden spoon.\", \"The game was so bad the Warriors' social media described it as a 'tough night at the office', a phrase usually reserved for when you lose.\", \"Still, it's good news after a week in which Euan Aitken asked for an early release in his contract, citing a desire to stay based in Australia next season - an odd motivation for a guy who signed with a team literally called the New Zealand Warriors. Hopefully he reads the terms of employment a bit better next time, but it's another case of an NRL contract being about as legally valid as a roll of toilet paper.\", \"There is an interesting development in the Warriors' draw though and it's not who they're playing against, but rather when.\", \"Having long had the Sunday afternoon time slot locked in as the home for the majority of their games, the Warriors are starting this year with five straight Friday and Saturday evening games. That puts them in direct competition with Super Rugby, so it is clear that NRL very much foretold the blood in the water over the 15-a-side code's troubles getting Super Rugby Pacific up and running.\", \"It would be very interesting to see what the viewing figures are from Sky over the clash, because if this objectively bad Warriors team are winning it, that should be sending alarm bells ringing at NZ Rugby.\"]","href_hash":"837716f4ad9011ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"837716f4ad9011ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
