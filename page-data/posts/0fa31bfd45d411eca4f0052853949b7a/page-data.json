The Journal on Oct. 8 first reported that Gruden, who is white, had used racist tropes to denigrate DeMaurice Smith, who is Black and is the executive director of the N.F.L. Players Association.\", \"When Gruden remained as coach after the Journal report, the league, according to the suit, \\u201cratcheted up the pressure\\u201d by hinting that additional documents would be made public if the Raiders did not fire Gruden. The suit accuses the N.F.L. of then leaking more messages to The Times, which published its report on Oct. 11. Gruden resigned within hours.\", \"Jordan Cohen, a spokesman for The Times, said, \\u201cAs a matter of policy, The Times does not discuss its sourcing.\\u201d The Journal declined to comment.\", \"The emails were discovered by the league during an investigation into workplace misconduct accusations against the Washington Football Team, which didn\\u2019t directly involve Gruden. The emails had been exchanged with the former Washington team president Bruce Allen, among others, during Gruden\\u2019s stretch as an ESPN commentator, and before he became the Raiders\\u2019 coach in 2018. In them, he regularly disparaged people across the N.F.L., including Goodell.\", \"Raiders owner Mark Davis told reporters on Oct. 27, when the league\\u2019s owners met in New York, that team officials had learned about the emails only when The Journal contacted them. The league then sent a batch of emails to the Raiders. Davis said that he wondered why the league, which had the emails for months, did not share them sooner.\", \"Those emails represented a fraction of roughly 650,000 messages reviewed by the N.F.L., which determined that the workplace environment in Washington was \\u201chighly unprofessional\\u201d and perpetuated bullying and intimidation. Washington was fined $10 million, but the league released only a short summary of the investigation \\u2014 not a full accounting.\", \"\\u201cThere is no explanation or justification for why Gruden\\u2019s emails were the only ones made public out of the 650,000 emails collected in the N.F.L.\\u2019s investigation of the Washington Football Team or for why the emails were held for months before being released in the middle of the Raiders\\u2019 season,\\u201d Adam Hosmer-Henner, one of Gruden\\u2019s lawyers, said in a statement.\", \"Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the league, called the allegations \\u201centirely meritless.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe N.F.L. will vigorously defend against these claims,\\u201d McCarthy said in an email to The Times.\", \"In the aftermath of Gruden\\u2019s resignation, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers \\u2014 whom he coached to the franchise\\u2019s first Super Bowl title, in the 2002 season \\u2014 removed his name from their Ring of Honor at Raymond James Stadium. Gruden had insulted a member of the Glazer family, which owns the team, in a 2015 message. Gruden also lost his endorsement deal with the footwear and apparel company Skechers and was taken out of the Madden NFL 22 video game.\", \"He also may have damaged his relationship with one of his former players on the Raiders, Carl Nassib, who in June became the first active N.F.L. player to publicly say that he is gay. Gruden used a derogatory term in writing that Goodell had pressured the Rams to draft Michael Sam, a gay player selected in 2014. Nassib requested a personal day and did not join the Raiders at practice when the team gathered for the first time after Gruden left.\", \"Gruden apologized in a statement the night he resigned, saying that he \\u201cnever meant to hurt anyone.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"0fa31bfd45d411eca4f0052853949b7a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0fa31bfd45d411eca4f0052853949b7a"}},
