\"Gravitational waves were first discovered in 2015, with the Nobel Prize-winning\\u00a0detection of two merging black holes by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO).\", \"Since then, astronomers have detected\\u00a0gravitational waves created by the collision of \\u00a0two neutron stars\\u00a0\\u2013\\u00a0the dense remnants of massive stars that died \\u2013\\u00a0producing\\u00a0a fireball known as a kilonova.\", \"They've also detected waves created by\\u00a0black holes swallowing a\\u00a0 neutron star.\", \"The addition of 35\\u00a0new confirmed observations of these tiny ripples in the fabric of space time, published today on ArXiv,\\u00a0takes the tally of detections to 90.\", \"\\\"Our first observing run [in 2015] went for four months and we got three events [including the initial detection,\\\" said astrophysicist Susan Scott of the Australian National University and a member of the international Advanced\\u00a0LIGO team.\", \"\\\"This run is only one month longer and we've got 35.\\\"\", \"The gravitational waves were detected between November 2019 and March 2020 after the Advanced LIGO and Virgo observatories had been upgraded.\", \"Professor Scott said the new detections were very exciting.\", \"\\\"Information from the black hole\\u00a0masses and spins \\u2026\\u00a0give us a lot of information about how the structure of the universe formed.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">A bag of black holes and neutron stars</div>\", \"Like the initial detections, 32 of the new gravitational waves were created in the moments leading up to the collision of two black holes.\", \"One of these collisions, known as\\u00a0GW200220_061928, was created by a\\u00a0massive pair of black holes orbiting each other, with a combined mass 145 times heavier than the Sun.\", \"While not the largest merger seen to date, this merger created another black hole in a range only recently discovered, Professor Scott said.\", \"Another two detections involved the gobbling up of a neutron star by a black hole.\", \"The final one, dubbed\\u00a0GW200210_092254,\\u00a0created between an object that is 24 times the mass of our Sun and a lighter object that is 2.83 solar masses, is a bit \\\"ambiguous\\\", Professor Scott said.\", \"It\\u00a0could be created by two black holes, or a black hole and a neutron star.\", \"\\\"Our theories to get one that big [2.83 solar masses] are not thick on the ground.\", \"\\\"My own personal feeling is it's probably a black hole\\u00a0which has been formed in an earlier life by two neutron stars smashing together,\\\" Professor Scott said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What's next for gravitational wave discoveries?</div>\", \"<img

LIGO detectors in the US (pictured) and the Advanced LIGO detector in Italy.(LIGO/Caltech)</div>\", \"Each time the Advanced\\u00a0LIGO and Virgo detectors are\\u00a0upgraded, they can see further out into the universe and capture more events.\", \"The\\u00a0next observing run will start in August 2022.\", \"\\\"We are expecting to get a lot of gravitational wave events in that observing run and hopefully some new things too,\\\" Professor Scott said.\", \"The team is now on the\\u00a0hunt for gravitational waves created by supernova explosions.\", \"\\\"In the past they've been too weak for us to detect them, but we are getting into that realm where that should be possible,\\\" she said.\", \"Another big one the team would like to spot is gravitational waves created by a single\\u00a0misshapen neutron star.\", \"\\\"Neutron stars are the mystery objects of the universe,\\\" Professor Scott said.\", \"\\\"They\\u00a0are the densest type of matter in the universe and we can't study that kind of matter in laboratories on Earth because the conditions are just too extreme.\\\"\", \"According to Einstein's theory of relativity, a single\\u00a0object needs to be asymmetric to create gravitational waves.\", \"\\\"So if a neutron star was a bit more like an AFL football, it should produce gravitational waves,\\\" she said.\"]","href_hash":"256adc76406711ec9e61a965f55170f5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"256adc76406711ec9e61a965f55170f5"}},
