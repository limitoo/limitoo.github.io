Obviously, those last couple [of games] were disappointing, no-one hurts more around losses like that than the team and management.\", \"\\\"I know there's a lot of frustration in other parts about those performances, but it's always been the case with players and coaches - they hurt more than anyone else.\", \"\\\"That's why the resolve is so hard here to improve, take the [lessons] from the review - which we're actively engaging in at the moment - and then move decisively to provide whatever we need to, in terms of Ian having everything at his disposal to go into next year and create opportunities to have great performances.\\\"\", \"One resource available to Foster from 2022 onwards will be the assistance of newly appointed selector Joe Schmidt.\", \"Although his job title might not infer it, Schmidt, 56, is a world-class coach in his own right, guiding Ireland to the top of World Rugby rankings and twice defeating the All Blacks - a feat never previously achieved by the nation.\", \"On paper, Schmidt will only assist in All Blacks selection, but the reality of having one of rugby's best coaches in Foster's camp isn't lost on Robinson, who hints that more change could be on the way, as NZR reviews the past 12 months.\", \"\\\"Certainly, Joe Schmidt's appointment is obviously in keeping with that,\\\" he adds.\\\"We've stayed in touch with Joe for some time.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We believe he's a wonderful addition to the group. He's excited by it now, and I know Ian and the team will be excited to have him on board.\", \"\\\"That's the first step, and we just have to work through the remainder of the review to see what other things we can learn from and respond to.\\\"\", \"Tune in to Newshub at 6pm for Mark Robinson's interview with rugby reporter Ollie Ritchie\"]","href_hash":"7d0ecd325e5211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7d0ecd325e5211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
