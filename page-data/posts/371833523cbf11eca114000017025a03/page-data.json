Governors across the nation have advocated for the program's extension until COVID-19 cases drop.\", \"\\\"One non-working week is not enough to break the chain of infection,\\\" Tomsk Governor Sergei Zhvachkin said.\", \"Some other restrictions continue to remain in place across the country. Older adults are ordered to stay at home and 30 percent of any business's staff has to work from home. Public venues such as theaters and museums are closed to those who have not been fully vaccinated, have already recovered from COVID-19, or are able to present a negative test.\", \"Less than 35 percent of Russia's population, which consists of nearly 146 million people, are fully vaccinated from COVID-19.
