Dinner tonight might be pasta and cannellini beans with a sauce of beurre blanc (above), a recipe that Tejal Rao learned from the British cookbook author Jack Monroe. I like it because it\\u2019s easy and luxurious and comes together fast. And it\\u2019ll leave me time to prepare the marinade for these awesome pork gyros for tomorrow or the next day, with oven-baked French fries on the side, and ketchup spiked with hot sauce and yogurt run through with lemon juice and garlic.\", \"It\\u2019s the season of the make-ahead, after all: brandied dried fruit for cakes and braises alike; dirty chai earthquake cookies to take into the still-quiet office, to share with those who made the trek; a black cake to feed with rum until the end of the month.\", \"But I\\u2019ll make more than food for the future this week. I want to give this chocolate cake with peppermint frosting a try as well. A version might end up on the Christmas table, to follow the ham. (Here, by the way, is a hilariously specific collection of recipes we have: Breads for Ham.) I\\u2019d like to make linguine with lemon sauce one night soon. And Maangchi\\u2019s recipe for cheese buldak as well.\", \"I could go for some pasta puttanesca. I\\u2019d love to tuck into a platter of veal Pojarski. Roasted squash salad would be a lovely dinner, too, out of the fertile mind of Ned Baldwin, the chef and owner of Houseman in New York. And how about a grain frittata with chile lime and fresh herbs? Or gochugaru salmon with crispy rice? That, too!\", \"Click your way over to New York Times Cooking to see what else you find. Thousands and thousands of recipes await.
