He typically takes the remainder of the season off after each Winter Games.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve decided this will be my last Olympics,\\u201d White told reporters at a news conference in Beijing. \\u201cI\\u2019ve given it my all. There have been some ups and downs on the way to get here. And with that I feel I\\u2019ve got stronger and better.\\u201d\", \"White, the world\\u2019s most famous snowboarder, first competed in the Olympics in Turin, Italy, in 2006. Nicknamed the Flying Tomato for his long red hair, he won that competition, then repeated the feat at the 2010 Vancouver Games.\", \"The victories turned White into a sports icon and a household name. He finished fourth at the 2014 Sochi Games, then won a dramatic third gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, using his third and final run to soar to victory.\", \"After flirting with the idea of competing in skateboarding at the Tokyo Summer Olympics \\u2014 White is an accomplished skateboarder, but was unlikely to qualify \\u2014 it was uncertain if he would compete in Beijing.\", \"But he decided to try to qualify for one of the four positions on the U.S. halfpipe team, and used a podium finish in Switzerland last month to snare a spot. He said then that Beijing would be his final ride at the Olympics. Now it appears that it may be his final ride through the halfpipe in any meaningful contest.\", \"For the first time, however, White is not favored to win Olympic gold. Japan\\u2019s Ayumu Hirano, twice a silver medalist, is the leading contender, and several of his Japanese teammates expect to reach the podium, too.\", \"White appears to be enjoying his first-ever role as an underdog.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m just so excited about everything,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOpening ceremony was incredible.
