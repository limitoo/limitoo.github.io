The latest Gunther has his own private jet, frequently flying to destinations like Milan and the Bahamas.\", \"Gunther's team always makes sure the dog has everything he needs, whether that be a tennis ball or the finest meat and caviar.\", \"Handlers for Gunther's grandfather, Gunther IV, purchased the 1.2-acre Tuscan-style villa from pop star Madonna for $7.5 million. A gilded portrait of Gunther IV hangs over the living room fireplace.\", \"Real estate agent Ruthie Assouline told the AP that while she has dealt with many multimillion-dollar listings, one owned by a German shepherd is a first.\", \"\\\"He lives in Madonna's former master bedroom,\\\" Assouline said. \\\"He literally sleeps overlooking the most magnificent view in an Italian custom bed in the former bedroom of the greatest pop star in the world.\\\"\", \"The AP reported that a board oversees the dog's trust and chooses what to do with the money.
