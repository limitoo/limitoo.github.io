The warrant comes as local officials continue their investigation into the fatal shooting on the \\\"Rust\\\" film set on October 21.\", \"Authorities believe Baldwin used his phone to discuss the \\\"Rust\\\" production in the months prior to the shooting and want to search it \\\"for any evidence relating to the death investigation of Halyna Hutchins,\\\" the search warrant said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Affiant believes gathering information prior to the film start date of Rust is essential for a full investigation,\\\" the warrant request read.\", \"According to the warrant, authorities also searched Hutchins' phone and found conversations about the film's production dating back to July 2021. They also found photos of receipts from businesses in the Santa Fe area \\u2014 near the film's set \\u2014 from September.\", \"Authorities will download nearly all of the data on his phone, including photos, text messages, social network private messages, contacts, recent call history, GPS data and other files.\", \"However, the warrant clearly states that any information that is obtained by authorities and deemed irrelevant to the investigation will be \\\"sealed and later destroyed as soon as feasible.\\\"\", \"No one has been charged in the shooting that killed\\u00a0Hutchins, the film's cinematographer, and injured director\\u00a0Joel Souza.\", \"Earlier this month in his first interview since the incident, Baldwin said\\u00a0that although the incident remains under investigation, it is \\\"overwhelmingly likely that it was an accident\\\" and that he will not be charged.\", \"In the wake of the shooting, crew members have alleged that producers skimped on\\u00a0safety procedures\\u00a0to save money, and two have\\u00a0filed\\u00a0civil lawsuits. Baldwin said in last month's interview he was not aware of any complaints regarding safety on set.\", \"Baldwin said both armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and first assistant director David Halls \\u2014 two people who he said he trusted to do the job \\u2014 had handled the guns, although Gutierrez-Reed was in charge of them most of the time. Baldwin maintained that it was not his responsibility to ensure that the guns were safe.\", \"\\\"In terms of the handling of the gun, that day I did exactly what I've done every day on that movie,\\\" Baldwin said. \\\"The actor's responsibility is to do what the prop armorer tells them to do.\\\"\", \"\\\"Someone is responsible for what happened and I can't say who that is, but I know it's not me,\\\" he said.\", \"Sophie Reardon is a News Editor at CBS News.
