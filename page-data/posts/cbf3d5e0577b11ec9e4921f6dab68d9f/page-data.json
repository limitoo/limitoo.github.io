But the Met moved uncharacteristically quickly to follow \\u201cFire\\u201d by bringing \\u201cChampion\\u201d to its stage in April 2023; Peter Gelb, the company\\u2019s general manager, said that the production was coming together \\u201con the turn of a dime.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cPart of the Met\\u2019s future sustainability is predicated on our ability to make changes,\\u201d he added. \\u201cWe want opera to be present in the world in which we live.\\u201d\", \"Blanchard welcomed the news, encouraged by his experience of bringing \\u201cFire\\u201d to the Met stage. \\u201cGoing through the process with that level of talent \\u2014 it\\u2019s a serious drug, dude,\\u201d he said in an interview. \\u201cTo experience that one time only makes you want to experience it again.\\u201d\", \"A so-called opera in jazz, \\u201cChampion\\u201d premiered in 2013 at Opera Theater of St. Louis, in a production by James Robinson that will travel to New York. (That company also premiered \\u201cFire\\u201d in 2019, and Robinson later co-directed it with Camille A. Brown at the Met.) It is based on the life of the closeted gay boxer Emile Griffith, who was taunted with homophobic slurs by his opponent Benny Paret before a 1962 title match that led to Paret\\u2019s death. \\u201cI killed a man and the world forgives me,\\u201d goes a line in Michael Cristofer\\u2019s libretto. \\u201cI love a man and the world wants to kill me.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cEmile Griffith never wanted to be a world champion fighter,\\u201d Cristofer, a Tony Award-winning playwright, said in a statement. \\u201cHe wanted to play baseball. He wanted to make hats. And most of all, he wanted to sing. Bringing his story of forgiveness and redemption to the Met, to have it sung from this great stage, would have made him very, very happy.\\u201d\", \"The work depicts Griffith at different stages of his life. At the Met, his younger self will be sung by Ryan Speedo Green, a standout in \\u201cFire\\u201d and other productions this fall; while Eric Owens will portray him as an older man. Yannick N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin, the Met\\u2019s music director who also led \\u201cFire,\\u201d will conduct.\", \"\\u201cFire\\u201d was by many measures a triumph for the Met. It was warmly received by critics and sold out its final four performances. Blanchard has already been asked to write a new opera for the company, but in the meantime, Gelb said, the fast-tracked production of \\u201cChampion\\u201d was conceived in \\u201cthe afterglow of the success of \\u2018Fire.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Between the St. Louis and New York runs, Blanchard revised \\u201cFire\\u201d and continued to tweak it during rehearsals as he learned the idiosyncrasies of the enormous Met auditorium\\u2019s sound. He plans to do the same for \\u201cChampion,\\u201d which was his first opera \\u2014 \\u201ca lot of shooting in the dark,\\u201d he said, adding that he has learned much more about writing for voice since then and wants revisit the score with a post-\\u201cFire\\u201d mind. Cristofer\\u2019s libretto and Robinson\\u2019s productions will also undergo changes.\", \"\\u201cThe story itself has more drama than \\u2018Fire,\\u2019\\u201d Blanchard said. \\u201cI anticipate it to be a very dramatic production, but we want to cut some scenes down, and I want to go in and look for where I can add chorus.\\u201d\", \"Blanchard is particularly looking forward to being reunited with N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin. \\u201cMan, he gets it,\\u201d he said of the conductor. \\u201cHe\\u2019s smart, and he\\u2019s passionate about it.\\u201d\", \"With \\u201cChampion\\u201d and \\u201cFire,\\u201d the Met is set to present company premieres of operas by Black composers in three consecutive seasons. (Anthony Davis\\u2019s 1986 \\u201cX: The Life and Times of Malcolm X,\\u201d is planned for fall 2023.) Asked what that presaged for the coming years, Gelb said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s the way of the future.\\u201d\", \"Blanchard said that this streak, after nearly 140 years of neglecting Black composers, was \\u201ca major shift.\\u201d But, he added, \\u201cit\\u2019s not just about African Americans.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s people from all walks of life,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe have to see how all that plays out, but I don\\u2019t want to be a token. I wanted \\u2018Fire\\u2019 to be the production that opened up the doors for everybody. And the talent is out there.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"cbf3d5e0577b11ec9e4921f6dab68d9f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cbf3d5e0577b11ec9e4921f6dab68d9f"}},
