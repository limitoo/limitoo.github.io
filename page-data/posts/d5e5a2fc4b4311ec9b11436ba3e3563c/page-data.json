The Roys run a right-wing media empire, so they spend a lot of time around politicians; and the family members themselves, at least on a performative level, have fiercely held ideals. (Or fluidly held in the case of Kendall and Shiv, who have lately sort of switched sides.) Rarely has this series engaged in as much sustained commentary on the sorry state of modern politics as occurs in this week\\u2019s episode.\", \"The title, \\u201cWhat It Takes,\\u201d is likely a reference to Richard Ben-Cramer\\u2019s nonfiction account of the 1988 U.S. presidential race, in which he examined in-depth the biographies and the campaigns of two Republicans and four Democrats, considering what drove these men to run. The book explores the gulf that often opens up between the candidates\\u2019 impressive credentials and how they sell themselves to voters and the media.\", \"In the \\u201cSuccession\\u201d version, the guys vying for the Republican nomination at a Virginia gathering of conservative thought leaders aren\\u2019t exactly the best and the brightest. Up for consideration at an emergency meeting of the Future Freedom Summit are: Vice President Dave Boyer (Reed Birney), the \\u201csteady old plow-horse,\\u201d who\\u2019s like a second-rate copy of his retiring boss; Rick Salgado (Yul Vazquez), a moderate Reaganite elitist trying to convince the base that he\\u2019s now a big tent, blue collar populist; and Jeryd Mencken (Justin Kirk), a slick-talking nativist who says of a diversifying America that he supports integrating \\u201cnew elements\\u201d but, \\u201cC\\u2019mon man, slowly.\\u201d\", \"Bringing up the rear is Connor Roy, about whom his own brother Roman says: \\u201cSure, I dunno, yeah. Wait, but like, really?\\u201d\", \"This meet-up in Virginia has been called \\u201cthe ATN primary,\\u201d hastily arranged after the cable news network tossed out the Raisin. Next on the ATN agenda: telling their largely Republican viewers which puppet they should be devoted to now. (Cue Greg: \\u201cBut is that, like, constitutional?\\u201d)\", \"Logan shrugs off the hype and drama, saying, \\u201cI need to keep my spoon in the soup.\\u201d But he clearly has more on his mind than just deciding, as an ordinary American citizen, who would make a great president. He wants someone who will throw some administrative roadblocks in front of the tech companies who are stealing ATN\\u2019s audience. More important, he wants someone who\\u2019ll squelch the Justice Department\\u2019s investigation into Brightstar.\", \"So the Roys gather in their suite, debating their options and seeing which candidate will be the most pliable. Maybe it\\u2019s Boyer, who hustles when Logan calls him up and asks him \\u2014 not entirely jokingly \\u2014 to \\u201crun me over a Coke\\u201d and also to \\u201cfire the deputy attorney general.\\u201d Maybe it\\u2019s Salgado, who can go deep into the weeds on policy. Maybe it\\u2019s the up-and-coming firebrand Mencken, who calls ATN \\u201cdead\\u201d and compares it to an afternoon pudding cup in a nursing home. Or maybe it\\u2019s Connor, who \\u2026 OK, who are we kidding? It\\u2019s not Connor. (Although Greg does politely say, \\u201cI think I could see myself spoiling my ballot in his favor.\\u201d)\", \"Logan will make the final call, as Roman (a Mencken man) and Shiv (a Salgado supporter) play the devil and angel on his shoulder, whispering suggestions. Connor is in the room, unwaveringly backing himself. And Tom and Greg are there ostensibly as \\u201cfamily,\\u201d though both know that no one will pay attention to what a couple of potential jailbirds say. (Greg stays mostly quiet, \\u201cminimizing the Greg window.\\u201d But he does stick around because while he\\u2019s a registered voter, \\u201cI just feel like you maybe get a bigger vote in here.\\u201d)\", \"Tom and Greg \\u2014 especially Tom \\u2014 are responsible for some much-needed comic relief in what is otherwise a fairly dark and occasionally disturbing episode. Tom at first default to poking fun at Greg, saying the young man will like this summit because, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a nice safe space where you don\\u2019t have to pretend to like \\u2018Hamilton.\\u2019\\u201d But the truth is that Tom genuinely appreciates being able to talk with someone who understands his prison anxieties \\u2014 unlike Shiv, who is sick of hearing him obsess about it.\", \"Tom and Greg grab a meal at a local diner because Tom has been trying to get used to the bland, starchy food he has been told he will be served behind bars. Greg spills his fears that, \\u201cBecause of my physical length, I could be a target for all kinds of misadventure.\\u201d He also mentions the rumor he has heard that sometimes prisoners humiliate their cellmates by using their pillowcases as toilet paper. (\\u201cI know,\\u201d Tom interjects. \\u201cI\\u2019ve read the prison blogs.\\u201d)\", \"Later, Tom returns to what appears to be the same diner with Kendall, who has stealthily rolled into Virginia in hopes of sowing dissension in the Roy ranks. Kendall thinks he can flip Tom, who is in dire need of an ally. He warns his brother-in-law that while Logan may seem all-powerful and that Shiv may seem loyal, Tom can\\u2019t really count on either of them to save him from incarceration. Tom appears too resigned to his fate to fight. (\\u201cI have of late decided not to tarry too much with hope.\\u201d) But he does listen to Kendall \\u2026 and maybe he actually hears him.\", \"What Tom doesn\\u2019t know, though, is that Kendall right now is flailing. He bombed at the shareholders\\u2019 meeting. He is not welcome at the Future Freedom Summit, given that he accuses the attendees of \\u201cburning books and measuring skulls down in Nuremberg, Virginia.\\u201d And he has just fired Lisa Arthur, \\u201cthe best lawyer in town\\u201d (a designation he puts in quotation marks himself), because she seems more interested in cooperating with the feds than with aggressively countering Waystar. \\u201cTurns out she\\u2019s a toxic person,\\u201d he says to his assistants in explaining his decision to cut Lisa loose.\", \"Kendall had hoped to be the kingmaker whom future presidential candidates would have to court. Instead, it\\u2019s Roman who gets to corner Mencken in the bathroom of the Roys\\u2019 suite, in an absolutely riveting and more than a little terrifying scene. In a few intense minutes, Roman takes the measure of this man, to see just how committed he is to the whole neo-fascist agenda. Is he really willing to borrow ideas from Franco or Travis Bickle or \\u201ca very naughty boy named H?\\u201d\", \"Roman would like Mencken to be just obnoxious enough to fire up the base, but with a little bit of a wink so as not to scare off the center. His ideal is \\u201cDeep State Conspiracy Hour\\u201d but, \\u201cy\\u2019know, funny.\\u201d He also reminds Mencken that while ATN may seem like yesterdays news, they did just topple a President \\u2014 and then immediately rattled the Justice Department with a rumor that the deputy A.G. is pursuing a personal grudge.\", \"Shiv is appalled that Roman and Logan would even consider Mencken, especially when Salgado is more palatable and less potentially dangerous to the whole American experiment. Roman of course belittles her choice. (\\u201cI think you\\u2019re so brave for picking the brown man.\\u201d) And when she tells her dad that Mencken is widely hated and begs him to \\u201clook at the climate,\\u201d Logan wryly replies: \\u201cThe climate said I should step aside. I guess I\\u2019m a climate denier.\\u201d\", \"The episode ends with an echo of the \\u201cSuccession\\u201d opening credits as the Roys gather for a group photo with their new Chosen One. Shiv tries to refuse, but Logan presses her until she relents and says, \\u201cI\\u2019ll be in the photo but not right next to him.\\u201d He sighs, \\u201cYou win, Pinky.\\u201d But this is not even remotely true. Not wanting to be exiled like Kendall, Shiv has edged closer toward supporting a political philosophy she genuinely thinks is dangerous.\", \"What it takes, indeed.\"]","href_hash":"d5e5a2fc4b4311ec9b11436ba3e3563c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d5e5a2fc4b4311ec9b11436ba3e3563c"}},
