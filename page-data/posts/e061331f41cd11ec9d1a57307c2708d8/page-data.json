It's quite a lengthy process to restart an airline.\\\"\", \"Each day counted, he said.\", \"\\\"Ideally we would like to know even right now what's happening, but you know, we appreciate that sometimes these decisions come a bit later on in the piece, so we just have to have to adjust accordingly, but absolutely each day counts ... but we've got ourselves reasonably juiced up for a pretty decent amount of flying through December, January, February.\\\"\", \"The airline could put more flights on if needed.\", \"\\\"As soon as we can get some information we will move accordingly.\\\"\", \"There were some \\\"fantastic\\\" prices on flights available, he said.\", \"\\\"You know some of these these flights one way $49, $59 and and that's reflective of the fact that we've put on quite a bit of capacity and and a lot of people are still holding back to see what's going to happen and no doubt if we do get a green light to go, then I think we'll see plenty of people taking up those offers.\\\"\", \"Covid-19 had taught the airline a lot about needing to be loyal to smaller regions, Foran said.\", \"\\\"We've reflected that in our thinking and in the more recent lockdown that we've experienced, putting on those flights from Kerikeri to Wellington were a really big deal.\\\"\", \"The airline was looking at potential flights direct from Tauranga or Nelson to other regions.\", \"The Auckland shut down had cost Air New Zealand between $25 million to $35m per month.\", \"\\\"It's a big issue for us and and really, when you think about it, Air New Zealand now for some time has really only been operating outside of Auckland and cargo flights and what are we now about 640 days into Covid? So we are really looking forward to getting back out, getting some flying in.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"e061331f41cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e061331f41cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
