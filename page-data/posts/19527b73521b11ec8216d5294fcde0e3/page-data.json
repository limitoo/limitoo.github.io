I was imagining that it was going to have something to do with setting Mozart\\u2019s \\u201cEine kleine Nachtmusik\\u201d to some kind of story. Little did I know that that evening was going to be, in a way, the beginning of the rest of my life.\", \"\\u201cA Little Night Music\\u201d turned out to be, of course, a musical by Stephen Sondheim, a musicalization of Ingmar Bergman\\u2019s \\u201cSmiles of a Summer Night.\\u201d Around the middle of the early number combining the songs \\u201cNow,\\u201d \\u201cSoon\\u201d and \\u201cLater,\\u201d I realized that I was hearing some of the most wonderful music of any kind I had ever heard. The harmonies were Ravelian, the lyrics were dense yet conversational and genuinely funny. \\u201cWhat in God\\u2019s name is this?!\\u201d I kept thinking.\", \"I walked out on air.\", \"I get obsessed with things. After that, I wanted to hear more music by Sondheim and started collecting the requisite cast albums. Devotees I knew kept raving in particular about \\u201cSweeney Todd,\\u201d and I will never forget the cloudy afternoon in the summer of 1985 when I stretched out on a sofa, listened to it from beginning to end and arose feeling almost reborn.\", \"Then I wanted to know what the roots of this man\\u2019s work were, what had inspired him. His \\u201cFollies\\u201d is a pastiche score in which many of the songs were intended to sound like ones by composers such as Cole Porter and Irving Berlin. This led me to want to know what their songs were like, and one thing led to another. I didn\\u2019t grow up caring about musicals in any real way \\u2014 I was steeped mainly in jazz and classical. But these cast recordings were a revelation to me. I had no idea what \\u201cMy Fair Lady\\u201d was or why anybody would care about something called \\u201cNo, No, Nanette.\\u201d I soon found out: In a few years I had amassed hundreds of recordings (mostly on cassettes!) and had become a fan of musical theater. I stayed that way.\", \"But always, and forever, Sondheim has been my favorite. His work centers the genre for me \\u2014 everything is either before or after him \\u2014 and is one of my favorite things on Earth. His passing last week threw me quite a bit: He had been talking about a new work coming, and there was a possibility that I would have the opportunity to interview him myself for an audiobook series.\", \"Alas, that won\\u2019t be in the cards. But Sondheim\\u2019s work has threaded throughout my life since that night in 1984: The second musical my older daughter saw was a production of \\u201cA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.\\u201d She and my younger daughter argue in the car over whether we\\u2019re going to listen to \\u201cFollies\\u201d or \\u201cCompany.\\u201d Way back, I (rather miscast) played the lead in a small production of \\u201cMerrily We Roll Along,\\u201d and I have played piano for productions of \\u201cFunny Thing\\u201d and \\u201cInto the Woods.\\u201d Somehow, Sondheim has never gone away for me.\", \"Part of the reason is that Sondheim\\u2019s characters are often saturnine types like me. In \\u201cSunday in the Park With George,\\u201d the painter George Seurat sings of the difficulty in deriving ultimate pleasure from creation, as his lover seeks his company. Any writer can relate: \\u201cLook, I made a hat,\\u201d he quietly declares, as if to say, \\u201cHere\\u2019s why I couldn\\u2019t be with you \\u2014 isn\\u2019t it worth it?\\u201d To me that might as well be, \\u201cLook, I wrote an essay.\\u201d\", \"In \\u201cFollies,\\u201d Ben in middle age rues the things in life he didn\\u2019t get to, and now knows he never will in \\u201cThe Road You Didn\\u2019t Take.\\u201d When I heard that song in my 20s, I just knew I was going to feel that way when I was Ben\\u2019s age and dreaded it. Now, here I am, musing on exactly that sort of thing as I consider that in four years, I\\u2019ll be 60. Then there\\u2019s the architect Addison Mizner (yes, Sondheim wrote a musical about him and his brother) coming to realize, as he gathers a mess of objets from parts hither and yon, that he has found his m\\u00e9tier at last. Only Sondheim, in \\u201cAddison\\u2019s Trip,\\u201d would write a song about a man finding what Aristotle called virtue.\", \"When I became a musicals addict in the \\u201980s, I noticed that there was a type of 50-something fan who had never taken to Sondheim\\u2019s music; they stopped roughly at \\u201cFiddler on the Roof,\\u201d \\u201cMame\\u201d and \\u201cPippin.\\u201d I always vowed I would not become like them and would always be as open to the new stuff as to the old. But in truth, while they couldn\\u2019t get to Sondheim, I\\u2019m not sure I have ever really gotten past him.\", \"I try my best, but I don\\u2019t listen to \\u201cHamilton\\u201d or \\u201cHadestown\\u201d as much as I listen to \\u201cFollies\\u201d and \\u201cSweeney Todd.\\u201d I\\u2019m beginning to accept that and to stop feeling guilty or incurious about it. There\\u2019s no place like home, and Sondheim\\u2019s work has been one of my home bases for most of my life. I don\\u2019t intend to die at all (that\\u2019s a whole different conversation), but if by chance I do, I hope I can do that interview with him at last.\"]","href_hash":"19527b73521b11ec8216d5294fcde0e3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"19527b73521b11ec8216d5294fcde0e3"}},
