Like DWAC, it's a SPAC or \\\"blank check company\\\" with no specific business intent other than to be used for mergers and asset acquisition. Orlando's position at the firm didn't suggest any direct connection to his work on Truth Social, although the Chinese government is notorious for its ideological oversight of companies, especially foreign-owned ones. Yunhong announced its intention to liquidate one month later.\", \"In a November 19 SEC filing, Orlando said Yunhong would \\\"dissolve and liquidate\\\" due to \\\"inability to consummate an initial business combination\\\" within the company's deadline. The firm would redeem all its outstanding shares at $10.31 per share, according to the notice. On Monday, Yunhong filed a Form 25 to delist from the securities exchange.\", \"Orlando is also CEO of Miami-based SPAC Benessere Capital Acquisition Corp.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947628/trumps-truth-social-moneyman-cuts-china-connections.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Left: Former President Donald Trump speaks during the rally in Phoenix, Arizona, on July 24, 2021.

The former president has been banned from social media giants Twitter and Facebook since his supporters stormed the Capitol in January.\", \"Also on Monday, DWAC revealed federal authorities were investigating the company and had asked for information pertaining to its merger as well as communications with TMTG prior to the deal.\", \"\\\"DWAC has received certain preliminary, fact-finding inquiries from regulatory authorities, with which it is cooperating,\\\" said a SEC filing. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is reviewing the merger, but the inquiry \\\"should not be construed\\\" as an indication that FINRA has found any violations, the filing noted.\", \"A second review\\u2014performed by the securities commission itself\\u2014\\\"does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone violated the law or that the SEC has a negative opinion of DWAC or any person, event, or security,\\\" it added.\"]","href_hash":"42e23d18583a11ecae1aa7c82e89adae"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"42e23d18583a11ecae1aa7c82e89adae"}},
