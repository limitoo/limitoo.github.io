Welch recused herself from investigating Meadows herself because he had contributed to her campaign and had appeared in advertisements on her behalf in 2014.\\u00a0\", \"The state attorney general's office referred the case to the State Bureau of Investigations, which confirmed its probe on Friday. This was first reported by WRAL.\", \"\\\"At the conclusion of the investigation, we'll review their findings,\\\" said Nazneen Ahmed, spokeswoman for the North Carolina attorney general.\\u00a0\", \"Meadows and his wife reportedly voted absentee in the 2020 election.

He has backed baseless claims that widespread voter fraud resulted in a \\\"stolen\\\" 2020 election. The House voted to hold Meadows in criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena to appear before the House elect committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\", \"Aaron Navarro is an associate producer for the political unit at CBS News, focusing on House and gubernatorial campaigns as well as the census and redistricting.\"]","href_hash":"8f8efae2a6d811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8f8efae2a6d811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
