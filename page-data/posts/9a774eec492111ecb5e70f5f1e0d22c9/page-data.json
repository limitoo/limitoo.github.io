The company\\u2019s orchestra and chorus were coming together for the first time with the cast of \\u201cEurydice\\u201d \\u2014 a recent adaptation of Sarah Ruhl\\u2019s wistful play, with music by Matthew Aucoin \\u2014 to run through the score in what\\u2019s known as a sitzprobe.\", \"Inside the vast and almost empty Met auditorium, Peter Gelb, the company\\u2019s general manager, typed on his laptop near the back of the theater. Ruhl was in the house; Mary Zimmerman, the director of the production, which opens on Tuesday, watched, too. Aucoin dashed around, listening for balances.\", \"At breaks, he rushed down the aisle to the pit to confer with the leader of any sitzprobe: the conductor. Here that was Yannick N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin, the Met\\u2019s music director, who offered the ensemble bits of counsel, sometimes asking for delicacy and transparency (\\u201cmore French in approach\\u201d), sometimes for lyricism (\\u201cviolas and cellos, you could sing a bit more\\u201d).\", \"The orchestra flew through one breathless passage in the second act, making a gallop to the final burst. \\u201cEcstatic and chaotic,\\u201d said N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin, 46, smiling from the podium. \\u201cIs this something we can do?\\u201d\", \"Chaos has lately dominated: The pandemic shut the Met for a year and a half. During much of that period, its unionized employees \\u2014 including orchestra musicians and choristers \\u2014 were furloughed without pay as a stalemate over compensation cuts dragged on.\", \"But the response to the company\\u2019s return has been ecstatic. And at the center of it all \\u2014 short and muscular, with close-cropped, bleached-blond hair and a taste for rehearsal athleisure \\u2014 is N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin. Omnipresent and energetic, he has been one of the central figures in New York\\u2019s cultural re-emergence, and certainly the city\\u2019s most significant and visible classical musician at a transformative moment.\", \"Over Labor Day weekend, shortly after the Met reached a deal with its unions, he conducted Mahler\\u2019s \\u201cResurrection\\u201d Symphony \\u2014 the first notes the company had played together since March 2020 \\u2014 in front of thousands outside the opera house. Audiences soon returned inside the theater to hear him lead a nationally telecast performance of Verdi\\u2019s Requiem, for the 20th anniversary of Sept. 11.\", \"Later that month, he began the Met\\u2019s season in earnest at the podium for Terence Blanchard and Kasi Lemmons\\u2019s \\u201cFire Shut Up in My Bones,\\u201d from 2019, the company\\u2019s first work by a Black composer. Nine days after that, he reopened Carnegie Hall with the Philadelphia Orchestra, of which he is also the music director, in the first of an astonishing nine dates for him at Carnegie this season. With the New York Philharmonic\\u2019s director, Jaap van Zweden, a newly declared lame duck, N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin is entering an era as the city\\u2019s presiding conductor, the one whose artistic achievements blur into civic stature.\", \"At the Met, he works from the ground-floor office once occupied by James Levine, who ruled the company for decades before being brought down by illness and allegations of sexual misconduct. Those troubles led N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin to ascend to the music directorship in 2018, two years ahead of schedule. Levine \\u2014 who rarely led contemporary operas, let alone two in two months \\u2014 died in March.\", \"There has been a major change to the office. At the start of a recent interview there, N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin mimed tearing down a set of bookshelves that had blocked the view of Damrosch Park.\", \"\\u201cIt feels symbolic,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt is to me. It\\u2019s about windows open and the fresh air of our repertoire and approach.\\u201d\", \"Despite the bright new light and the celebratory spirit of the past month and a half, the pandemic has been a dark period for N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin. During labor struggles, a music director\\u2019s position \\u2014 closely connected to the players, but at the same time part of the administration \\u2014 is intensely uncomfortable. There were musicians angry that N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin, who did not comment publicly on the negotiations until March, just after the orchestra agreed to begin accepting partial pay, was not earlier and louder in support.\", \"\\u201cIt is a position that is unenviable,\\u201d Gelb said in an interview. \\u201cAnd one I hated to see him in. I\\u2019m used to catching fire during these disputes, and I hated to see him get it, too. I tried to keep him out of it; it was unfair for him to be in the middle of it. But I was not very good at protecting him.\\u201d\", \"The experience was unsettling for an artist whose rise to the top of his profession has been swift and sunny, and who is unused to hostility from musicians. (They tend to venerate him: \\u201cHe\\u2019s the greatest conductor I\\u2019ve ever worked with,\\u201d said Harold Robinson, who is retiring as the Philadelphia Orchestra\\u2019s principal bass after 26 years.)\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t know what to expect coming in,\\u201d N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin said of the orchestra\\u2019s first rehearsal after the furlough ended. \\u201cI said very little at the beginning. I said: \\u2018We lost many people. We lost members of our company. We lost people in our families, our friends.\\u2019 And the first notes were Verdi, actually. We just played it through. Let\\u2019s put all our emotions in this. And it helped.\\u201d\", \"David Krauss, the Met\\u2019s principal trumpet, said in an interview: \\u201cThere was some tension in the first half of the first rehearsal back. And by the second half, it was back to business as usual.\\u201d\", \"Not exactly business as usual. The pandemic, and the calls for racial justice that flared last year, fast-tracked the Met premiere of \\u201cFire Shut Up in My Bones,\\u201d giving it pride of place on one of the highest-profile opening nights in the company\\u2019s history. The piece\\u2019s success \\u2014 reviews were positive, four of the eight performances sold out, and the crowds were markedly more diverse than usual \\u2014 has convinced N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin that works representing the experience of groups often marginalized in the classical canon, including Latinos and L.G.B.T. people, should be fixtures going forward.\", \"\\u201cThis is showing us what we need to do,\\u201d he said, \\u201cand confirming what I\\u2019ve been wanting from Day 1.\\u201d\", \"But one question is whether, without the burst of publicity that accompanied the Met\\u2019s belated presentation of a Black composer\\u2019s work, new operas can hold their own at the box office. (To be fair, even classics have struggled to sell in recent years.) Test cases will come: While N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin has his eye on little-done corners of the repertory \\u2014 he mentioned Gluck, Weber\\u2019s \\u201cDer Freisch\\u00fctz,\\u201d Korngold\\u2019s \\u201cDie Tote Stadt\\u201d and Ponchielli\\u2019s \\u201cLa Gioconda\\u201d \\u2014 he has decided that if the choice is between a rarity\\u2019s revival and a contemporary piece, the latter will get priority.\", \"\\u201cIt should be at the expense, maybe, of some stuff I had wanted to bring back,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cWe are reassessing all the operas I am going to be conducting,\\u201d he added, \\u201cbecause I don\\u2019t want this to be the exception, to do \\u2018Eurydice\\u2019 and \\u2018Fire.\\u2019 For me, this should be the norm. I had a lot of new pieces planned in the future. But I was maybe thinking I would do one a year, or skipping some years. And now, no.\\u201d\", \"Aucoin, the composer of \\u201cEurydice,\\u201d said that N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin is a collaborator \\u201cto a degree that\\u2019s unusual for conductors.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIn the chaotic dance scene in Act I,\\u201d he added, \\u201cthere\\u2019s this techno-esque line in the background, and my idea was that it should be only in the very bottom octave, the piano\\u2019s left hand and contrabassoons. I wanted it to be a pop song heard from another room. But it wasn\\u2019t registering. And he suggested we throw some bass trombone in there, and he was right.\\u201d\", \"On an early November afternoon in Philadelphia, N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin and his orchestra there presented an installment in the cycle of Beethoven symphonies they are also playing at Carnegie this season.\", \"Beethoven\\u2019s Second and Eighth framed \\u201cSermon,\\u201d a suite of arias and spoken texts about race and struggle organized and performed by the young bass-baritone Dav\\u00f3ne Tines. At its center is the calm, luminous sorrow of \\u201cVigil,\\u201d written by Igee Dieudonn\\u00e9 and Tines in memory of Breonna Taylor.\", \"New music can often feel randomly scattered onto an orchestral concert, added merely to give a progressive sheen to fundamentally conservative programming. But the mournful \\u201cSermon\\u201d felt at home among the symphonies, both complementing and in tension with them, particularly as they were played by the Philadelphians with such graceful, sweet-not-saccharine polish and \\u00e9lan. Old and new, life and death, coexisted and enhanced one another.\", \"\\u201cThat was the idea,\\u201d N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin said of Tines\\u2019s piece. \\u201cGiving him the space to tell us his story. I\\u2019m not a private, private person. I like to speak with you about my art; I like to go on television and share who I am as a person. But it\\u2019s not about me becoming more famous so that people give me attention. I\\u2019m not shying away from attention, but I want it to be helping the collective. I want to be the person who can help shed light on others.\\u201d\", \"At the end of February, N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin will achieve another repertory milestone at the Met, bringing Verdi\\u2019s \\u201cDon Carlos\\u201d there for the first time in its original French \\u2014 rather than in the more common Italian, as \\u201cDon Carlo.\\u201d A few weeks later, as part of what is intended to be an ongoing collaboration between his two American institutions \\u2014 he also leads the Orchestre M\\u00e9tropolitain of Montreal \\u2014 he and the Philadelphia Orchestra will give the world premiere of Kevin Puts and Greg Pierce\\u2019s opera adaptation of \\u201cThe Hours\\u201d in concert, before it is staged at the Met in a future season.\", \"The rebuilding of the Met is far from over. Eleven of its orchestra\\u2019s 96 regular full-time members retired or left their jobs during the pandemic. Should all be replaced? In what order? That is for N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin, in large part, to decide. And the company\\u2019s financial model, which keeps forcing the need for cuts and brinkmanship with the unions, is no closer to being permanently solved.\", \"\\u201cI can\\u2019t say we\\u2019re completely behind what happened last year,\\u201d N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not. But at least these moments \\u2014 this Verdi, this \\u2018Fire\\u2019 and now this \\u2018Eurydice\\u2019 \\u2014 are helping everyone focus on what matters to us and how we can function together. And making a difference. It sounds clich\\u00e9, but trying to make a difference in the world.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9a774eec492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9a774eec492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}},
