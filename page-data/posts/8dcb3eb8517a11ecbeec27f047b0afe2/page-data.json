I think that's how I'm going to have to play it from now on. It's an unfortunate reality, but it's my reality. And I understand it, and I accept it.\\\"\", \"Woods' rehabilitation process included a three-month stint in a homebound hospital bed. This eventually progressed to a wheelchair, and then a set of crutches.\", \"\\\"Adding that part into my day-to-day life was so rewarding because I'd been stuck in a house. Granted, it's a pretty nice house I've built for myself, but I hadn't been able to do the one thing I love to do: I love to go outside and just be outside,\\\" Woods told Golf Digest. \\\"Sometimes I just crutch and lay on the grass for an hour because I want to be outside. Missing the contact of a golf ball hit properly is one of the better feelings.\\\"\", \"The progress appears to be coming along well, as Woods recently tweeted a video that showed him swinging an iron.\", \"The famed golfer told the magazine that his father's regiment as a former military man helped Woods cope with the physical and emotional trauma that resulted from the crash. This, Woods said, helped him through some of his darkest days.\", \"\\\"Any [special forces] operator can attest to this\\u2014you don't know how long a firefight is gonna take. It could last five seconds or five hours and some could go on for days at a time,\\\" Woods said in his interview. \\\"With that in mind, you don't know when the end is so that's the hard part. How do you get through that?\\\"\", \"\\\"I just shortened up the windows of, oh, this is gonna be nine months of hell, to it's just two or three hours,\\\" he added.\"]","href_hash":"8dcb3eb8517a11ecbeec27f047b0afe2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8dcb3eb8517a11ecbeec27f047b0afe2"}},
