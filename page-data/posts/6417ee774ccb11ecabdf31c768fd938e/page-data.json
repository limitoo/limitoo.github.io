They have said they suspected Mr. Arbery of a series of break-ins in their subdivision of Satilla Shores, just outside the small coastal city of Brunswick, Ga., when they chased him through the neighborhood on a Sunday afternoon in February 2020.\", \"Earlier this week, Ms. Dunikoski argued that the men had attacked Mr. Arbery \\u201cbecause he was a Black man running down the street.\\u201d Robert Rubin, a lawyer for Travis McMichael, has said the men were acting on a \\u201cduty and responsibility\\u201d to protect their families and neighborhood.\", \"The jurors got the case midday Tuesday and headed home after 6 p.m., planning to resume deliberations on Wednesday morning. They have been hearing evidence and arguments since Nov. 5 and are now tasked with delivering a verdict in a case that helped fuel social justice protests across the United States in the spring and summer of 2020. More recently, the trial has been the focus of extensive cable television news coverage.\", \"Both prosecutors and the defense have some potential advantages as the jury deliberates. A number of legal experts believe that the white defendants may benefit from the fact that the jury is made up of 11 white residents of Glynn County, Ga., and one Black resident.\", \"The prosecution may benefit from having charged the men with felony murder. Unlike malice murder, prosecutors do not need to show \\u201cdeliberate intention\\u201d to kill to prove felony murder. Rather, they need only to show that a felony was committed, and that someone died as a result. In this case, if the jury finds a defendant guilty of one of the lesser felonies, like aggravated assault, jurors would then have the discretion to also find that defendant guilty of felony murder.\", \"For that reason, felony murder is \\u201ca very powerful tool in the prosecutor\\u2019s belt,\\u201d said Tanya Miller, an Atlanta criminal defense lawyer and former federal state and federal prosecutor. Often, Ms. Miller said, \\u201cjurors rightly or wrongly view felony murder a lesser charge than malice murder, because malice murder requires the intent to kill, and felony murder does not.\\u201d\", \"However, she noted, both malice murder and felony murder carry similar potential sentences. In this case, the men could face life in prison for felony murder alone.\", \"Ms. Dunikoski\\u2019s rebuttal on Tuesday morning restated some of her earlier arguments as to why reliance on the state\\u2019s citizen\\u2019s arrest law, which has since been largely gutted, was not applicable in this case. She focused on the idea that the men did not witness Mr. Arbery committing a crime that day and also lacked the \\u201cimmediate knowledge\\u201d that a crime had been committed \\u2014 the two scenarios, she said, under which the law allowed for a citizen\\u2019s arrest.\", \"She also rejected the idea that Mr. Arbery had been shot in self-defense.\", \"\\u201cYou can\\u2019t start something and claim self-defense,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd they started this.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Dunikoski challenged the defense\\u2019s depiction of Mr. Bryan, who had filmed the shooting and was described by his lawyer as \\u201cabsolutely superfluous and irrelevant to the tragic death of Ahmaud Arbery.\\u201d\", \"She also spent significant time focusing on the other man who did not pull a trigger that day, Gregory McMichael. She noted Mr. McMichael\\u2019s statement that Mr. Arbery had been \\u201ctrapped like a rat\\u201d before he was killed, citing it as an acknowledgment of false imprisonment. And she noted that Mr. McMichael had called Mr. Arbery an \\u201casshole\\u201d shortly after the shooting.\", \"\\u201cMalice, right there,\\u201d Ms. Dunikoski said of Mr. McMichael\\u2019s behavior.\", \"The charge of malice murder is defined in Georgia law as causing a person\\u2019s death with deliberate intention, without considerable provocation, and \\u201cwhere all the circumstances of the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Dunikoski beseeched jurors to find the men guilty on the facts, and not because they were \\u201cgood or bad\\u201d people.\", \"\\u201cNobody gets a free pass,\\u201d she said, adding that the case was \\u201cabout holding people accountable and responsible for their actions.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6417ee774ccb11ecabdf31c768fd938e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6417ee774ccb11ecabdf31c768fd938e"}},
