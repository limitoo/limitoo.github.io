She suggests trying a group of all black-and-white artworks or of pieces that are body-centric, that include, for example, a hand or profile.\", \"After choosing the pieces you want to hang, shuffle them around on the floor until you like a composition. Start at the bottom, in the center, and work up and out. Don\\u2019t center the biggest piece of art. \\u201cIt can create a massive focal point and everything else becomes almost peripheral,\\u201d Lemaitre says. One way to organize a cluster is by keeping the spacing between pieces consistent; another is to line up the tops, bottoms or sides of several pieces. \", \"Once you\\u2019ve settled on an arrangement that you like, cut out pieces of brown paper that match the sizes of the things you want to hang and tape them to the wall. This, Lemaitre says, lets you \\u201cget a feel for the pieces\\u201d \\u2014 that is, check the layout before you put them up.\", \"If your space is limited and the cluster includes a wall-mounted television, make sure it is not at the center. \\u201cIt can really participate in the hang, and not be a disservice to the hang, as long as it\\u2019s included in a way that doesn\\u2019t crush everything around it,\\u201d Lemaitre says. Ultimately, though, what you display, and how, depends on your own personal feeling, she says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a little bit like composing a painting and should be seen as one artwork made of multiple works.\\u201d\", \"\"]","href_hash":"9c97964d5cc811ec9d251f7281e97d2c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9c97964d5cc811ec9d251f7281e97d2c"}},
