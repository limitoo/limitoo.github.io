Not so inside, where the Sandbox quartet had put in earplugs to rehearse Andy Akiho\\u2019s clangorous \\u201cSeven Pillars,\\u201d a lush, brooding celebration of noise.\", \"Akiho, 42, an increasingly in-demand composer who rose as a steel pan virtuoso, sat watching, with a surfer\\u2019s laid-back demeanor but intently focused. He isn\\u2019t part of the group, but over the years has grown so close with its members, and has spent so much time in their studio, that he installed an espresso machine to fuel his work marathons there.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s my bedroom,\\u201d he said, pointing to a tiny soundproofed recording space walled off in the corner.\", \"Akiho has written substantial works for steel pan, for percussion, for marimba and string quartet, for snare drum and sampled dog barking, and many other configurations \\u2014 even a concerto for onstage Ping-Pong players and orchestra. But \\u201cSeven Pillars\\u201d is a breakthrough for him, in its 80-minute length and its conceptual complexity.\", \"It is being unveiled as a live theatrical event staged by Michael McQuilken, with striking lights synchronized with the music, in Seattle on Friday, and will tour in the coming years. But because of the pandemic, it was first released in September as a recording, with accompanying short films. The album has been nominated for two Grammy Awards: One of the categories, best contemporary classical composition, specifically honors Akiho, and the other, best chamber music/small ensemble performance, Sandbox Percussion.\", \"This is an appropriate balance, since \\u201cSeven Pillars\\u201d is an auteur\\u2019s vision that was also shaped through an unusually close collaboration with its performers. (Displaying a video clip of a 2019 workshop session, time-stamped at 12:59 a.m., the Sandbox player Ian David Rosenbaum said, \\u201cWe were just getting started.\\u201d) Akiho and the group bundled together for stretches of the lockdown with their producer, Sean Dixon, working on the recording at Avaloch Farm Music Institute in rural New Hampshire.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re not interested in that kind of relationship where we just get a piece,\\u201d said Victor Caccese, another Sandbox member, who for \\u201cSeven Pillars\\u201d developed a customized table of tuned metal pipes. (Jonny Allen and Terry Sweeney round out the ensemble.)\", \"The 11-part work has a palindromic structure, with the \\u201cpillars\\u201d \\u2014 all written for more than one musician \\u2014 interspersed with four solos, each of which introduces a new instrument into the mix. Starting with a pair of pounding, echoing beats, the raucous relentlessness of \\u201cPillar I\\u201d gives way to the first of the solos: the gentle, jeweled reticence of \\u201cAmethyst,\\u201d for vibraphone.\", \"In the otherworldly \\u201cPillar II,\\u201d which dissolves into a dizzying kaleidoscope of high-pitched chirps, the edges of a vibraphone are bowed \\u2014 not an unusual effect in contemporary percussion music. What is unusual is that Akiho asks not for a generalized airy sound, but for precisely notated rhythms.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t know it was possible to play those rhythms with a bow,\\u201d Rosenbaum said. \\u201cHe will create a vocabulary, and then create beautiful music using that vocabulary.\\u201d\", \"Akiho has an uncanny gift for intricate rhythmic counterpoint, though the mathematical precision of the final product emerged through epic stretches of stream-of-consciousness play. Developing \\u201cSeven Pillars,\\u201d he would keep his iPhone camera trained on himself as he banged and noodled, making something like eight hours of improvised video at a time and sleeping at the foot of whichever instrument he was working on.\", \"\\u201cPillar III,\\u201d mixing antsy chimes and a low-slung beat below, is an interplay of lines that shouldn\\u2019t fit together but do. After the piece builds in force, it finally collapses in ferocious shudders, explosions and shivers before an ominous lullaby. The score asks one of the players to run sticks along the vibraphone pipes. But on that September Sunday, Akiho also experimented with hammering on the pipes.\", \"\\u201cFor someone to be playing one of these instruments with a hammer is, even for us, unconventional,\\u201d Caccese said with a grin.\", \"\\u201cSpiel\\u201d conveys both the toylike quality and jittery anxiety, the sweet tones and clipped tapping, of the glockenspiel. \\u201cPillar IV,\\u201d the center of the palindrome \\u2014 and, at 11 and a half minutes, the longest section \\u2014 is the grandest expression of the work\\u2019s mixture of sinister darkness, stained-glass glinting and communal energy.\", \"After that intensity comes the relief of \\u201cmARImbA,\\u201d which is, as the title hints, a longing aria for its instrument, an exploration of the different textures of bowed and struck tones, trembling waves of sound and lonely echoes. The sly, light \\u201cPillar V,\\u201d with its cascades of chimes, leads to \\u201cPillar VI,\\u201d more ruminative than the others; the shadowy tangle of \\u201ccarTogRAPh\\u201d; and the fluttering hush of \\u201cPillar VII.\\u201d\", \"Akiho lived in Italy in 2014 and \\u201915 as a winner of the Rome Prize, and he mused that there may be some subconscious connection between the Pantheon\\u2019s pillars and his musical ones. But \\u201cSeven Pillars\\u201d is pretty much as pure as music gets \\u2014 it\\u2019s only \\u201cabout\\u201d its own structure and self-imposed constrictions.\", \"He and Sandbox admit that the work would be an easier sell to grant makers and presenters if there was a narrative behind it, and at one point in the writing process he flirted with imposing a concept based on the seven Japanese gods of fortune.\", \"\\u201cBut that\\u2019s not really who I am,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI would be lying to myself and the audience.\\u201d\", \"It wasn\\u2019t so many years before his Rome Prize that Akiho didn\\u2019t think of himself as a composer at all. He grew up in Columbia, S.C.; his white Southern mother met his father, a Japanese hibachi chef, when she went out to eat.\", \"Akiho\\u2019s father wasn\\u2019t in the picture for much of his childhood, and his older sister helped raise him; she was into rock drumming and introduced him to her kit. In high school, he dived into the world of drum lines, and at the University of South Carolina stumbled on an unexpectedly rich musical environment for a school without a conservatory. There was West African drumming, jazz ensembles and, crucially, steel pan, for which Akiho quickly showed an affinity.\", \"\\u201cI became the steel pan guy,\\u201d he said over onigiri after the Sandbox rehearsal. Akiho traveled to Trinidad to experience large pan ensembles, then moved to New York in 2003. He played with bands in Crown Heights, Brooklyn; did cocktail party and wedding gigs; and helped to organize a steel pan program in two public schools.\", \"Reunited a few years later with his father, who was living in Washington, Akiho briefly went to work there as a sushi chef. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like music,\\u201d he recalled realizing. \\u201cI could devote the rest of my life to doing this. But I have to pick one or the other; I can\\u2019t do both. So I picked music.\\u201d\", \"He hadn\\u2019t had to read a score in years, but was accepted into the contemporary performance program at Manhattan School of Music as his class\\u2019s only percussionist, which placed him in high demand as a player. The program didn\\u2019t focus on composition, but after full days of classes, he would go home and write.\", \"Having met the renowned composer Julia Wolfe, he began to study with her on the side, bartering rhythm lessons for her children. \\u201cI had creative ideas, but I didn\\u2019t know what I was doing yet,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd her vibe was not trying to sculpt me into a specific dogma.\\u201d\", \"Wolfe, one of the Bang on a Can trio of composers, offered entree to that group\\u2019s rock-tinged and proudly genre-crossing world. Then, in 2009, Akiho started a master\\u2019s program in composition at Yale University. He began to write pieces in which he wasn\\u2019t also featured as a performer.\", \"A few years ago, he moved to Portland, Ore., where he knew some people, including a friend who plays timpani with the Oregon Symphony. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a year or two younger than me,\\u201d Akiho said, but the timpanist and his wife \\u201ckind of almost adopted me. They feel like family to me.\\u201d\", \"That grounding has helped \\u2014 as has hiring an assistant \\u2014 as Akiho tries to get more of a handle on a booming career that has escalated almost out of control. He is an inveterate procrastinator, regularly crashing deadlines only to face others he\\u2019s blown past.\", \"\\u201cI would go a year without looking at email,\\u201d he said, shaking his head in disbelief. \\u201cLike, it was bad. I had an email from Jon Batiste for, like, months, and I didn\\u2019t even see it, talking about maybe doing a recording. And I was like, I need to get my life together.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cA lot of times you can think you need that hectic kind of life or your stuff won\\u2019t be good,\\u201d he added. \\u201cBut I think when I\\u2019m healthy I write better, and I\\u2019m happier with what I\\u2019m doing. It\\u2019s more about enjoying the journey than trying to get to the finish line and crashing.\\u201d\", \"He dreams about collaborations beyond the classical world with artists like Batiste and \\u2014 the ideal \\u2014 Kendrick Lamar. He wrote music for a coming dance by Benjamin Millepied. And with the Industry, an avant-garde opera company in Los Angeles, he workshopped an adaptation of Brecht\\u2019s \\u201cLife of Galileo.\\u201d (He\\u2019s also just a dissertation away from earning his doctorate from Princeton.)\", \"\\u201cI want to go to Japan for a while, maybe several months or something, and collaborate over there,\\u201d he said. \\u201cGet more in touch with those roots and the traditional music.\\u201d\", \"The deadline for \\u201cSeven Pillars,\\u201d the premiere of which was scheduled for last year, was suddenly lifted because of the pandemic. So it got around Akiho\\u2019s usual practice of rushing works to completion, and allowed for the communal development with Sandbox that now infuses it. His past music lacked neither vigor nor reverie, but here he casts a new kind of spell, a trance experienced by four players at once.\", \"\\u201cIt wouldn\\u2019t have been as personal\\u201d without the space the piece was given, Akiho said. \\u201cIt wouldn\\u2019t have been as deep.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4a83e320535b11ecae47fb21c8804243"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4a83e320535b11ecae47fb21c8804243"}},
