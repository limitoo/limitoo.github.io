I mean sure, it might be a little substandard, but you can\\u2019t mess up a flat white too much.\", \"Then I got there, had a sip of the brewed brown swill they like to drink and realized that it was really that bad.\", \"Australian coffee has become something of a global phenomenon, most recently evidenced by the flat whites our delegation gave out at the COP26 meeting and which reportedly were a resounding success. (Unlike the rest of Australia\\u2019s performance at the climate summit).\", \"Over the last decade or two, Aussie-run cafes have popped up around the world. Our coffee is slowly being embraced by Americans. In 2015, Starbucks started selling \\u201cAustralian style\\u201d flat whites, reigniting a fierce debate about whether it originated in Australia or New Zealand.\", \"Our coffee culture, particularly in places like Melbourne, is world-class. The story of how it developed speaks to both our immigrant past and our willingness to go at things our own way instead of following tradition.\", \"According to historians, it started after World War II, when Italian migrants brought with them espresso machines and the European cafe culture.\", \"\\u201cThe introduction of espresso coffee in the 1950s is nostalgically remembered by many as a key watershed between a drab past and a cosmopolitan present,\\u201d Andrew May, a historian at the University of Melbourne, said via email.\", \"But it wasn\\u2019t quick to take off, he added. \\u201cThere was also still a lot of racism toward Italian migrants. So it was a slow burn really, and the next wave of inner-city rejuvenation and gentrification from the early 1980s \\u2014 a new wave of Bohemian cafes \\u2014 gave coffee another significant boost.\\u201d\", \"Our love for velvety, milky coffee came from the marriage of Italian espresso and the existing British tradition of drinking tea and instant coffee with milk. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve perfected the milk side of coffee because we\\u2019re a milk drinking nation,\\u201d said Bruno Maiolo, the president of the Australian Specialty Coffee Association.\", \"And how did Australian coffee go to the next level? It\\u2019s because baristas and roasters have been willing to push the boundaries, always experimenting and refining, he said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re new and young and hip and always asking questions about every piece of the puzzle.\\u201d\", \"This willingness to mix-and-match and experiment is a running theme in Australian food culture, said Emma Felton, a sociologist from the Queensland University of Technology.\", \"\\u201cYou look at countries like France or any European country and they\\u2019re much more hidebound. Their culture is much more rigid, so they don\\u2019t have as much experimentation, with their food in particular.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t have to conform so much because we\\u2019re a nation of immigrants,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe really pick-and-grab from all over the world.\\u201d\", \"At home, Australians don\\u2019t think of ourselves as a nation of coffee connoisseurs, she added, but we usually are by default, because of the high standard we are accustomed to.\", \"Do you have anything you took for granted in Australia until you saw how other countries did it?
