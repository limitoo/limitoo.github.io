Here is a collection of past columns.\", \"When people younger than 18 record videos and add them to YouTube, the public can no longer watch them. TikTok says it will stop sending app notifications to teenagers at night. Facebook and Google have sharply restricted the ways that advertisers can tailor messages to minors on their sites.\", \"In recent months, internet companies have reworked their apps and policies to try to better protect the safety, privacy and mental health of children. One big reason is Britain.\", \"In September, new guidelines went into effect in the country that may be the world\\u2019s most sweeping digital protections aimed at kids. As in the examples above, the British regulations \\u2014 formally called the Age-Appropriate Design Code or the Children\\u2019s Code \\u2014 are also changing the internet experience for kids and families in the U.S. and other countries.\", \"I\\u2019ll explain more about the British protections and why their effects have spread. Children\\u2019s advocates are mostly over the moon about it.\", \"One main takeaway is that as U.S. lawmakers are debating updated laws to protect kids online and scolding the head of Instagram, as they did on Wednesday, the horse has partly left the barn. Britain is essentially dictating how U.S. internet companies should protect American children.\", \"What\\u2019s in this British regulation:\", \"The idea behind the Children\\u2019s Code is that companies must build products with the best interests of children in mind, and it makes companies accountable to protect them. The regulations don\\u2019t take all control and responsibility from parents and caregivers, but they are a backstop for families.\", \"Among other guidelines, the code requires websites and apps to turn on the highest possible privacy settings by default for people under 18, and to turn off features that track children\\u2019s locations. Digital services must collect as little information as possible about kids.\", \"Some of the guidelines are vague, partly by design, and that\\u2019s one reason the technology industry said it fought the British code. It was adopted last year after a messy process.\", \"It\\u2019s too soon to assess how effective the guidelines will be and how they will be enforced. And there are trade-offs. As companies try more aggressive age verification methods, partly in keeping with the British standards and other regulations, it may compromise anonymity online.\", \"But most advocates for children believe the guidelines are a thoughtful approach to remodeling the internet for potentially vulnerable young people. \\u201cWe definitely are fans,\\u201d James P. Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense Media, told me.\", \"Why has this spread globally?\", \"To comply with the British code, Facebook, Google and other companies could have changed features only for kids who live in that country. But practically and philosophically, that might have been a bad choice.\", \"There is growing support among lawmakers and tech executives for different features and safeguards to protect children from sexual predators, inappropriate content, bullying and other risks from being online. \", \"Internet companies know that more regulations like Britain\\u2019s are most likely coming, so it may be prudent to act of their own accord. \\u201cI think they can see the writing on the wall,\\u201d Sonia Livingstone, a professor at the London School of Economics who studies children\\u2019s digital rights, told Wired this year.\", \"What is Washington doing?\", \"Members of Congress are deliberating potential updates to the U.S. law for comprehensive online child protection, the Children\\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act. The 1990s law compelled most popular online services in the U.S. to bar users who are younger than 13. But we know that many American kids are online with or without their parents\\u2019 permission. The question now is what more could or should be done to help make them safer online.\", \"In a video from The New York Times Opinion section, my colleagues made the case that Congress should copy the British regulations. Some U.S. lawmakers have essentially proposed that. \\u201cWhy not here?\\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, asked at Wednesday\\u2019s hearing, referring to the British code.\", \"The British regulations are effectively here already, but without the force of U.S. law. Steyer said he was frustrated that Congress hadn\\u2019t yet passed new child safety laws but believed they would be coming very soon. \\u201c2022 is going to be very important here for tech legislation and regulation,\\u201d he said.\", \"Are you planning air travel in the next few weeks? Brian X. Chen, the consumer technology columnist for The New York Times, has a handy suggestion for organizing your travel itinerary.\", \"I recently suggested ways to carry proof of Covid vaccinations on your smartphone in case you need it when you roam away from home. Today I have a tip for another major pain of traveling: keeping track of your itinerary.\", \"I turn to technology for taming the sprawl of information like airline flight numbers, hotel addresses, rental car information and more. In the coronavirus pandemic era, airline officials are asking for this information from international travelers to help with contact tracing. And it\\u2019s useful anyway to have all your travel info close at hand.\", \"The free app TripIt is my favorite way to do that. After setting up an account, you can forward emails related to your trip, including flight confirmations, lodging and rental car information, to plans@tripit.com.\", \"The app organizes all that information automatically into an all-in-one itinerary that looks like a timeline. It\\u2019s a neat and simple way to find your travel records quickly when you need them.\", \"We want to hear from our readers about the ways that you\\u2019re using technology (apps, social media, websites, gadgets or more) to help you plan your travel, parties, shopping or family time this holiday season.
