They said Mr. Rogan had a \\u201cconcerning history\\u201d of advancing inaccurate claims on his podcast, particularly about the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cBy allowing the propagation of false and societally harmful assertions, Spotify is enabling its hosted media to damage public trust in scientific research and sow doubt in the credibility of data-driven guidance offered by medical professionals,\\u201d the letter said. It also called on the company \\u201cto immediately establish a clear and public policy to moderate misinformation on its platform.\\u201d\", \"Spotify declined to comment on the record. The company has said that it prohibits dangerous, false or deceptive content about Covid-19 that may cause offline harm or pose a threat to public health.\", \"According to the letter, Dr. Malone promoted \\u201cseveral falsehoods about COVID-19 vaccines\\u201d on the Dec. 31 episode of Mr. Rogan\\u2019s show, including a widely discredited theory that societal leaders have \\u201chypnotized\\u201d millions of people.\", \"PolitiFact reported earlier this month that Dr. Malone was banned from Twitter for violating the company\\u2019s misinformation policy against Covid-19, and that YouTube removed videos of an interview he did with Mr. Rogan.\", \"Mr. Rogan\\u2019s show is effectively a series of wandering conversations on topics including but not limited to comedy, cage-fighting, psychedelics, quantum mechanics and criticism of the political left. The show was licensed to Spotify in 2020 in a deal estimated to be worth $100 million. Last spring, Mr. Rogan drew the ire of the Biden administration and Prince Harry, another Spotify podcaster, for comments undermining the value of vaccinations for young, healthy people.\", \"As of Friday evening, the episode of the show featuring Dr. Malone was still available to stream on Spotify.\"]","href_hash":"2bcdfd8a761011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2bcdfd8a761011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
