game that does not pay out real money.\", \"Rachel Naomi Perri appeared in the Supreme Court in Hobart on Monday, charged with 25 counts of computer-related fraud and one count of fraud.\", \"The 49-year-old stole the money while working as an account manager at the Tasmanian Veterinary Hospital between 2016 and 2019.\\u00a0\", \"It was only after she was made redundant in 2019 that \\\"anomalies were discovered in banking transactions\\\".\", \"A further investigation revealed the full extent of her theft.\\u00a0\", \"Crown prosecutor Simone Wilson told the court that, over a period of three years and four months, Perri\\u00a0made 475 fraudulent transactions, stealing a total of $940,221.\\u00a0\", \"Ms Wilson told the court that Perri, who was the sole person in charge of managing accounts, was transferring the money from the hospital's bank account to a variety of bank accounts, credit cards and personal loans in her name.\", \"Police also discovered that, in 2015, Perri had fraudulently taken out a $30,000 credit card in her husband's name without his knowledge and racked up about $24,000 in debt.\", \"In November 2019, she was interviewed by police and \\\"immediately said, 'I'm guilty'\\\".\", \"Ms Wilson told the court Perri informed police that she had been playing a gambling game known as Heart of Vegas for the past four years and that was where all the money had gone.\", \"\\\"It is similar to playing pokies and you shop to purchase coins or credits,\\\" she told the court.\", \"Heart of Vegas describes itself as featuring \\\"real Vegas slot machines just like the ones you know and love\\\".\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7b859829513b39deeb05ff1184b18c36\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The Heart Of Vegas charges a fee to obtain virtual items but never\\u00a0pays out \\\"real world\\\" money.(Facebook: Heart Of Vegas)</div>\", \"In its terms and conditions, it says players \\\"may be required to pay a fee to obtain virtual items\\\" but \\\"regardless of the terminology used, virtual items may never be redeemed for 'real world' money\\\".\", \"Reading out Perri's interview with police to the court, Ms Wilson said the accused\\u00a0was in her \\\"own little world\\\" when playing the game.\", \"\\\"I got myself into so much trouble but decided I'd keep going until [I] got caught,\\\" she had said in the record of interview.\", \"Ms Wilson said Perri had admitted that she was \\\"humiliated\\\" and could not believe what she had done.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Gambling app left on auto as she slept</div>\", \"Perri's lawyer, Greg Barns, told the court she had a \\\"lengthy history of gambling\\\".\", \"\\\"It started when she went to Launceston Casino on the day she turned 18,\\\" he told the court.\", \"Mr Barns told the court she \\\"got herself into considerable trouble in the 90s\\\", referring to the time Perri was convicted for stealing $7,000 in cash from her employer.\", \"He\\u00a0said his client\\u00a0moved to Hobart for a fresh start but returned to gambling in 2008-09.\", \"\\\"She described spending consecutive hours on poker machines,\\\" he told the court.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"One session she spent 16 hours continuously playing on the machine.\\\"\", \"Mr Barns said Perri\\u00a0got herself into about $200,000 in debt on that occasion and, at one stage, had nine credit cards, but there was no evidence of offending.\", \"In 2014, she discovered Heart of Vegas, the game that \\\"brought her before the court\\\".\", \"\\\"You don't actually win any money,\\\" Mr Barns said.\", \"\\\"You have to purchase tokens and you get virtual coins that allow you to play the game\\u00a0and, if you win, you get virtual coins as winnings, but [they]\\u00a0can't be redeemed for any monetary benefit.\\\"\", \"Mr Barns said the point of the game was to just \\\"keep playing the game\\\".\", \"\\\"She got so addicted that she'd play it first thing in morning,\\\" he told the court.\", \"\\\"She was using this to such an extent that she'd again taken out multiple credit cards and personal loans.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It turned into what is, admittedly, very serious fraud activity.\\\"\", \"Perri was diagnosed by forensic psychiatrist Dr Michael Jordan as having a severe gambling disorder.\", \"\\\"He considered that Perri's gambling disorder was the most significant factor in her fraud activity,\\\" Mr Barns told the court.\", \"Mr Barns told the court Perri\\u00a0had voluntarily entered therapy and it would need to continue once in prison.\", \"He said she was depressed, her marriage had broken up and she knew she would be given a \\\"lengthy prison sentence\\\".\", \"The veterinary services has instituted civil proceedings to try to\\u00a0recover the money, but Mr Barns said it was unlikely Perri\\u00a0would be able to pay back her former employer.\\u00a0\", \"Ms Wilson told the court Perri only stopped because she was made redundant, not voluntarily.\", \"\\\"It was planned, calculated systematic conduct where the accused employed multiple accounting [techniques and the books were]\\u00a0consistently balanced,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"There were no suspicions raised by partners or external accountants due to the methodology and complexity [of the fraud transactions].\\\"\", \"Perri has been remanded in custody to be sentenced next month.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"b61fc2014bc911ec83903b981795bf52"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b61fc2014bc911ec83903b981795bf52"}},
