That border would be secure the next day.\\\"\", \"His anti-immigration plan also prohibits state or local agencies from working with entities that help resettle \\\"illegal aliens into Florida.\\\" Additionally, the governor proposed ordering jails and courts to gather immigration status information at the time of arrests and convictions.\", \"He also wants to improve Florida's E-Verify procedures by making the state Department of Economic Opportunity \\\"an agency eligible to conduct enforcement.\\\"\", \"\\\"We're going to provide resources, we're going to provide money to be able to get what we [want]. What we don't want is incentivizing people to be coming to the state illegally,\\\" the governor said on Friday.\", \"No details were reported about the way the proposed immigration reforms will be carried out in the state, including how undocumented migrants will be tracked and later transported out of Florida.\", \"For the proposed program to go into effect, the Legislature has to first approve the funding and the operation's details, according to the Miami Herald.\", \"DeSantis also proposed improving Florida's sanctuary cities law, which bans contractors involved in what he described as illegal immigration from doing any business in the state.\", \"\\\"We just cannot be doing contracts with companies that are knowingly and recklessly facilitating bringing people here into our state illegally,\\\" he said. He added that those \\\"involved in facilitating illegal migration into Florida\\\" will be required to pay restitution.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949572/desantis-wants-removeillegal-migrants-florida.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is requesting $8 million in federal funding to transport migrants out of the state.

According to the Herald, state Representative Anna Eskamani, a Democrat, said that the requested budget is \\\"basically $8 million for his political campaign. There are some serious human rights concerns. Are you going to put someone in a car and drive them to Delaware?... State officials are not trained on any type of immigration enforcement.\\\"\", \"U.S. Representative John Rutherford, a Florida Republican, praised DeSantis' proposal and said that he is \\\"thankful\\\" that the governor is \\\"putting the safety of Floridians first and is fighting back against the Biden open border agenda.\\\"\", \"\\\"This crisis at the southern border is not the result of a failed policy from the Biden Administration \\u2014 it is their policy.
