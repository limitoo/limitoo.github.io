The country has already been under a partial lockdown since November 13.\", \"Gommers said that many ICU staff are currently not working because they're either sick or they have children who tested positive and have to self-quarantine, putting further stress on the hospitals.\", \"Over the last week, children aged from 5 to 11 had the highest rates of infections in the country. There has been a 39 percent spike in infections over the past week, according to the country's public health institute.\", \"The Dutch government made social distancing mandatory on Wednesday for all adults in places where COVID passes are not required.
