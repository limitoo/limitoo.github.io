The opportunity came from the UNC to create a MOU. Any French nationals that are in New Zealand will be able to approach the RSA for support if they so desire, and in reverse, in France New Zealand veterans who are over there will be able to approach the UNC should they need some support as well.\\\"\", \"While the relationship between the two organisations had always been strong, it was now firmly cemented, he said.\", \"''New Zealand has a rich history in supporting France in its time of need and I think that being able to support their veterans in this time is also significant.''\", \"The UNC representative in New Zealand, Graham Yarrall, said the MOU was an acknowledgement both organisations had similar goals.\", \"''If we can co-operate to achieve those goals for each other, like New Zealand veterans who may be in France, or French veterans who may be in New Zealand, they can reach out for assistance.
