And I think I made a smart-aleck remark and said somethin', like, \\\"You think? \\u00a0Yeah \\u2026 you need to do that.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"There were some not-so-subtle signs that there were problems in Don and Carole's marriage. There was that cryptic warning Gladys said she was given not to be alone with Carole.

He didn't \\u2014 like the way she spent money. \\u00a0\", \"The couple also reportedly fought about what to do with the animals. Carole wanted to keep them and make Easy Street a sanctuary. Don, so the story goes, wanted to breed and sell them. He had talked about getting a divorce, and if he had gone through with it, it could have been costly, says Don's lawyer Joe Fritz.\", \"Richard Schlesinger: So, she would've lost a considerable amount of money?\\u00a0\", \"Joseph Fritz:\\u00a0Millions.\\u00a0\", \"Richard Schlesinger: That's considerable.\\u00a0\", \"Joseph Fritz: That's considerable.\\u00a0\", \"The couple made a lot of money while they were together. But it turned out there were more signs of trouble. After Don disappeared, Anne McQueen says she remembered a sealed envelope that he had given her two months earlier.\\u00a0\", \"Anne McQueen: He came to the office, and he was agitated, and he gave me an envelope. And he said, \\\"Take this. Keep it in a safe place \\\"\\u2026 He either said, \\\"Take it to the police, or you'll know what to do with it \\u2014 if anything ever happens.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Anne McQueen: I took it home\\u2026.

Carole had set it off. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Carole got in with help from her father and Don's handyman, a man named Kenny Farr, and when Anne got back to the office, she says she was shocked.\", \"Anne McQueen: Everything was gone. Everything that was in my desk was gone.\", \"Including, she says, Don's will and power of attorney. Police said Carole's action was legal. After all, she was Don's wife. But Don's daughters were suspicious.\\u00a0\", \"Lynda Sanchez:\\u00a0Well, to us it's very odd. She may be a spouse, but she did not have a key at all to the gate or the office. So that says a lot right there. \\u00a0\", \"But that's not the only odd thing. Carole gave an interview to the television show \\\"Hard Copy,\\\" suggesting Don might have had some kind of dementia:\", \"CAROLE BASKIN [in tears on \\\"Hard Copy\\\"]: Maybe he doesn't know who he is. Maybe he doesn't know where to call home.\\u00a0\", \"But Don's lawyer Joseph Fritz says Don had no memory problems. \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Joe Fritz: Absolutely none. \\u00a0\", \"Richard Schlesinger: Did you see him shortly before he disappeared? \\u00a0\", \"Joe Fritz: I saw him at least every week and sometimes two or three times.\", \"And Don's family doesn't believe Carole was really worried about Don, in part, because they say weeks after he disappeared, she canceled Don's cell phone account.\", \"Gale Rathbone: If a person \\u2014 at the beginning, your husband, you think he has dementia, he's got Alzheimer's, and now he's missing, do you turn his cell phone off after two or three weeks of him being missing? His only lifeline to reach you?\\u00a0\", \"Donna Pettis:\\u00a0 She turned it off. Three weeks after \\u2026\\u00a0\", \"Gale Rathbone: Cancelled the account.\\u00a0\", \"As the weeks turned into months, Carole offered another possibility. Instead of Costa Rica, maybe Don was under arrest in Mexico and couldn't call her. \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"CAROLE BASKIN [WTSP news report]: The only place I still haven't looked that I feel somewhat hopeful of being able to find him alive is gonna be Mexico, and I don't know how hard or how long that'll take.\", \"REPORTER: You think maybe a prison?\\u00a0\", \"CAROLE BASKIN: Yeah. I can't think of anything else that would keep him away this long \\u2026 I find it hard to believe he'd walk away and leave me.\", \"Don's family began to think the worst \\u2014 that Don was dead, and that Carole played a role in his death.\", \"Richard Schlesinger: What was your first thought?\\u00a0\", \"Gladys Lewis Cross: I would love to tell you, but I better not.\\u00a0\", \"Richard Schlesinger: Can you give me a hint?\\u00a0\", \"Gladys Lewis Cross: You've got it.\\u00a0\", \"Richard Schlesinger: You thought it was her?\\u00a0\", \"Gladys Lewis Cross: I can't say that.\\u00a0\", \"Richard Schlesinger: Would I be wrong in assuming that that was your first thought?\\u00a0\", \"Gladys Lewis Cross: Maybe.\\u00a0\", \"Richard Schlesinger: Maybe I'd be wrong?\\u00a0\", \"Gladys Lewis Cross:\\u00a0Maybe you might be right.\\u00a0\", \"And then, the case took a turn. Police found Don's van abandoned at a remote airport; the keys were reportedly still in it. Remember, Don had been planning to go to Costa Rica for work.\", \"Gale Rathbone: There is the theory that he just got tired of everything and jumped in an airplane and flew to Costa Rica and drove up the mountain and is living happily ever after there. \\u00a0\", \"Don had owned several planes and he loved to fly.\\u00a0\", \"Joe Solan has flown hundreds of hours in one type of plane that Don Lewis liked to fly: a Piper Arrow 3.\", \"Joe Solan: You can roughly get about 700 miles to a full tank, the two main tanks full.\", \"Richard Schlesinger: So, if, say you were going to go from the Tampa area down to Costa Rica. It's not a nonstop flight.\", \"Joe Solan: No, no [laughs].\", \"Richard Schlesinger: So that's like how many refueling stops?\\u00a0\", \"Joe Solan: Oh, probably three to at four least.\", \"If he did refuel, no one seems to know about it. Besides, Don's family says he would never just take off and leave them. But if Don didn't just fly off to begin a new life somewhere, what was his van doing at the airport? \\u00a0\", \"Joe Fritz: I've heard, at the time \\u2026 that he was strangled from the backseat of an airplane with an electric cord and pushed out 50 feet over the Gulf.\\u00a0\", \"Correspondent Richard Schlesinger is also a pilot and flies the same type of plane Don often flew.\", \"Richard Schlesinger\\u00a0[flying plane]: First of all, imagine the struggle involved in strangling a 170-pound man in this passenger seat. Then, if the plan was to push him out the door, that's a challenge. The slowest this airplane can fly is about 65 mph, and that means winds approaching hurricane strength would be pushing against this door trying to keep it closed. You'd have to open it. You'd have to keep it open, and you'd have to somehow wrestle the body out of here without interfering with the flight controls. Bottom line: I guess you could do it, but there are easier ways to get rid of a body.\\u202f\\u00a0\", \"And there was no evidence that any of Don's planes were missing. So, if it's unlikely Don Lewis was pushed out of a small airplane. Where was he? \", \"In the summer of 1997, Carole spoke with the local Fox TV station. \\u00a0\", \"CAROLE BASKIN [Fox interview]: I'm very worried. \\u2026 It's just a feeling \\u2026 that he is OK, that he will just walk back in the gate. \\u00a0\", \"But Don never did.\", \"Alex Spiro: It's very hard in the 21st century to go missing, missing as a middle-aged man who has a very active cellular records, banking records, et cetera. \", \"Alex Spiro is an attorney. A former New York City prosecutor, he's now working for Don Lewis' daughters. \", \"Richard Schlesinger: There're all sorts of\\u2014 theories about what might have happened \\u2014 to Don. One of them \\u2014 was that he was tossed out of an airplane. Do you find that credible?\", \"Alex Spiro: Sometimes in high-profile cases, people come up with fanciful theories of, you know, tigers, lions, bears, and airplanes. I mean, there's usually a simpler explanation of things.\", \"Spiro says the simplest thing of all is to start with the timeline of the day Don Lewis vanished. \\u00a0 \", \"Alex Spiro: There's a critical window here where \\u2014 Don Lewis went missing. Where the rubber meets the road is what happened during those 24 hours.\", \"So, what happened the during those 24 hours? Carole says she last saw Don Lewis early in the morning of August 18, 1997, when she came home from running a late-night errand.\\u00a0\", \"Leonora LePeter Anton:\\u00a0 She wouldn't talk to us in person this time.

There was a bobcat kitten and two caracal kittens.

She says her car broke down. Carole says she walked all the way home. It took her until nearly 4 a.m.\", \"Leonora LaPeter\\u00a0Anton: And then when she got home, Don wanted to immediately go back and get the car. So, at 4 in the morning, they went back.

After Don disappeared, Carole produced what she said was Don's will and power of attorney leaving her in charge of everything.
