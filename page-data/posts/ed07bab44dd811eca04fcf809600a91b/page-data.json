The virus uses this protein to enter human cells.\", \"Peacock wrote: \\\"Worth emphasising this is at super low numbers right now in a region of Africa that is fairly well sampled, however it very very much should be monitored due to that horrific spike profile (would take a guess that this would be worse antigenically than nearly anything else about).\\\"\", \"While data is currently lacking, some scientists have speculated about what sort of advantages the virus might have over other variants based on what we know about its mutations.\", \"Ravi Gupta, professor of clinical microbiology at the Cambridge Institute for Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Diseases, has said the variant may be able to resist immunity.\", \"He wrote on Twitter on Wednesday: \\\"This one is worrying and I've not said that since Delta.\", \"\\\"Please get vaccinated and boosted and mask up in public as the mutations in this virus likely result in high level escape from neutralising antibodies.\\\"\", \"A COVID variant that resists immunity may be more able to dodge the immune system of people who have either caught the virus once already or been vaccinated against it.\", \"Greg Dore, an infectious disease physician at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, Australia, tweeted on Wednesday night that B.1.1.529 \\\"has mutations associated [with] reduced vaccine effectiveness\\\" but added it may also be that case that the variant is not particularly transmissible.\", \"He added: \\\"Time to monitor, not time to panic.\\\"\", \"B.1.1.529 was added to the World Health Organization's list of variants under monitoring on Wednesday.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1940094/covid-test.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A stock photo shows a health worker testing someone for COVID.
