Panic spreads in an instant even if, as with the Omicron variant, the extent of the threat is not yet known. Vaccines look like deliverance until they seem a little less than that. National responses diverge with no discernible logic. Anxiety and depression spread. So do loneliness and screen fatigue. The feeling grows that the Covid era will go on for years, like plagues of old.\", \"Even in China, with no reported Covid deaths since January, some confess weariness with the measures that have kept them safe when so many others perished.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m so tired of all these routines,\\u201d Chen Jun, 29, a tech company worker in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, said the other day. He was forced to take three Covid-19 tests in June following an outbreak in the city, and then had to quarantine for 14 days. Thumbtacks he used to pin on a world map to trace his travels have stopped multiplying. \\u201cI\\u2019m starting to think we\\u2019ll never see an end to the pandemic.\\u201d\", \"This sense of endlessness, accompanied by growing psychological distress leading to depression, was a recurrent theme in two dozen interviews conducted in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas. After two years of zigzagging policy and roller coaster emotions, terrible loss and tantalizing false dawns, closing borders and intermittently shuttered schools, people\\u2019s resilience has dwindled.\", \"That is sure to pose new challenges for leaders trying to protect their people and their economies. Will the weary obey new restrictions, or risk seeing family and friends after months of forced separation? The question of just how draconian leaders can be when people\\u2019s mental health has become so fragile appears to be a core dilemma as the pandemic enters its third year.\", \"\\u201cI know it will only get worse, it won\\u2019t stop, the pandemic will only turn more life-consuming,\\u201d said Natalia Shishkova, a teacher in Moscow. \\u201cIt is all chaos, like a fantasy film. You watch all these apocalypse films and realize their writers were real prophets.\\u201d\", \"Real progress in fighting the virus has been made. A year ago, vaccine rollouts were in their infancy. Today, about 47 percent of the world\\u2019s population is inoculated. If case numbers remain high, death rates have plunged. Yet life seems out of control.\", \"The pandemic not only makes this month\\u2019s vacation or holiday celebrations seem uncertain, but also sometimes overwhelms understanding. How to assess the avalanche of statistics, opinions, warnings, closures, reopenings? What to make of the big business Covid-19 has become, with its vested interests? What to do about the glaring inequality in vaccine distribution? How to avert one\\u2019s gaze from the discarded masks that still dot streets, the pandemic\\u2019s perennial detritus?\", \"Once linear, life now seems circular. Schools open. They close again. Travel becomes easier, only for new obstacles to arise. Sickness from Covid-19 subsides, to be replaced by long Covid and now indications that even those who have recovered from the virus might get reinfected with Omicron. At the Paris laboratory of Maria Melchior, a French epidemiologist who specializes in mental illness, in-person meetings had just been reinstated when, this week, she was told they would cease, with a return to Zoom gatherings.\", \"\\u201cWe no longer know when we will get back to normal,\\u201d Ms. Melchior said. And what is normal now? She paused. \\u201cWell, at least a life without masks.\\u201d\", \"In Kenya, with infections declining in October, President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted a longstanding curfew. Bars filled. Musicians lined up concert dates, as they have in many parts of the world, where theaters and opera houses have also reopened. Spirits rose.\", \"Then, the Omicron variant hit. Even before any cases were reported there, Kenya\\u2019s leaders announced plans to bar unvaccinated people from offices and warned of new holiday-season restrictions.\", \"Corrie Mwende, a communications specialist in Nairobi, said she had felt like \\u201cfreedom was coming back\\u201d after a long period when \\u201cyou could say it was like the end of the world.\\u201d\", \"Today she is unsure her hope will be fulfilled.\", \"Such hesitation is pervasive. The pandemic began with evasiveness from the great powers of the 21st century, first President Xi Jinping\\u2019s China and then President Donald J. Trump\\u2019s America. Trust was dented, time lost. Ever since, a cohesive global response has appeared elusive.\", \"China has pursued a zero Covid policy, virtually shutting its borders and deploying mass-testing, snap lockdowns and high-tech contact tracing. At the other extreme, Russia, despite a high rate of deaths, has done little to restrict movement.\", \"The 27-nation European Union is split over whether to make vaccines obligatory, and policies vary widely: soccer stadiums are empty again in Germany, where infection rates have surged, but full in France, where they have, too, but a presidential election looms in four months.\", \"Britain, under Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has veered between herd immunity temptations and the kind of periodic restrictions now in force again to combat the Omicron variant.\", \"In Brazil, whose president, Jair Bolsonaro, has persistently minimized the pandemic\\u2019s threat, the death toll has plunged to fewer than 300 a day from 3,000 in April. Samba concerts are back in the streets. Fireworks, after some back-and-forth, will light the sky over Copacabana beach to mark the New Year \\u2014 unless some new disaster strikes.\", \"Maybe that will be Omicron; maybe not. Some other variants have come and gone without driving the pandemic to terrifying new heights.\", \"For now, every plan is a provisional plan.\", \"Conspiracy theories abound, in part because the pandemic has enriched the wealthy as markets have soared, and punished those without investments. \", \"Yakov Kochetkov, head of the Center for Cognitive Therapy in Moscow, said, \\u201cIn Russia there has been a strong increase in mistrust of vaccines, even the term \\u2018pandemic\\u2019 itself. This greatly affects the psyche.\\u201d\", \"Just this month, a 45-year-old man reported to view the pandemic as a conspiracy opened fire at a Russian government office and killed two people after being told to put on a mask.\", \"Anna Shepel, a Russian therapist, has observed her patients\\u2019 \\u201cobsessive thoughts, obsessive actions, fear of getting infected, fear of touching anything in public places.\\u201d\", \"Nevertheless, in a country with a deep vein of fatalism and stoicism, President Vladimir V. Putin has faced little criticism for his relatively lax response to the coronavirus.\", \"In Italy, hit to devastating effect early in the pandemic, access to everything from movie theaters to offices has been strictly curtailed for anyone who does not have the \\u201cgreen pass\\u201d of the vaccinated. The government is promising a \\u201csemi-normal\\u201d Christmas without the need to resort to lockdowns. Still, the mood of the country is somber.\", \"Massimiliano Valerii, the director general of CENSIS, a Rome-based research group, observed that the pandemic had exacerbated anxieties about the future. \\u201cThe social ladder has been blocked, the mechanism for being able to improve one\\u2019s position in life,\\u201d he said.\", \"David Lazzari, the president of Italy\\u2019s psychologists\\u2019 guild, said recent studies in Italy showed the incidence of anxiety and depression had doubled since the pandemic began. For those under 18, levels had reached 25 percent. \\u201cOne in four,\\u201d he noted. \\u201cThat\\u2019s very high.\\u201d\", \"Among adolescents and young adults \\u2014 stuck on their screens, often unable to date over the past two years, inundated with online friends but short of actual contact \\u2014 anorexia and bulimia have spread, said Ms. Melchior, the French epidemiologist who focuses on mental illness.\", \"In France, she added, depression and anxiety are at about twice normal levels, in line with the Italian findings and a recent report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\", \"The surgeon general in the United States warned recently that young people are facing \\u201cdevastating\\u201d mental health effects as a result of the pandemic and other challenges experienced by their generation.\", \"Chanel Contos, 23, an Australian student in London who is uncertain whether she will be able to fly home this month, expressed acute frustration at having been told that \\u201conce we had adequate vaccines in the country you\\u2019re in, things would be OK.\\u201d\", \"She asked a question frequently heard among her generation: \\u201cHow much of our lives can we give up for this?\\u201d\", \"Governments are acutely aware of this frustration. Nicolas Franck, a French psychiatrist, said, \\u201cWe fell short initially, now we are in the phase of excess precaution.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cPeople are so exhausted their greatest fear is not so much a new variant but a new curfew,\\u201d he added.\", \"China, through its extreme measures, has been determined to move on. But a sense of normalcy remains elusive, and the second anniversary of the day the first reported patient experienced symptoms in Wuhan did not pass without comment.\", \"Hundreds of people posted messages on the social media account of Li Wenliang, a doctor in Wuhan who many consider a martyr for the official threats he received over his online attempts to warn friends \\u2014 and by extension the world \\u2014 of a strange new disease ravaging his hospital.\", \"\\u201cI can\\u2019t believe that we have been wearing masks now for two years,\\u201d one commenter wrote.
