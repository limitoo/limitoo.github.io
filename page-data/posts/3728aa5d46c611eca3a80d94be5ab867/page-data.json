Eruptions of extremist violence \\u2014 including the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 and the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection \\u2014 have made militant groups like the Proud Boys and conspiracy theories like QAnon into household names. On his popular cable news show, Tucker Carlson recently name-checked the \\u201cgreat replacement\\u201d conspiracy theory. And in a recent survey, nearly a third of Republicans agreed with the statement that \\u201ctrue American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.\\u201d\", \"[You can listen to this episode of \\u201cThe Ezra Klein Show\\u201d on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]\", \"The historian Kathleen Belew has spent her career studying political violence and the once-fringe ideas that now animate even right-of-center politics and news media. She is a co-editor of \\u201cA Field Guide to White Supremacy\\u201d and the author of \\u201cBring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America,\\u201d which tells the story of how groups \\u2014 including the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and Aryan Nations \\u2014 coalesced into a radical white-power movement after the Vietnam War. These groups were united by a core set of beliefs about the threats of demographic change and governmental overreach, perceived hostility toward white Americans and the necessity of extra-political, often violent, action to achieve their aims.\", \"This is a conversation about how some of those ideas have seeped into mainstream Republican politics and what that could mean for the future of the party \\u2014 and the country. It explores the radicalizing effects of Jan. 6, how irony and meme culture import far-right ideas into popular media, how warfare abroad can produce violence at home, why politics has started to feel apocalyptic across the spectrum, whether left-wing violence is as serious a threat as right-wing violence and more.\", \"You can listen to the whole conversation by following \\u201cThe Ezra Klein Show\\u201d on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.
