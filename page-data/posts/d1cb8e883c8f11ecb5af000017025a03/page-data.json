Commissioner Gary Bettman on Monday defended the league\\u2019s response to a sexual assault accusation against a former coach.\", \"Kyle Beach, a career minor leaguer now playing in Germany, has said that he was sexually assaulted in 2010 by Brad Aldrich, then a Chicago Blackhawks video coach. An independent investigation commissioned this year by the team found that officials had not reported the accusation against Aldrich to the league or to law enforcement because they did not want a distraction during the team\\u2019s playoff run.\", \"Aldrich resigned from the team following that season, but only after Chicago won the Stanley Cup and after he had made a sexual advance toward an intern at the celebration, the investigative report, which was released Tuesday, said. Aldrich received a playoff bonus, and his name was engraved on the Cup.\", \"He later held several other jobs in hockey and pleaded guilty to sexual contact with a minor while he was a high school coach in Michigan, where he is a registered sex offender.\", \"\\u201cIt is clear that what happened was inappropriate and wrong on every level and was not handled correctly by the Blackhawks organization,\\u201d Bettman said in a conference call with reporters. \\u201cThis certainly has been a disturbing week for all of us.\\u201d\", \"Of Beach, who met with the commissioner on Saturday, Bettman said, \\u201cI am sorry for what he has been through, and thought he has been courageous, especially the past week.\\u201d\", \"The league has been criticized as being slow to respond to Beach\\u2019s accusation. \\u201cUntil last Monday, we had not seen the report in any form,\\u201d Bettman said.\", \"Joel Quenneville, who was the head coach of the Blackhawks in 2010, resigned as the Florida Panthers\\u2019 coach on Thursday, but was permitted to lead the team in a game on Wednesday, the day after details of the accusation emerged.\", \"Defending that decision, Bettman said: \\u201cHe had already coached 800 games since 2010, and I wanted to make sure that no one could say I prejudged him. People can disagree.\\u201d As a matter of due process, Bettman said, \\u201cI needed to meet him in person.\\u201d\", \"Kevin Cheveldayoff, who was an assistant general manager for the Blackhawks in 2010 and has said he attended a meeting about the accusation then, is now the Winnipeg Jets\\u2019 general manager. He was not punished by the league.\", \"Cheveldayoff \\u201cwas such a minor player in this,\\u201d Bettman said. \\u201cBecause of his limited authority and circumstance, he left the meeting\\u201d in 2010 thinking the matter would be investigated by higher-ups.\", \"\\u201cHe believed the matter had been appropriately taken care of\\u201d because of Aldrich\\u2019s eventual departure from the club, Bettman said.\", \"After the release of the investigation report last week, the N.H.L. fined the Blackhawks $2 million for what it called their \\u201cinsufficient and untimely response.\\u201d Some fans and journalists have pointed out that the penalty was $1 million less than the league initially fined the Devils in 2010 for circumventing the salary cap. Bettman contended that the fine against Chicago was \\u201csubstantial.\\u201d\", \"Stan Bowman, the Blackhawks\\u2019 president of hockey operations, and Al MacIsaac, the senior director of hockey administration, resigned last week in the aftermath of the report. Bowman also resigned as the general manager of the 2022 United States Olympic men\\u2019s ice hockey team.\", \"Bettman said Monday that he would have to review any request to return to the league from any of the people who left in connection with the matter.\", \"Beach\\u2019s accusation, although not his identity, was first made public in May in a lawsuit filed against the Blackhawks. That lawsuit has yet to be resolved. Aldrich claimed that any sexual encounter had been consensual, but Beach said Aldrich had threatened violence, as well as damage to his hockey career, if he didn\\u2019t comply.\", \"Beach, Chicago\\u2019s first-round draft pick in 2008, was with the team in 2010 as what is known as a \\u201cblack ace,\\u201d a minor leaguer who travels with the team during the playoffs in case he is needed because of an injury or a suspension.\", \"The N.H.L. Players\\u2019 Association has also received scrutiny, including from Beach, for its handling of the accusation. During a call on Monday with player representatives who make up the union\\u2019s executive board, Donald Fehr, the executive director of the players\\u2019 union, \\u201crecommended that an independent investigation be commenced by outside legal counsel\\u201d to review the union\\u2019s response, Jonathan Weatherdon, an N.H.L.P.A. spokesman, said in a statement.\", \"The executive board will vote on commissioning an investigation, the statement said. Fehr, a former chief of the Major League Baseball players\\u2019 union, began his role with the N.H.L.\\u2019s union in December 2010.\", \"The investigative report commissioned by the Blackhawks was released at a time when the league and the sport in general have been under the microscope because of other incidents of abuse, misogyny and racism. Players in a Canadian amateur league have filed a lawsuit saying they were sexually and physically assaulted as a part of hazing. A former minor league coach said he had been fired by the Pittsburgh Penguins after he reported that his wife had been sexually assaulted by one of his bosses. Misogynistic online messages by top N.H.L. players and an accusation of a racial slur used by a coach have also come to light.\", \"\\u201cThe N.H.L. has made considerable progress from where it was a decade ago,\\u201d Bettman said. \\u201cIf you listen to what N.H.L. personnel, especially the players, have been saying this week, you know things have been changing.\", \"\\u201cI believe most of our personnel are good people who do the right thing.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"d1cb8e883c8f11ecb5af000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d1cb8e883c8f11ecb5af000017025a03"}},
