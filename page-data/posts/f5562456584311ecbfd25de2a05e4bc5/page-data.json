The two allegedly broke into Phillips' Springdale, Arkansas home after a teenage girl reportedly told them Phillips sexually abused her when she was younger, a claim that police said allegedly made them enraged.\", \"The girl was reportedly at a party with all three men when she told Baker what allegedly happened, according to court records. Baker reportedly became angry, grabbed a knife from the kitchen and claimed he wanted to kill Phillips, but the girl was able to calm Baker down and he reportedly promised not to hurt Phillips, the report said.\", \"However, according to the report, on November 23, about a month after the party, Baker, who is the ex-boyfriend of Phillips' wife, and Blanks allegedly broke into Phillips' home and beat him unconscious before dragging his body out of the apartment.

Blanks' truck was parked nearby and matched the one seen on security footage from the victim's apartment.
