They believe Theesfeld lured Ally into his truck.\", \"Ben Creekmore: \\u2026 under the guise of working the relationship out when he had a .40-caliber pistol and had planned her murder all along.\", \"Theesfeld's attorney says that theory might be tough to prove at trial.\", \"Tony Farese: They were going to have to show that we kidnapped Ally. She voluntarily gets in the truck. They're going to try and say that we tricked her \\u2026 that's a very big stretch.\", \"With Theesfeld facing a possible death sentence, and prosecutors knowing a capital murder trial could be grueling, emotional, and risky for everyone involved, they presented the defense with an offer.\", \"Tony Farese: If you get a plea other than death, then guess what? You've got a scenario where a plea to a lesser charge of first-degree murder is certainly more attractive.\", \"And that's exactly what happened. On August 27, 2021, Brandon Theesfeld, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. Ally's family and friends were there wearing her favorite color, pink.\", \"The judge sentenced Brandon to life in prison. Reporter Jake Thompson was in the courtroom.\", \"Jake Thompson: We never saw emotion from him until the plea hearing when he spoke or read a little bit \\u2026 he broke down in tears \\u2026 that was the first time he showed emotion.\", \"Theesfeld's audio was muffled when he faced the judge and addressed the court. He said in part: \", \"\\\"There is no excuse for my actions. I have asked God for forgiveness, and I hope one day that you will find it in your hearts to forgive me.\\\"\", \"Tony Farese: Brandon Theesfeld stood up and accepted responsibility in open court. \\u2026 And the realization of the consequences of his actions are very real and sobering \\u2026 there's no parole for murder in Mississippi, so let me tell you that is a terrible penalty.\", \"Michelle Miller: Why did he say he killed her?\", \"Tony Farese: There's no justification for his conduct. And I believe no good explanation for what he did.\", \"Michelle Miller: Does he say why, though?\", \"Tony Farese: No, I'm just telling you to the best of, I mean there's no good answer. \\u2026 I think what has been explained is he is impaired on alcohol, he's drunk. \\u2026 he's impaired on cocaine. We certainly know what that does to someone's mind \\u2026 so, you know, was he justified? Absolutely not. \\u2026 Were they arguing? Not to my knowledge. \\u2026 did the allegation of pregnancy going on and on and on contribute to that? Certainly, could have.\", \"Tony Farese: He shared with us that he didn't, he didn't know, but he didn't believe that she were pregnant.\", \"Michelle Miller: Oh, he said he didn't believe she \\u2013 \", \"Tony Farese: He doubted that she was \\u2013\", \"Michelle Miller: He doubted that she was pregnant.\", \"Tony Farese: He doubted that she was pregnant.\", \"Prosecutors say the home pregnancy tests results were inconclusive. Ally's autopsy report, however, was definitive.\", \"Mickey Mallette: We know medically she was not pregnant.\", \"Could Ally have been pregnant in the months leading up to her death? According to a text message she sent Theesfeld in early July, Ally says she had been bleeding and believed something was wrong.\", \"Mickey Mallette: There was \\u2026 some evidence that would have, that could indicate she had a miscarriage.\", \"Michelle Miller: Do you believe she was pregnant?\", \"Cindy Kostial: I do. At some point I do.\", \"Michelle Miller: To your knowledge, was she pregnant?\", \"Morgan Hull: We just don't know. She could have been, but also the results were inconclusive, so we really just aren't sure.\", \"Prosecutors believe what happened between Ally Kostial and Brandon Theesfeld is a cautionary tale.\", \"Ben Creekmore: I can't imagine how there could be any way possible that Ally could have known that Brandon Theesfeld was capable of doing what he did to her. If she had any idea that this is what this person was capable of, she would never had gotten in that truck \\u2026 I think love can blind us to certain things that other people can see that we can't.\", \"Brandon Theesfeld's family chose not to participate in our broadcast. His mother asked his attorney to share these words:\", \"Tony Farese (reading email):\\u00a0\", \"\\u2026 when I heard Brandon was being spoken to by the police, I still had no single thought it could be him \\u2026 now, after two years and knowing more of the details of their relationship I am heartbroken for every person this impacts and crushed that our son did not share with us any of the turmoil he was trying to manage \\u2026 I encourage every parent to regularly sit down with their children, teenagers, young adults, and discuss with them that there will never be anything too big, too complicated, too out of control that they cannot tell you about.
