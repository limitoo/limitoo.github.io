The category means that China Evergrande had formally defaulted but had not yet entered into any kind of bankruptcy filing, liquidation or other process that would stop its operations.\", \"The announcement came after the expiration on Monday of a deadline for Evergrande to make payments on two of its bonds, worth more than a combined $82 million. Evergrande said nothing after the deadline expired, but some bondholders said they had not received their payments.\", \"Evergrande did not respond to a request for comment. Fitch said the company had not responded to its own request for confirmation about the bond payments it missed.\", \"The next steps were not immediately clear. Evergrande has already said it would \\u201cactively engage\\u201d with its foreign creditors to come up with a plan for restructuring \\u2014 an often long and drawn-out process that can involve stripping a company down and selling off its parts to pay everyone off.\", \"But any move would require the blessing of the Chinese government, which worries that a sudden unwinding of the company could hit the country\\u2019s financial system or potentially the many homeowners in China who have already paid for apartments that are yet to be built.\", \"Earlier this week, Evergrande said officials from several state-backed institutions had joined a risk committee that would help the company restructure itself.\", \"While Fitch\\u2019s designation has made Evergrande\\u2019s default official, the market had long anticipated this moment. For months, Evergrande has struggled to meet deadlines on bond payments. For many, it was only a matter of time before the company ran out of cash to pay its bills.\", \"\\u201cWe all expected that Evergrande was not going to be able to pull a rabbit out of their hat,\\u201d said Michel L\\u00f6wy, chief executive of SC Lowy, an investment firm that has a small position in Evergrande bonds.\", \"\\u201cNow, the ball is in their court to come up with some form of restructuring proposal,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"b9431c4b58d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b9431c4b58d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}},
