Japan and France reported their first Omicron cases Tuesday, joining the U.K., Germany, Australia and others that have seen the variant slip past their borders.\", \"Some nations looking to curb new outbreaks in the lingering pandemic have rapidly enacted travel restrictions, especially for visitors coming from South Africa, AP reported. South Africa and the WHO have urged against the measures, while the discovery of earlier Omicron infections in the Netherlands casts doubt on how effective such restrictions might be when the variant's origin remains unclear.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942342/schiphol-airport.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Netherlands\\u2019 RIVM health institute discovered the Omicron coronavirus variant in samples from as early as November 19, five days before the World Health Organization said that South Africa first reported the mutated strain.

Others sent more reassuring messages, like European Medicines Agency chief Emer Cooke, who insisted that the 27-nation European Union was well prepared for the variant. While it is not known how effective current vaccines are against Omicron, Cooke said the shots could be adapted within three or four months if need be.\", \"But nearly two years after the virus first held the world in its grip, the current response echoed in many ways the chaos of the early days, including haphazard travel bans and a poor understanding of who was at risk and where.\", \"Many officials tried to calm fears, insisting vaccines remain the best defense and that the world must redouble its efforts to get the shots to every part of the globe.\", \"The latest variant makes those efforts even more important, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, noting as many have before that \\\"as long as the virus is replicating somewhere, it could be mutating.\\\"\", \"In the face of the new variant, some introduced new measures aimed at mitigating the spread.\", \"England made face coverings mandatory again on public transport and in shops, banks and hairdressers.
