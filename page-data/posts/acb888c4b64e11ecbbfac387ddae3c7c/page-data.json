Almost four out of five students reported shivering inside their home\", \"The results were worse for M\\u0101ori students and those with disabilities or long-term health concerns who were even more likely to have visible mould in their homes.\", \"Wellington student Jaime Shorter said mould at home had caused her asthma to flare up.\", \"\\\"The mould on the curtains actually made me quite wheezy at night. I actually struggled to sleep for the first couple of weeks until I got used to it and started taking Antihistamines before bed,\\\" she said.\", \"Student Duncan Macintyre said a Manners Street flat he moved into last year looked fine at the start of the year before mould started growing in June.\", \"\\\"All the corners of the rooms were just extremely mouldy. We had black mould in a couple of the bedrooms and then the toilets were the same. One of my mates got quite sick from it,\\\" he said.\", \"Macintyre said he and his flatmates were often worried about their health but there was little they could do.\", \"\\\"It was almost scary because we knew it was there, we had talked to the landlord about getting it removed but there was no way of actually getting rid of it,\\\" he said.\", \"Kaito Ibaraki said a mouldy flat, with most on his bedroom ceiling, impacted his mental health.\", \"\\\"It's pretty depressing. I feel like your house looking like that and it kind of being out of your hands can have a mental impact,\\\" Ibaraki said.\", \"Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association estimates the vast majority of students live in houses with some mould.\", \"The Property Investor's Federation said a lot of landlords were doing their bit.\", \"\\\"Landlords are doing as much as they can and trying to bring their houses up to the Healthy Homes Standards.

One student was admitted to hospital with a chest infection, and another said their child had been hospitalised with pneumonia,\\\" O'Sullivan said.\", \"Students reported their mental health was also suffering.

Instead, students reported using course-related costs to help pay for their electricity bills with one saying that had increased their student loan debt by $1000.\", \"Dr O'Sullivan said while new healthy homes standards introduced to improve the energy efficiency of private rentals would help, it's clear more targeted support is needed.\"]","href_hash":"acb888c4b64e11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"acb888c4b64e11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
