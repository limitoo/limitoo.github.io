The jurors whose names were publicized for the first time either declined to comment on Monday or could not be reached.\", \"\\u201cMost of them really just want to stay low-key and stay behind the scenes,\\u201d Brandon Mitchell, a juror who spoke publicly about a week after the verdict on April 20, said on Monday. He said that all of the jurors have been keeping in touch on an email chain since the trial. \\u201cThey\\u2019re scared of the unknown and of becoming a public figure instead of spending their lives in peace.\\u201d\", \"At the home of one juror, less than two miles from where Mr. Chauvin knelt on Mr. Floyd\\u2019s neck, a sign was taped to the door that said \\u201cPlease, no press no soliciting.\\u201d A Black Lives Matter poster was displayed prominently in a window of the home.\", \"In interviews since the trial, Mr. Mitchell and several other jurors have recounted how they gathered in a hotel conference room and pored over the case for two days of deliberations, making lists and timelines on a whiteboard and reviewing videos and testimony. Accounts have differed on how many people leaned toward voting guilty right away; Mr. Mitchell has said that 11 jurors were initially ready to convict on a murder charge and one was unsure, while another juror said last week that as many as five had initially been unsure.\", \"In an interview with several jurors that aired on CNN last week, one said she had been swayed by the fact that Mr. Chauvin had not provided aid to Mr. Floyd as he pinned him to the ground with his knee for nine minutes and 29 seconds.\", \"\\u201cThis is not what he did, but more or less what he didn\\u2019t do,\\u201d the juror, Jodi Doud, said on CNN. \\u201cHe did not provide lifesaving measures for George Floyd when he knew that the guy was in pain or needed medical attention.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Chauvin and several other officers who have been charged in Mr. Floyd\\u2019s death responded on May 25, 2020, to a 911 call from a convenience store clerk who said Mr. Floyd had used a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Officers took Mr. Floyd to the ground and handcuffed him, and Mr. Chauvin knelt on his neck as a group of bystanders formed on the sidewalk. Several of the bystanders yelled for officers to get off Mr. Floyd, and one, Darnella Frazier, took a cellphone video of the scene that sparked outrage and led to protests across the world.\", \"After the jury\\u2019s verdict, Judge Peter A. Cahill sentenced Mr. Chauvin to 22 and a half years in prison.\", \"The court on Monday also released responses to questionnaires that were sent to hundreds of prospective jurors before lawyers for both sides whittled down the pool to 12 jurors, as well as two alternate jurors who sat through the trial but did not deliberate or vote on the verdict.\", \"The questionnaires reveal a diverse range of opinions from the jurors, who were from throughout Hennepin County and ranged in age from their 20s to their 60s. Four of the jurors were Black, six were white and two were multiracial; seven of the 12 were women.\", \"In the questionnaires, they were asked about their views on everything from the Black Lives Matter movement to podcasts to how they viewed their own interactions with the police. Some checked a box indicating that they had been \\u201cvery satisfied\\u201d when they had called the police for help, while another said she was \\u201cvery unsatisfied\\u201d after asking the police for help when her purse was stolen from a bar.\", \"Some said they regularly read or watched the news while others said they had little interest. \\u201cI don\\u2019t really follow the news or politics,\\u201d wrote one juror, Journee Howard, who said she listened to Joe Rogan\\u2019s podcast and came across news snippets on Facebook but otherwise did not seek them out.\", \"Still, all of the jurors were able to describe many facts of Mr. Floyd\\u2019s death and the demonstrations that rocked the city in the days after, a sign of just how much the killing affected the region. All but one of the jurors said they had seen at least part of the video that showed Mr. Chauvin kneeling on Mr. Floyd\\u2019s neck.\", \"Asked whether they believed that the police treated white and Black people equally, almost all disagreed, while all jurors said they agreed with the statement that \\u201cPolice in my community make me feel safe.\\u201d They diverged more on how they viewed the phrases \\u201cBlack lives matter\\u201d and \\u201cblue lives matter\\u201d and on whether the demonstrations that followed Mr. Floyd\\u2019s death \\u2014 which were particularly destructive in Minneapolis \\u2014 had helped or hurt the city.\", \"Asked if they wanted to serve on the jury, five indicated that they wanted to be selected as jurors and six checked a box that said \\u201cNot sure.\\u201d One woman checked both \\u201cYes\\u201d and \\u201cNot sure.\\u201d\", \"In the CNN interview, several jurors pushed back on critics who have suggested that they must have felt pressure to convict because of the protests in Minneapolis after Mr. Floyd\\u2019s death and the protests that followed the fatal police shooting of another Black man in a Minneapolis suburb during the trial.\", \"\\u201cThis was no easy task for us,\\u201d one of the jurors, Sherri Hardeman, said in the CNN interview. \\u201cI felt like it was my civic duty to step forward and represent, and a lot of people have different opinions about the verdict and about the whole process, but it wasn\\u2019t an easy task; we took this very seriously.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"05d7fa063b6211ecb27f000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"05d7fa063b6211ecb27f000017025a03"}},
