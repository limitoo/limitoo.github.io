And Mr. Bolsonaro\\u2019s absence from the summit raised questions about his commitment to the reversal.\", \"Days before the conference, Brazil\\u2019s government announced a policy to create green jobs while preserving the country\\u2019s vast forests. Then, on Monday, Brazil committed to cutting carbon emissions in half by 2030, achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and ending illegal deforestation by 2028.\", \"Yet environmentalists and political opponents in Brazil were quick to poke holes in the announcements. The green growth plan lacked details to make it credible, they said, and the commitment on emissions is essentially unchanged from the one Brazil made in 2015.\", \"Then there is Brazil\\u2019s track record. By law, the country was supposed to have already started slashing its emissions. Instead, Brazil is one of the few nations where emissions rose during the pandemic, an increase that was largely driven by a surge in deforestation.\", \"From August 2020 to July 2021, Brazil\\u2019s portion of the Amazon lost 4,200 square miles of tree cover, according to the latest numbers published by the National Institute of Space Research.\"]","href_hash":"4e22ccf03cb111ec94e4000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4e22ccf03cb111ec94e4000017025a03"}},
