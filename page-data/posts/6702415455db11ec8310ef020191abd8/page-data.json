The Indian Army said that the soldiers had been responding to \\u201ccredible intelligence\\u201d reports about the movement of insurgents, who often cross into Myanmar after attacking soldiers.\", \"News about the killings spread quickly on social media and prompted residents in the area to attack troops and set two military vehicles on fire.
