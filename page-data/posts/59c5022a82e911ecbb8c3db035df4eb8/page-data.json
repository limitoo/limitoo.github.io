Barrack Jr., who is charged with illegally lobbying then-President Donald J. Trump, suggested that the delay in his prosecution was politically motivated.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-01-31T15:00:41.000Z","content":"[\"Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a real-estate investor and close friend of former President Donald J. Trump, asked a federal judge to dismiss the foreign lobbying and obstruction of justice charges against him on Monday, contending that the Justice Department delayed prosecuting him until after Mr. Trump left office.\", \"The argument, laid out in a court filing, marks Mr. Barrack\\u2019s first substantive response to an indictment unsealed last July in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, which accused him of using his access to Mr. Trump to advance the foreign policy aims of the United Arab Emirates and then misleading federal agents about his activities.\", \"Mr. Barrack, 74, was arrested on July 20 in Los Angeles. He pleaded not guilty and was freed on a $250 million bond, over objections from federal prosecutors who argued he was a flight risk.\", \"He is set to go to trial in September alongside his business associate, Matthew Grimes, who was charged in the same indictment but only with the lobbying counts. Prosecutors also charged Rashid al-Malik Alshahhi, an Emirati businessman who left the country after federal agents interviewed him in 2018 and who remains at large.\", \"In addition to raising \\u201cthe specter that the government intentionally delayed bringing this case for political reasons or tactical advantage,\\u201d his lawyers also argued in their filing that the lobbying and obstruction charges against Mr. Barrack were not supported by facts.\", \"A spokesman for the U.S. attorney\\u2019s office in Brooklyn, which is bringing the case, declined to comment.\", \"The case against Mr. Barrack centers on his role as an informal adviser to Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 campaign. Prosecutors said Mr. Barrack, a financier with strong ties to the Middle East, used his influence to promote the Emirates\\u2019 agenda, while soliciting direction, feedback and talking points from senior Emirati officials.\", \"Once Mr. Trump was elected, they said, Mr. Barrack invited senior Emirati officials to give him a \\u201cwish list\\u201d of foreign policy moves they wanted Washington to take during Mr. Trump\\u2019s term, prosecutors said.\", \"In their court filing Monday, Mr. Barrack\\u2019s lawyers took issue with the lobbying and conspiracy charges against him, which contend that he failed to register with the U.S. attorney general\\u2019s office as an agent of the U.A.E. The indictment includes Mr. Barrack\\u2019s communications and public statements but, according to the court filing, \\u201cconspicuously omits any facts that he undertook these activities because he agreed to be directed or controlled by the U.A.E.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Barrack also objected to the five counts against him that relate to his communications with law enforcement. In June 2019 \\u2014 several months after F.B.I. agents served subpoenas on Mr. Barrack\\u2019s company and associates \\u2014 Mr. Barrack sat down with agents for a voluntary interview, during which, prosecutors say, he lied about his contacts and activities involving the Emiratis.\", \"Mr. Barrack\\u2019s lawyers said investigators did not record the interview but instead made handwritten notes that obscured Mr. Barrack\\u2019s statements.\", \"The indictment describes events that took place between 2016 and 2019. \\u201cWhy the government waited more than two years, and until after a change in administration, is a question only it can answer,\\u201d Mr. Barrack\\u2019s lawyers said.\", \"In his final days in office, Mr. Trump issued executive pardons and commutations to dozens of people, including supporters and former aides facing federal indictments and serving sentences for convicted crimes.\", \"The filing adds that the \\u201clengthy delay\\u201d has meant Mr. Barrack could not preserve evidence, including records of conversations with Trump administration officials.\", \"\\u201cSuch communications would disprove the government\\u2019s theory that Mr. Barrack acted as a secret agent of the U.A.E. to betray the United States and instead demonstrate his activities were undertaken with the knowledge of the Trump campaign and administration,\\u201d the filing says.\", \"His lawyers noted that Mr. Barrack, while seeking an official position with the Trump administration, submitted extensive information to the government about his overseas contacts, and that starting in late 2017 he voluntarily met with investigators for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, during the inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\", \"The inquiry by the U.S. attorney\\u2019s office in Brooklyn into Mr. Barrack\\u2019s ties with foreign leaders grew out of that investigation. After Mr. Barrack\\u2019s June 2019 meeting with the F.B.I., his lawyers said, he heard nothing from the government about the matter until two years later, when, they said, a dozen armed agents burst into a Los Angeles office where Mr. Barrack was attending a business meeting and took him into custody.\"]","href_hash":"59c5022a82e911ecbb8c3db035df4eb8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"59c5022a82e911ecbb8c3db035df4eb8"}},
