Among the most notable revisions: Marilyn Manson lost one nomination, and a little-known songwriter, Linda Chorney, was added to the competitors for best American roots song.\", \"Manson, the shock rocker who is being investigated by the authorities in Los Angeles on accusations of sexual assault (numerous women have come forward), had been nominated twice for his work with Kanye West, including in the album of the year category as a featured artist and a songwriter on West\\u2019s album \\u201cDonda,\\u201d and for best rap song, as one of the writers of West\\u2019s \\u201cJail.\\u201d\", \"Manson, whose real name \\u2014 and official songwriting credit \\u2014 is Brian Hugh Warner, has been removed from the rap song category; although Manson is credited as a writer on \\u201cJail, Pt 2,\\u201d another track from \\u201cDonda,\\u201d he is not listed among the writers on the most current version of the album.\", \"The addition of Chorney is more complex, and offers a partial if confusing glimpse into the Grammys\\u2019 behind-the-scenes process of tabulating votes.\", \"Chorney had been on an initial version of the ballot under best American roots song, for her \\u201cBored.\\u201d That version of the list, which circulated outside the Recording Academy in the days before the nominations were announced on Nov. 23, also had just eight slots for the top four categories; the day before that announcement, the Grammys\\u2019 board approved increasing that number to 10, adding artists including West and Taylor Swift. When the final nominations list came out, Chorney had been replaced by another artist, though some news outlets online still included her name.\", \"This week, the Grammys added Chorney back in. She had been removed, the academy said, because the accounting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the awards\\u2019 longtime partner in collecting and tabulating votes, had performed an \\u201caudit\\u201d on the votes she received, and the academy decided to remove her name from the ballot.\", \"\\u201cThat audit has now concluded, and Ms. Chorney\\u2019s recording has been added back in,\\u201d the academy said in a statement. \\u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience this delay may have caused, but ensuring the integrity of our voting process is paramount.\\u201d It offered no explanation for how the early nominations list, which contained Chorney\\u2019s name, was released.\", \"Why was the audit conducted? In an interview on Wednesday, Chorney said that Harvey Mason Jr., the academy\\u2019s chief executive, told her in a phone call this week that she had been \\u201cflagged\\u201d because of her previous public comments about the Grammys. In 2011, her \\u201cEmotional Jukebox\\u201d was a surprise nominee for best Americana album. She was criticized at the time for \\u201cgaming the system\\u201d \\u2014 she acknowledged using the Grammys\\u2019 website to promote herself, a common and permitted tactic at the time \\u2014 and said she even got death threats. She helped make a movie about the experience titled \\u201cWhen I Sing.\\u201d\", \"Days after this year\\u2019s nominations were announced, the Grammys came under scrutiny for giving nominations to figures like Manson and Louis C.K., the comedian who in 2017 admitted to sexual misconduct. In a recent interview with The Wrap, Mason said that Grammy eligibility is based only on the recordings submitted for the awards, not any artist\\u2019s past behavior. \\u201cWe won\\u2019t look back at people\\u2019s history,\\u201d he said.\", \"Chorney praised Mason for looking into the problem and addressing it quickly. When he called her, she said, \\u201cI was ecstatic. I felt validated.\\u201d\", \"The Grammys ceremony will be held on Jan. 31 in Los Angeles, hosted by Trevor Noah.\"]","href_hash":"ee4f1e8e539711ecb5c4db133823bdcb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ee4f1e8e539711ecb5c4db133823bdcb"}},
