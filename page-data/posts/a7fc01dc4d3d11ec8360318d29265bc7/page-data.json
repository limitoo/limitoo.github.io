Ariel Goldberg \\u2014 the protagonist of Veera Hiranandani\\u2019s accomplished new middle grade novel \\u2014 struggles with schoolwork and being the only Jewish girl in sixth grade. Her 18-year-old sister, Leah, is secretly dating a Hindu boy whose family emigrated from India; when Ari\\u2019s and Leah\\u2019s parents refuse to accept the relationship, Leah elopes with Raj and disappears. Now Ari must cope, alone, with her knowledge that her parents\\u2019 bakery is failing; her rift with her best friend, Jane; her Jew-hating classmate\\u2019s bullying; and her mother\\u2019s insistence that if she just worked harder she\\u2019d do better in school.\", \"There\\u2019s one bright spot. Unlike Ma, Ari\\u2019s new teacher, Miss Field, doesn\\u2019t think Ari is lazy. Miss Field figures out that Ari has something called dysgraphia and encourages her to write poetry on an IBM Selectric \\u2014 typing helps Ari\\u2019s hands keep up with her brain.\", \"Ari doesn\\u2019t understand how her parents can be so prejudiced against Raj when they themselves have faced bias and they admire the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ma chastises Raj, who speaks Hindi, Sindhi and some Urdu, but now mostly English, with, \\u201cVery impressive. I do think that if people are going to live here, they should learn our language.\\u201d Yet don\\u2019t she and Daddy speak Yiddish at home?\", \"When Ari tentatively confides her troubles to Jane (who it turns out has her own secrets and sorrows), the two plot a Nancy Drew-like trip to find Leah.\", \"\\u201cHow to Find What You\\u2019re Not Looking For\\u201d offers gentle humor and the perfect amount of \\u201970s-ness \\u2014 Jane\\u2019s drawing of the girls\\u2019 secret mission is \\u201creally swell\\u201d; Raj likes the Doors and Leah thinks the Beatles are groovier; Ari ponders giving two nickels to \\u201ca down-and-out fellow\\u201d on the subway. The book is written in the second person, and each chapter has a title starting with \\u201cHow to\\u201d \\u2014 \\u201cHow to Keep a Secret,\\u201d \\u201cHow to Write a Poem,\\u201d \\u201cHow to Follow the Rules,\\u201d \\u201cHow to Be a Mensch.\\u201d It works. The reader, like Ari, sees there\\u2019s no universal how-to for almost anything.\", \"What\\u2019s most striking about the book is how kind it is. People learn, forgive, try to do better. In a knee-jerk time (ours), it\\u2019s powerful to witness Ari\\u2019s realization that people can grow and change, that her parents\\u2019 prejudices are grounded in their own youthful traumas as well as historical Jewish trauma, that even her bully, who is definitely a jerk, has a story. (He\\u2019s scared and angry because his brother is off fighting in Vietnam.) None of this makes bullying or prejudice OK. But it makes it easier to call people in rather than out.\", \"Sometimes, though, expressions of rage are justified. \\u201cMaybe anger can be good or bad,\\u201d Ari observes, \\u201cdepending on what you do with it.\\u201d Sure, the book\\u2019s ending is a bit tidy; real life tends to be a lot thornier than the endings of middle grade novels.\", \"One might think a middle grade novel that addresses the landmark court case Loving v. Virginia, antisemitism, learning disabilities, the Vietnam War, the speeches of Martin Luther King Jr. and progressive education would seem overstuffed. But Hiranandani \\u2014 author of \\u201cThe Night Diary\\u201d (a Newbery honoree) and \\u201cThe Whole Story of Half a Girl\\u201d (a Sydney Taylor Notable Book) \\u2014 who herself is the daughter of an Ashkenazi white Jewish mother and a Hindu father, handles this dead-serious subject matter lightly, suffusing it with kindness and subtle comedy without being sappy or reductive. It\\u2019s a pretty astounding achievement.\"]","href_hash":"a7fc01dc4d3d11ec8360318d29265bc7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a7fc01dc4d3d11ec8360318d29265bc7"}},
