His promotion is effective immediately, and his first collection will be presented in February.\", \"Before he arrived at Bottega, Mr. Blazy, 37, spent three years at Calvin Klein designing men\\u2019s and women\\u2019s collections under Raf Simons, then its chief creative officer, who called Mr. Blazy a \\u201cgenius with people\\u201d and \\u201cready to lead.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s a great creative spirit,\\u201d Mr. Simons said. \\u201cHe comes with lots of ideas and willingness to experiment, and that is a source of great motivation for his team.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Blazy\\u2019s first job in fashion, years before he was at Calvin Klein, was also with Mr. Simons, as a designer for Mr. Simons\\u2019s namesake label. When Mr. Blazy left for Maison Martin Margiela, it was to expand his experience beyond men\\u2019s wear, Mr. Simons said.\", \"It was during his time at Margiela that Mr. Blazy first captured the attention of fashion media. In 2014, he was revealed as the designer of its Artisanal haute couture line \\u2014 the identities of these designers were typically kept secret \\u2014 and called, by The Cut, \\u201cthe most famous designer you\\u2019ve never heard of.\\u201d (Indeed, virtually no interviews with Mr. Blazy exist online even today.)\", \"The following year, The New York Times named him a contender for one of the next big jobs in fashion. At the time, he was a senior designer at Celine, where Mr. Lee also worked, and where Mr. Blazy had gone to learn more about the commercial side of the business, according to Mr. Simons.\", \"In a statement announcing the Bottega Veneta appointment on Monday, Fran\\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the chairman and chief executive of Bottega\\u2019s parent company, Kering, said that Mr. Blazy\\u2019s \\u201cwealth of experience and broad cultural background will allow him to bring his creative impetus to the task of carrying on the legacy of Bottega Veneta.\\u201d Mr. Blazy is a French and Belgian national who splits time between Antwerp and Milan.\", \"Leo Rongone, the chief executive of Bottega, said that \\u201cMatthieu\\u2019s appointment will further enhance the modern relevance of our brand and accelerate our growth, while preserving the values\\u201d core to the brand.\", \"That \\u201cmodern relevance\\u201d came largely thanks to Mr. Lee, who leaves his stamp on the brand with critically and commercially successful leather accessories, including square-toe shoes and pouch bags and new interpretations of the house\\u2019s signature \\u201cintrecciato\\u201d leather weave.\", \"Promoting from within, rather than recruiting a big-name designer from another big-name brand, is a strategy that has served Kering well, notably in 2015, when it filled the creative director role at Gucci with Alessandro Michele, then the head accessories designer.\", \"Robert Burke, the founder of a luxury consultancy firm in New York, called Mr. Blazy\\u2019s appointment \\u201cwell received in the industry\\u201d and said he didn\\u2019t expect any \\u201cslowing down\\u201d in the brand during this period of transition.\", \"\\u201cIt makes a lot of sense,\\u201d Mr. Burke said of Mr. Blazy\\u2019s new role. \\u201cHe clearly has already been immersed within the Bottega brand itself.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3c4573f8466511ec973d8f608b889097"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3c4573f8466511ec973d8f608b889097"}},
