Nathan agreed to have it done. But Mr. Epstein, who died by suicide more than two years ago, will not be so easily erased from the trial of Ms. Maxwell, his longtime partner.\", \"\\u201cThe shadow of Epstein is going to loom large here,\\u201d said Moira Penza, a former federal prosecutor in Brooklyn. \\u201cThe case is obviously going to be about Maxwell, but he\\u2019s going to be right at the center of it as well.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Maxwell, 59, the daughter of a British media mogul and a longtime fixture on New York\\u2019s social scene, had been linked to Mr. Epstein as a girlfriend and later helped him manage his homes and his social relationships.\", \"Her lawyers now face the challenge of trying to disentangle her from the allegations against Mr. Epstein \\u2014 even perhaps portraying her as his victim, legal experts said. But the government will also have to tread carefully before the jury.\", \"\\u201cThe prosecutors are certainly going to want to paint a picture of Epstein as an evil man, because that\\u2019s necessary for the jurors to understand and be outraged by her role in the scheme,\\u201d said Arlo Devlin-Brown, a former top federal corruption prosecutor in Manhattan.\", \"\\u201cBut they really have to walk a fine line,\\u201d he added, \\u201cbetween setting that stage and going overboard \\u2014 making the trial too much about Epstein and his conduct, and not enough about Maxwell.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Epstein, 66, was arrested on July 6, 2019, and charged with recruiting dozens of girls to engage in sex acts with him at his mansion in Manhattan and his estate in Palm Beach, Fla.

She had accused Mr. Epstein of raping her when she was a 15-year-old performing arts high school student in New York.\", \"The judge in Mr. Epstein\\u2019s case, Richard M.
