I've been snorkeling in a study to have a look at what's there and it's so seriously depleted,\\\" Handley said.\", \"\\\"Some stocks are so depleted that they might need re-seeding.\", \"\\\"Locals are being asked to keep an eye out themselves and to report anybody taking those four species, we would very much like government to resource this and to ensure there is some fisheries staff cover in our waters.\\\"\", \"Fisheries New Zealand director of fisheries management Emma Taylor said public consultation on the r\\u0101hui indicated that much of the public were supportive of the fisheries ban, and they hoped the r\\u0101hui would help the recovery of the wider ecosystem.\", \"\\\"We received 244 submissions with the majority supporting a closure. Closing these fisheries will help these important fisheries recover and support the health of the wider ecosystem,\\\" Taylor said.\", \"\\\"The feedback from tangata whenua and the public highlights concerns around the long-term sustainability of these four important fish species. Closing these fisheries is just one part of the solution.\", \"\\\"It's great to be able to support iwi by ensuring the closure is respected through regular patrols by MPI Fishery Officers.\\\"\", \"The r\\u0101hui applies to the whole surrounding inshore area of Waiheke Island out to one nautical mile and will cover customary, commercial, and recreational fishing.\", \"Ng\\u0101ti P\\u0101oa were looking forward to harnessing a m\\u0101tauranga M\\u0101ori approach towards protecting the t\\u012bkapa moana area and collaborating with other iwi and experts too.\", \"MPI have said they would continue to work alongside Ng\\u0101ti P\\u0101oa to ensure precautions under the r\\u0101hui were followed in accordance with section 186A of the Fisheries Act 1996\", \"The two-year temporary ban will begin from 1 December.\"]","href_hash":"8f4eabb5520e11ec9251197d866fb9e1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8f4eabb5520e11ec9251197d866fb9e1"}},
