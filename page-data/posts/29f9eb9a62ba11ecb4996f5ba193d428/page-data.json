To help, the port established what amounts to four in-land pop-up ports, one hundreds of miles away near the North Carolina border. Now, the number of cargo containers waiting is closer to seven.\", \"\\\"We think these things can be replicated across the nation,\\\" said Griff Lynch, the executive director of the Georgia Ports Authority. \\\"...I see some of them becoming permanent yards where it's actually going to help our business.\\\"\", \"The pop-ups, which were set up in idle rail yards, are now bringing cargo closer to its final destination, while freeing up space at the dock.\", \"The port has been working around the clock \\u2014 24 hours a day \\u2014 loading and unloading giant ships. And it's having an impact. In October, there were 31 vessels waiting offshore to be unloaded. That number has been cut to just six.\", \"\\\"It's that kind of problem solving that I think is going to help us deal with these short term issues, even while we're making big investments for the long run,\\\" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said.\", \"Buttigieg said the Biden administration is now looking to see if similar pop-up sites make sense nationwide. But supply chain delays mean some goods did not make it before the holidays.\", \"When asked if they had solved the problem, Buttigieg said: \\\"We welcome ideas, but look at what we've been able to do cutting some of these container-dwell times in half.
