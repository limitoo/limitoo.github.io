If he is re-elected and serves a full second term, Biden would leave office aged 86.\", \"A poll by Fox News, which is typically critical of the Democratic president, found that most Americans (53 percent) believe his age was interfering with his ability to do his job as president.\", \"The survey by Beacon Research and Shaw & Company Research found views differed across party lines; with 80 percent of Republicans saying Biden's age affected his performance compared with 28 percent of Democrats.\", \"Speculation about Biden's mental acuity, particularly among his conservative critics, often increases if there is a gaffe and raises question marks over whether he will run in 2024. Last month, the White House said that Biden does intend to run for re-election.\", \"The same questions over age could be leveled at Trump, who is flirting with running again in 2024 and enjoys considerable support within the GOP.\", \"Now 75, Trump would be 77 on the campaign trail and 78 in 2024, the same age Biden was when he took the oath of office.\", \"However, both would be spring chickens in seeking election for high office compared with Mahathir bin Mohamad, who was 92 and 141 days old when he was elected again as Malaysia's Prime Minister in 2018.\", \"Musk draws on a wide palette of topics to tweet about in messages that have the power to move cryptocurrency markets. He revealed last month that he often makes his public pronouncements from the most private of places, the toilet.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943955/elon-musk.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Tesla founder Elon Musk is at the Tesla Gigafactory on August 13, 2021 in Gr\\u00fcnheide near Berlin, Germany.
