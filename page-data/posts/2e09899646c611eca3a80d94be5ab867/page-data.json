Four of them are critically injured, he wrote.\", \"A video posted online showed a plume of white smoke rising from the blast scene near the police station. The police did not immediately comment, and it was not clear if the explosions were bomb attacks, though officials have been urging vigilance in the wake of a string of explosions in recent weeks.\", \"One person was killed and at least seven others wounded in an explosion at a restaurant in a suburb of Kampala on Oct. 23.\", \"Another blast, two days later, on a passenger bus, killed only the suicide bomber, according to the police.\", \"Even before those attacks, the British government had updated its Uganda travel advisory to warn that extremists \\u201care very likely to try to carry out attacks\\u201d in the East African country.\", \"The Allied Democratic Forces, an affiliate of the Islamic State group in central Africa, claimed responsibility for the attack on the restaurant.\", \"That group has long been opposed to the rule of longtime President Yoweri Museveni, a U.S. security ally who was the first African leader to deploy peacekeepers in Somalia to protect the federal government from the extremist group Al Shabab.\", \"In retaliation over Uganda\\u2019s deployment of troops to Somalia, Al Shabab carried out attacks in 2010 that killed at least 70 people who had assembled in public places in Kampala to watch a World Cup soccer game.\", \"But the Allied Democratic Forces, with its local roots, has proved more of a headache to Mr. Museveni.\", \"The group was established in the early 1990s by Ugandan Muslims who said that they had been sidelined by Mr. Museveni\\u2019s policies. At the time, the rebel group staged deadly terrorist attacks in Ugandan villages as well as in the capital, including a 1998 attack in which 80 students were massacred in a frontier town near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.\", \"A Ugandan military assault later forced the rebels into eastern Congo, where many rebel groups are able to roam free because the central government has limited control there.\", \"Reports of an alliance between the Allied Democratic Forces and the Islamic State first emerged in 2019, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks the online activities of extremist organizations.\"]","href_hash":"2e09899646c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2e09899646c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
