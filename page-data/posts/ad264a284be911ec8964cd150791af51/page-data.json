Most marchers were peaceful, but some members of far-right groups and others burned masks, threw beer cans at police officers and set off pyrotechnics.\", \"Mass demonstrations also took place in Switzerland, Brussels and the Dutch city of Rotterdam, sometimes punctuated with outbreaks of violence.\", \"There are probably additional restrictions on the way across Europe: Slovakian and German politicians are also discussing a vaccine mandate similar to Austria\\u2019s as the only way to sustainably overcome the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cProbably by the end of this winter, as is sometimes cynically said,\\u201d the German health minister, Jens Spahn, said, \\u201cpretty much everyone in Germany will be vaccinated, recovered or dead.\\u201d\", \"The Austrian states of Salzberg and Upper Austria are among the worst affected, according to my Berlin-based colleague, Christopher Schuetze.\", \"\\u201cThey have had such bad case numbers that, apparently, there was a hospital where they had the dead lying in the hallway, on gurneys,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt is not quite Italy in the spring of 2020, but close to that.\\u201d\", \"Resistance to public health measures is growing. Still, European leaders may feel they have little choice but to implement them, despite the spread of vaccines that were seen a year ago as a fail-proof way out of the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s basically like they\\u2019re in a car going 200 kilometers an hour, driving into the wall,\\u201d Chris said. \\u201cAt some point, someone has to hit the breaks.\\u201d\", \"Some European countries that have imposed strict mandates have seen success.\", \"France has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world after it imposed strict mandates. In Italy, protests against mandates have fizzled. Anti-vaccine backlash has withered in Spain, too.\", \"Vaccination rates dip as you travel east in Europe. Germany, Austria and the German-speaking region of Switzerland have the Continent\\u2019s largest shares of unvaccinated populations: About one in four people over 12 are unvaccinated, compared with about one in 10 in France and Italy and almost zero in Portugal.\", \"To make things worse, Germany is facing a dwindling supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine as it races to provide booster shots.\", \"The Czech Republic and Slovakia are each averaging around 10,000 cases a day, and infections are also high in Greece, Hungary and Croatia. The president of Slovakia, Austria\\u2019s eastern neighbor, also raised the prospect of a universal mandate on Saturday.\", \"Austria\\u2019s nationwide vaccination mandate \\u2014 Europe\\u2019s first \\u2014\\u00a0is set to come fully into force in February. The decision came after months of attempts to halt the spread of the virus through testing and partial restrictions, including a lockdown only for unvaccinated people.\", \"\\u201cPolitically, it\\u2019s very, very unpopular to either have a vaccine mandate or lockdown completely,\\u201d Chris said. \\u201cIt will give the far right a lot of political power. But they\\u2019ve gotten to a point where they cannot not do it. It\\u2019s just gotten so bad.\\u201d\", \"Coronavirus vaccines are a tough sell in South Sudan, the world\\u2019s newest country. Many people recognize the pandemic as a threat\\u00a0\\u2014 just not a very pressing one.\", \"\\u201cWe heard people are dying, but we haven\\u2019t seen anyone sick here,\\u201d said one village leader in a rural area that has suffered from years of flooding. \\u201cWhen you are starving, you don\\u2019t think about other things \\u2014 you need to feed your stomach first.\\u201d\", \"The vast majority of the 11 million people living in one of the poorest countries on Earth have yet to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. The Times photojournalist Lynsey Addario spent almost a week traveling with a U.N. team that was in South Sudan to assess the flood damage and prepare for the vaccine rollout in the region.\", \"\\u201cWhat the children are dying from is malaria, diarrheal diseases, respiratory infections,\\u201d said Yves Willemot, a UNICEF communications officer. \\u201cWe have one child out of 10 that dies before the age of 5, and they don\\u2019t die from Covid-19.\\u201d\", \"Still, in South Sudan\\u2019s capital, Juba, there was a steady stream of people at vaccination sites across the city. One young man had little use for rumors around his neighborhood that the vaccine spreads to the liver and causes death within a year. He wanted a shot so that he could continue studying abroad, in Uganda.\", \"\\u201cIf you don\\u2019t have vaccine.\\u201d he said, \\u201cthey won\\u2019t let us in.\\u201d\", \"Let us know how you\\u2019re dealing with the pandemic.
