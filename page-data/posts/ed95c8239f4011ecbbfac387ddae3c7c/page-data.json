Instead, DHS officials emailed threat information to local Washington D.C. partners before the attack, opting not to issue widespread intelligence alerts.\", \"Messages exchanged between collectors on January 2 and January 3 reveal that DHS employees observed an array of open-source threats on social media and message boards, but ultimately decided they did not meet the reporting threshold. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"People are actually going to try and hurt politicians,\\\" one collector wrote to his colleague on January 2, after finding a map that was circulated online of all the exits and entrances to the Capitol building. \\\"January 6 is gonna be crazy.\\\"\", \"In a different message exchange the following day, DHS analysts called threats unlikely, though one suggested he had some doubts. \\\"I mean people are talking about storming Congress, bringing guns, willing to die for the cause, hanging politicians with ropes,\\\" the collector wrote in a message to a colleague.\", \"Messages from another chat appeared to show two collectors joking about potential threats to lawmakers. \\\"Like there's these people talking about hanging Democrats from ropes like wtf,\\\" one DHS staff member wrote.\", \"\\\"They'd need a lot of rope, I think DC is pretty much all democrat haha,\\\" another responded.\", \"One collector authored a draft of an open-source intelligence report or \\\"OSIR\\\" warning of threats to the U.S. Capitol on January 5, the watchdog found.\", \"During the required peer-review process, the inspector general discovered that another collector concluded the draft report outlining threats to lawmakers and the U.S. Capitol didn't meet the reporting threshold because it \\\"contained hyperbolic information.\\\"\", \"\\\"Overall, open source collectors explained to us that they did not think storming the U.S. Capitol was possible, and, therefore, they dismissed this specific type of threat as hyperbole,\\\" the watchdog found.\", \"Ultimately, the bulletin \\\"was not finalized and disseminated until January 8, two days after the breach,\\\" which \\\"render[ed] it useless.\\\"\", \"When asked about the delay, leadership at the Department of Intelligence and Analysis told the inspector general that officials were not instructed to issue a bulletin before the January 6 events \\\"because there was not enough time.\\\" Instead, the Counterterrorism Mission Center relayed threats only in a briefing with department leadership.\", \"But for weeks, three divisions within DHS' intelligence arm ping-ponged tips back and forth, failing to produce useful guidance to its network of state and local enforcement partners.\", \"On December 21, 2020, the agency's Field Operations Division (FOD) shared information with the Open Source Collection Operations (OSCO) team \\\"about an individual who threatened to shoot and kill protesters at the upcoming rallies related to the presidential election,\\\" after the individual told members of an online discussion group that he planned to kill at least 50 people.
