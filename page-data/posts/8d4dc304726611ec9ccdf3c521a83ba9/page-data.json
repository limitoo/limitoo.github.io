Many of the residents were from the large Gambian community that lived in the neighbourhood.\", \"\\\"This is a global tragedy as The Bronx and New York City is representative of the ethnicities and cultures across the globe,\\\" Adams said during a briefing in front of the building. \\\"This is an evolving crisis.

It was the second major fire in a residential complex in the United States this week after 12 people, including eight children, were killed early on Wednesday whenflames swept through a public housing apartment building in Philadelphia.\", \"Earlier in the day on \\\"Good Morning America,\\\" Adams said smoke from the fire was able to spread due to a door being open. Doors in apartment houses are required to close automatically to prevent fires from spreading through the building.\", \"\\\"There may have been a maintenance issue with this door and that is going to be part of the ongoing investigation,\\\" Adams said. \\\"This is all going to come out during the investigation.\\\"\", \"Addressing the revised death toll, Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said patients had been taken to seven different hospitals in the city, which led to \\\"a bit of a double count,\\\" adding that many remain in care still fighting for their lives. Investigators are looking into the possibility that a door from 15th floor to stairway was not functioning as it should, Nigro said, adding that residents would have been safer if they stayed in their apartments rather than exiting down stairways.\", \"Some 60 people were injured in the blaze and 32 people had been hospitalized with life-threatening injuries, officials said on Sunday.\", \"Fire marshals determined through physical evidence and accounts from residents the fire started in a portable electric heater in the apartment's bedroom. The heat had been on in the apartment building and the portable heater had been supplementing that heating, they said.\", \"Some 200 firefighters helped put out the blaze.\", \"\\\"Many ... of their oxygen tanks were on empty,\\\" Adams said on Monday. \\\"But instead of turning back and exiting the building, they pushed through, through the smoke.\\\"\", \"The building is owned by a joint venture, Bronx Park Phase III Preservation LLC, made up of three firms: LIHC Investment Group, Belveron Partners and Camber Property Group.\", \"The building was constructed in 1972 as part of a state program to provide affordable housing, a spokesperson for the joint venture said.
