This is the first time the health insurance program for older people and those with disabilities has covered an over-the-counter test at no cost to recipients.\", \"The BA.2 omicron variant now accounts for more than half of U.S. cases, having rapidly overtaken the original strain. That initial omicron wave this winter caused the biggest spike yet in virus cases, straining many hospitals to the limit. Since then, cases nationally have rapidly dropped to the lowest level since before last summer's delta surge. Coronavirus restrictions have been largely lifted. But some areas where BA.2 took hold early are seeing increasing cases.\", \"Monday's announcement followed another precautionary move last week, when government health officials authorized a second round of booster shots for people 50 and older as well as those with weakened immune systems.\", \"National pharmacy chains participating in Medicare's give-away include: Albertsons Companies, Inc., Costco Pharmacy, CVS, Food Lion, Giant Food, The Giant Company, Hannaford Pharmacies, H-E-B Pharmacy, Hy-Vee Pharmacy, Kroger Family of Pharmacies, Rite Aid Corp., Shop & Stop, Walgreens and Walmart.\", \"Enrollees may get their free over-the-counter COVID-19 tests from any participating pharmacy or health care provider, whether or not they're customers of the pharmacy or patients of the provider. They do not need to change drug stores where they obtain their prescriptions.\", \"Medicare says the program will continue until the COVID-19 public health emergency ends.\"]","href_hash":"3b79a242b44611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3b79a242b44611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
