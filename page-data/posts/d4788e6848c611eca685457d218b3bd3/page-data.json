Wormuth, the secretary, in a memo this week, which would prevent them from promotions, awards, bonuses and the like. If troops persist in declining, they will not be permitted \\u201ccontinued service\\u201d unless granted an approved exemption from the vaccine, she wrote.\", \"Last week, Oklahoma\\u2019s newly appointed adjutant general for the National Guard, Brig. Gen. Thomas H. Mancino, announced on behalf of Gov. Kevin Stitt that guardsmen in the state would not be required to get a Covid-19 vaccine. The policy defies a Pentagon directive issued in August that makes vaccination mandatory for all troops, including the National Guard, by deadlines set by each service branch.\", \"The memo created a testy stand off between Oklahoma officials and the Pentagon, which insists that all National Guard members must follow the same vaccine procedures as active duty troops. Guard troops are under the authority of the governor unless federally deployed. However, the Pentagon has stood its ground on the notion that its vaccine mandate trumps states\\u2019 rights.\", \"In Oklahoma, 89 percent of airmen in the Guard have been vaccinated, while only 40 percent of Army guardsmen have had shots; the deadline for members of the Army National Guard is coming next month. All branches of the military have been permitted to come up with their own vaccine mandate deadlines for active duty and guard troops, as well as their own punishment systems for refusing shots.\", \"The Pentagon has been wary that other states may follow Oklahoma\\u2019s lead.\", \"Texas Guard officials, for instance, said in an email that the Pentagon appeared to be imposing vaccine mandates on military and National Guard members without adequate protections in place for individuals with religious objections and hinted it, too, might permit members to skip the shots.\", \"The governor of Alaska, Mike Dunleavy, has also issued a memo noting that \\u201cPresident Biden and his Administration have taken actions, or announced plans to act, that threaten the sovereign authority of the State of Alaska,\\u201d which included \\u201cimposing vaccine mandates on military and National Guard members without adequate protections in place for individuals with religious objections.\\u201d\", \"In essence, Texas and Alaska appear to be engaged in a passive version of the Oklahoma written policy. \\u201cWe are awaiting additional guidance from the Departments of the U.S. Army and Air Force that addresses National Guard requirements,\\u201d said Candis Olmstead, a spokeswoman for the Alaska Guard, in an email. \", \"So far, the Defense Department has granted a smattering of exemptions from vaccines, including for people who were already leaving the military or who have medical issues, but those for religious reasons are still pending.\"]","href_hash":"d4788e6848c611eca685457d218b3bd3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d4788e6848c611eca685457d218b3bd3"}},
