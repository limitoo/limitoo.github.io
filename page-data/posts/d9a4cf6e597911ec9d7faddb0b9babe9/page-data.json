As Joan Didion wrote in \\u201cThe White Album,\\u201d \\u201cWe tell ourselves stories in order to live.\\u201d In an often illogical, chaotic world, narratives can be a salve or a method of survival. They can help us grasp what Didion called \\u201cthe shifting phantasmagoria\\u201d of the human experience. But what if a community\\u2019s identity is intertwined with the incomprehensible cruelties of human bondage?\", \"In \\u201cThe People Remember,\\u201d a picture book written by Ibi Zoboi, a 2017 National Book Award finalist for her young adult novel \\u201cAmerican Street,\\u201d and illustrated by Loveis Wise, African American history begins with the trans-Atlantic slave trade. But Zoboi and Wise don\\u2019t sensationalize violence or wallow in sorrow. Their collaboration focuses on Black resilience, a cultural inheritance powerful enough to break the curse of generational trauma. Guided by the seven principles of Kwanzaa (unity; self-determination; collective work and responsibility; cooperative economics; purpose; creativity; and faith), Zoboi\\u2019s narrative explores both the burden and the strength of collective consciousness.\", \"The book begins \\u201cduring a time of war,\\u201d with the capture and enslavement of Africans across the continent. Zoboi chants the names of the various nation-states of the diaspora (\\u201cthe Ashanti and the Fulani, the Empire of Mali, the Hausa and Ibo, as well as the Kongo, the Yoruba and Akan, the Empire of Songhai, the Kingdom of Dahomey, the Mende and the Fon\\u201d) and recounts how chiefs and kings sold \\u201cthe people\\u201d to white men who forced them into \\u201cropes that bound them.\\u201d She alludes to the horrors of the journey across the ocean by noting that \\u201csome jumped\\u201d into the embrace of the water spirit Mami Wata, who \\u201cmaybe, just maybe \\u2026 was their mother.\\u201d\", \"Wise\\u2019s illustrations imbue Zoboi\\u2019s lyrical text with mythological import. A particularly effective spread depicts a Black woman leading another Black woman and a girl with braids through the dead of a blue-velvet night. She points out the constellations above, as a waxing crescent moon glows with soft yellow light. Zoboi\\u2019s accompanying text discusses how, when slavery ripped families apart, \\u201cthe North Star was freedom\\u201d and Harriet Tubman and Nat Turner \\u201cled the way.\\u201d The image and the words work in harmony to emphasize the limitless potential of the human spirit. Later spreads spotlight the innovation and creativity of Black trailblazers in the arts.\", \"As Zoboi moves farther along the timeline of American history, she rejects the belief that Blackness is rooted in suffering and focuses on the sacred refuge of community. \\u201cAll these people from different African nations had to learn one common language and create a culture that combined their memories of home in Africa with new traditions that allowed them to survive and thrive,\\u201d she explains in her author\\u2019s note, which is paired with educational back matter. Those on the younger end of the book\\u2019s target age group will appreciate Wise\\u2019s illustrations more than they will the text\\u2019s lessons, but all ages should enjoy the cadence and rhythm of Zoboi\\u2019s verse.\", \"\\u201cThe People Remember\\u201d provides an overview of the genesis and evolution of African American culture, but it is not meant to be a definitive tribute. Survival is in part the result of adaptation, of metamorphosis. For Zoboi, to remember is to honor both the wisdom of the dead and the gospels of the living.\"]","href_hash":"d9a4cf6e597911ec9d7faddb0b9babe9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d9a4cf6e597911ec9d7faddb0b9babe9"}},
