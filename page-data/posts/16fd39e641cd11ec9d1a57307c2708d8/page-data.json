What is questionable is The Times\\u2019s description of that reality.\", \"Polls consistently show that a majority of Americans (including many Republicans) support many of Build Back Better\\u2019s initiatives: lower prescription drug prices, support for child care and early childhood education, and more. Even more consistently, polls make it clear that large majorities want the people and big businesses that make the most money to pay their fair share of taxes \\u2014 which would go a long way toward paying for the programs Americans want.\", \"Calling this \\u201ca sharp leftward push\\u201d is mistaken, and focusing on the old boogeymen of costs and growing the government is an anachronistic analysis.\", \"Joe Biden was elected in part to end Donald Trump\\u2019s war on our government. His promise was to make government work for Americans, not to make it smaller. The largest part of Democrats\\u2019 peril is their failure to do that \\u2014 largely the fault of moderates. If Democrats can\\u2019t make government work, they deserve the consequences. Unfortunately, the nation does not.\", \"Gail GoldeyHarrison, N.Y.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"I certainly hope that this editorial will get the attention of Democratic members of Congress!\", \"I am a liberal Democrat who decries the party infighting and obstructionism. These are not normal times, where we can have arcane political arguments about the fine points of policy. This is now Trump world \\u2014 an ex-president who actually tried to foment a coup, supported and enabled by his Republican Party.\", \"So while factions in my party are being intransigent, they are also making the president look weak and ineffective and reminding voters that we can be chaotic, too \\u2014 ergo our recent electoral losses.\", \"Face reality is right! Either coalesce and compromise and do some great things for the American people, or have the G.O.P. take over Congress and re-elect Donald Trump as president, which will cause us to fail as a country.\", \"Carol KrainesDeerfield, Ill.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Your editorial gets it exactly wrong.\", \"You call for the Democrats to moderate in the face of the electorate\\u2019s lurch toward the angry and disaffected right. The problem is that our society is broken. People are angry, people are disaffected. The progressives are the ones speaking to these people, with salvos against the destruction of the working class and obscene levels of inequality. Add in the energy of the young and engaged citizens who want to prevent the destruction of our planet.\", \"The progressives among us are our only hope to lead our country with a mandate of the majority.\", \"Mark KnobilPittsburgh\", \"To the Editor:\", \"The irony is overwhelming. The advice the editorial page gives to the Democratic Party is to ignore the Times editorial page. This is certainly excellent advice, and had the Democratic Party and the Biden administration followed it, the recent electoral losses might well have been smaller. Nonetheless, it leaves the reader puzzled as to how to apply this advice to the endless stream of progressive editorials that are certain to follow.\", \"Jonathan BlankNew York\", \"To the Editor:\", \"I respectfully disagree with your analysis of the setbacks suffered by the Democratic Party in the recent elections. You give our divided citizenry too much credit. Ask the ordinary voter what he knows \\u2014 not thinks \\u2014 about matters like inflation, the state of the pandemic, the teaching of critical race theory, etc., and I am pretty sure you will come up with very little. We voters are vocal about what we think, even if we don\\u2019t know much about the subject at hand.\", \"Democrats, notably President Biden, refuse to admit that trying to reason with a party that only offers opposition is futile. The ideal of uniting the country is lofty but currently unrealistic. The G.O.P. over a long period has mastered the art of short, emotionally loaded phrases to manipulate its constituents and the unwary.\", \"The media are being too quick to judge a presidency that is not yet a year old. Disappointing.\", \"Norma GausterAvon, Conn.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cRodgers Sees Covid Rules as Senseless\\u201d (Sports, Nov. 6):\", \"Aaron Rodgers\\u2019s response is taken right from the former president\\u2019s playbook, which is increasingly becoming a template for high-profile people who mess up. The parallels are uncanny.\", \"Let\\u2019s be clear. While many folks are angry that Rodgers, the Green Bay Packers\\u2019 star quarterback, isn\\u2019t vaccinated, the real issue here is that he knowingly broke the rules. And doesn\\u2019t think he should be held accountable.\", \"Rather than step up, Rodgers acted indignant, and tried to confuse the issue, provide alternative facts, play down the implications of his actions, highlight his critical thinking, and dare the powers that be to fully hold him accountable. This is the \\u201cstable genius\\u201d approach. He\\u2019s so principled about this issue that he could express his true beliefs only after getting caught.\", \"This isn\\u2019t about the woke mob and cancel culture, as he claims. It\\u2019s about not being a jerk. And not thinking you\\u2019re above the rules. And accountability.\", \"It\\u2019s quaint to think about the days when at least some people in leadership positions actually apologized and took responsibility for their misdeeds.
