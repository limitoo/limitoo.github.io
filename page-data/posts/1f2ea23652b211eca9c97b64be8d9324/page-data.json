But now the company has released more information about the project.\", \"Concept H is a five-seater electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft that Pantuo Aviation says will be capable of reaching speeds of more than 186 miles per hour and could have a range of 155 miles.\", \"A spokesperson for the company told Interesting Engineering that the concept is powered by lithium-ion batteries and features 22 electric ducted fans. The wings of the aircraft will be able to tilt in order to transition from vertical to normal flight mode.\", \"In a statement on their website, the company said: \\\"The large-diameter distributed electric ducted fans replace rotors in traditional helicopters and open propellers of current generation eVTOLs. These fans provide tremendous thrust reserve and maneuverability during hover, greatly reduce noise during operation, and provide passengers with an enhanced level of safety.\", \"\\\"The innovative tilting propulsion wing system provides precise and easy transition. The clean aerodynamics shape enables high speed and long-range cruise.\\\"\", \"The company says the design of the eVTOL aircraft will enable it to achieve levels of safety similar to those of large passenger airplanes.\", \"\\\"At same time, its advanced computing power and network capability makes it ready for the coming revolution in autonomy.\\\" the statement said.\", \"The concept features a \\\"spacious, open and streamlined cabin,\\\" that will be reminiscent of a luxury sedan, the company said.\", \"\\\"With advanced human-machine-interface in its cockpit design from the start, it aims to simplify vehicle operation, lower operating cost, and enhance operational safety,\\\" the company said.\", \"The aircraft is currently only at the concept stage so the claims made cannot be verified at this point. But the Pantuo Aviation spokesperson told Interesting Engineering that they are developing a sub-scale flight model, which will enable the firm to test technologies that will feature on the final the aircraft.\", \"The company says it plans to perform its first fight test of this initial prototype around the end of the year. Development of the full model is expected to begin in 2022, while the company hopes to earn certification and begin its taxi service by 2027 at the latest.\", \"The Pantala Concept H bears similarities to the eVTOL flying taxi designed by German company Lilium, which is at a significantly more advanced staged of development and could come into service by 2024.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943119/pantala-concept-h-evtol-aircraft.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">An illustration the Pantala Concept H eVTOL aircraft created by Chinese company Pantuo Aviation.</div>\"]","href_hash":"1f2ea23652b211eca9c97b64be8d9324"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1f2ea23652b211eca9c97b64be8d9324"}},
