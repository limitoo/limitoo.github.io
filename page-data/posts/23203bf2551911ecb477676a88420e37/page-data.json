Kathy Hochul said this week. At the same time, tens of thousands of health care workers have left their health care jobs, for reasons ranging from pandemic burnout to a refusal to get vaccinated in spite of the state\\u2019s strict mandate for health care workers, and some systems have posted hundreds of available job openings.\", \"The result has been a decrease in upstate hospital capacity of about 10 percent. And a perfect storm of high patient volumes, reduced staff and an inability to discharge patients to nursing homes \\u2014 which are themselves full \\u2014 has begun to overwhelm some facilities, particularly in Western New York, the Finger Lakes region and a swath of the state north of Albany, hospital executives said.\", \"With Omicron now detected in New York City and on Long Island and the variant expected to spread, and few hospital beds upstate available for patients if Covid hospitalizations spike even higher, Ms. Hochul has declared a state of emergency.\", \"On Wednesday, she announced that 120 National Guard troops would be deployed to back up nursing home staffs around the state. The governor\\u2019s office has so far announced nine facilities \\u2014 nursing homes in Rochester, Buffalo, on Long Island and elsewhere \\u2014 where soldiers will work. More locations will be announced soon.\", \"The governor also said that all hospitals at over 90 percent capacity may be ordered to stop elective surgeries to deal with the surge. There were 56 hospitals in that category on Friday, including 10 in New York City, some of which had already taken that step.\", \"\\u201cHospitalizations are up, get this number, 150 percent upstate versus downstate,\\u201d Ms. Hochul said on Monday, of the rise in Covid hospitalizations since August. \\u201cNot that I\\u2019m trying to create an upstate-downstate divide in our state,\\u201d she added, \\u201cbut these are the numbers we\\u2019re seeing and they\\u2019re very troubling.\\u201d\", \"\"]","href_hash":"23203bf2551911ecb477676a88420e37"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"23203bf2551911ecb477676a88420e37"}},
