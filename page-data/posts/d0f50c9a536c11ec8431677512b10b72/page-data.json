Then it takes a jarring step back in time to greener pastures. In a hat tip to \\u201cThe Shining,\\u201d an aerial shot captures an S.U.V. making its way through winding backcountry roads. Just as agonizing as the screaming and blood of the opening, if not more so, is the conversation inside the car where members of a progressive canvassing group, on its way to recruit white female voters, talks politics nonstop.\", \"Cheery alternative rock music and a pit stop that involves the diverse group of friends\\u2019 tearing down a racist sign suggest that the filmmaker, the Tony-winning actress Tonya Pinkins, has satirical objectives.
