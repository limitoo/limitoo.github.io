Chief Sewell, 49, was chosen from among a field of rumored candidates from within the New York Police Department and from larger police departments around the country. \", \"Mr. Adams, a former police captain, ran as a centrist in the Democratic primary, promising to address a troubling rise in violence and to rein in police abuse. He will be counting on Chief Sewell to help him strike that balance. \", \"In a statement, Mr. Adams called Chief Sewell \\u201ca proven crime fighter with the experience and emotional intelligence to deliver both the safety New Yorkers need and the justice they deserve.\\u201d \", \"Chief Sewell comes from a department that has about 2,400 uniformed officers \\u2014 less than a tenth of the size of the roughly 35,000 officers employed by the New York Police Department.\", \"A person close to Mr. Adams said he had been impressed by Chief Sewell\\u2019s confidence and competence, and her experience working undercover. Her interview process was rigorous and included a mock news conference about the shooting of an unarmed Black man by a white police officer, the person said.\", \"In 23 years with the Nassau Police Department, Chief Sewell, who grew up in Queens, worked in the narcotics and major cases units, and as a hostage negotiator. She was promoted to chief of detectives in September 2020. \", \"Chief Sewell has been viewed as a rising star in policing circles and well prepared for the role, said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which advises departments on best practices.\", \"\\u201cThis is a case of someone identifying her early on in her career and moving her up,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThis is someone who has experienced every part of the department from patrol to internal affairs.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Adams will announce her appointment at Queensbridge Houses in Long Island City in Queens, where Chief Sewell lived as a child. It was first reported by The New York Post on Tuesday evening.\", \"In January, Chief Sewell will take over the New York Police Department at what could be the most consequential moment in two decades. A national crisis of trust in American policing has emboldened efforts to reduce the department\\u2019s footprint, even as murder and shooting rates remain higher than they were before the pandemic. The relationship between the department and the city\\u2019s police unions is strained, and there have been growing calls for more transparency over policing tactics and disciplinary procedures.\", \"Mr. Adams, who will become the city\\u2019s second Black mayor, has criticized the left-wing movement to defund the police and has pledged to remove guns from the streets; he has also insisted that the city will be more proactive in removing abusive officers from the department. \", \"Chief Sewell will also be the third Black commissioner to lead the city\\u2019s Police Department \\u2014 a notable change for a police force whose upper echelons have remained overwhelmingly white and male.\", \"Mr. Adams has promised major changes for the Police Department: bringing back plainclothes police units that were disbanded last year; diversifying a department where Black officers are underrepresented; and speeding up the disciplinary process for officers accused of wrongdoing.\", \"For months, Mr. Adams had said that he would name the department\\u2019s first female leader in its 176-year history and considered several candidates, including Carmen Best, the former Seattle police chief; and Juanita Holmes, the current chief of patrol in New York. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat in his second term, had selected three Irish American veterans of the department for the top job.\", \"Laura Curran, the Nassau County executive, said in an interview on Tuesday that Chief Sewell was a \\u201cwonderful choice\\u201d to lead the New York Police Department.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m really happy for her and really happy for the city,\\u201d Ms. Curran said, adding that Chief Sewell had \\u201call of the skills and the temperament to do the job and do it well.\\u201d \", \"On Tuesday night, Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the major police union, said officers looked forward to working with her.\", \"\\u201cWe welcome Chief Sewell to the second-toughest policing job in America,\\u201d he said in a statement. \\u201cThe toughest, of course, is being an NYPD cop on the street.\\u201d\", \"\"]","href_hash":"5117cd3a5d4911ec9cc8496cd7339513"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5117cd3a5d4911ec9cc8496cd7339513"}},
