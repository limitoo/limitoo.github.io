That support would come from reservists.\\u00a0\", \"According to the administration official, Russia has embarked on a sudden and rapid program to establish a ready reserve of contract reservists \\u2014 something that was not seen back in the spring during a rapid Russian military buildup near Ukraine's borders.\", \"A National Security Council spokesperson said the Biden administration has been consistent in its message to Russia, which is that the United States does not seek conflict, and that diplomacy and de-escalation should be used to avert a crisis.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We are deeply concerned by evidence that Russia is stepping up its planning for significant military action against Ukraine,\\\" the spokesperson told CBS News.\\u00a0\", \"The U.S. and other officials have been sounding the alarm in recent weeks over Russian troops massing, concerned that an offensive or an escalation of a seven-year-long conflict in the volatile eastern region of Donbas could be on the horizon.\", \"Russian officials, however, have said reports of a military buildup are baseless and in turn accused NATO of building more of a foothold in what Russia considers its own backyard.
