Gen. Sami D. Said, said that was wrong. \\u201cWe have not found any particular safe house,\\u201d he said in a telephone interview after making his findings public last week.\", \"General Said would not discuss the underlying information that led military analysts to focus on the safe house \\u2014 and even dispatch six Reaper drones to monitor it \\u2014 other than to say, \\u201cIt was not faulty intelligence; it was just not specific.\\u201d A second U.S. military official confirmed that the available intelligence on the location was not precise enough.\", \"Nearly everything senior defense officials asserted in the hours, then days and weeks, after the drone strike has turned out to be false. The explosives the military claimed were loaded in the trunk of a white Toyota sedan struck by the drone\\u2019s Hellfire missile were probably water bottles, and a secondary explosion in the courtyard in a densely populated Kabul neighborhood where the attack took place was probably a propane or gas tank, officials said.\", \"Senior Defense Department leaders have conceded that the driver of the car, Zemari Ahmadi, a longtime worker for a U.S. aid group, had nothing to do with the Islamic State, contrary to what military officials had previously asserted. Mr. Ahmadi\\u2019s only connection to the terrorist group appeared to be a fleeting and innocuous interaction with people in what the military believed was an ISIS safe house in Kabul.\", \"But now Pentagon officials say that judgment was also mistaken, after an investigation by The New York Times that the safe house\\u2019s location was actually the residence of Mr. Ahmadi\\u2019s boss, who American military officials also say has no ties to ISIS.\", \"General Said found no violations of law and did not recommend any disciplinary action. He said a series of assumptions, made over the course of eight hours as U.S. officials tracked the white Toyota Corolla through Kabul, caused what he called \\u201cconfirmation bias,\\u201d leading to the drone strike.\", \"General Said\\u2019s investigation made several recommendations for fixing the process through which strikes are ordered, including new measures to cut down the risk of confirmation bias and a review of the procedures used to determine whether civilians are present.\", \"Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III has approved General Said\\u2019s findings and recommendations, the chief Pentagon spokesman, John F. Kirby, said last week, and has left it up to the four-star generals leading the military\\u2019s Central and Special Operations commands to decide, probably in the next few weeks, whether anyone should be disciplined or rebuked for the strike.\", \"In describing his investigation, General Said said last week that surveillance videos showed at least one child in the area some two minutes before the military launched the drone strike. But the general also said that footage would have been easy to miss in real time.\", \"In the subsequent interview, General Said provided additional details, saying that nine seconds before military operators fired the missile, surveillance video showed the presence of four adults and two children \\u2014 the largest number of people captured on video before the strike. According to General Said, that group of people \\u2014 in addition to Mr. Ahmadi and his cousin, whom analysts clearly saw before launching the strike \\u2014 would have also been easy to miss.\", \"Separately, three U.S. officials said on Monday that the C.I.A. had alerted the military to the presence of a child at the strike site on Aug. 29 but that military officials said the warning came too late \\u2014 after the missile was launched.\", \"General Said and other top military officials, including Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of the Central Command, have sought to put the drone strike into the context of the moment, with American officials at a heightened state of alert after a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport three days earlier killed about 170 civilians and 13 U.S. troops.\", \"The military\\u2019s first mistake was incorrectly identifying a family home as an Islamic State safe house. \\u201cIn the 48 hours prior to the strike, sensitive intelligence indicated that the compound at point No. 1 on the map was being used by ISIS-K planners, used to facilitate future attacks,\\u201d General McKenzie told reporters at his Sept. 17 briefing, referring to an Islamic State affiliate.\", \"Another recurring aspect of the intelligence, General McKenzie said, was that ISIS would use a white Toyota Corolla as a key element in the next attack against American troops at the airport.\", \"At 8:52 a.m. on Aug. 29, a white Toyota Corolla \\u2014 Mr. Ahmadi\\u2019s sedan \\u2014 arrived at what the military believed was an ISIS safe house.\", \"But witness testimony and visual evidence gathered by The Times indicate that this compound was most likely the home of Mr. Ahmadi\\u2019s boss, the country director of Nutrition and Education International, a California-based aid group. The director had asked Mr. Ahmadi to stop by his home to pick up his laptop on the way to work that morning.\", \"According to General Said, military analysts suspected on Aug. 29 that the suicide bomber had at some point three days earlier carried explosives in a black bag similar to a laptop bag. Seeing a black bag being exchanged at a suspected ISIS safe house the morning of the attack was yet another data point that generated confirmation bias, the general said.\"]","href_hash":"2218e1be40ec11ec9e2d63f38de8c951"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2218e1be40ec11ec9e2d63f38de8c951"}},
