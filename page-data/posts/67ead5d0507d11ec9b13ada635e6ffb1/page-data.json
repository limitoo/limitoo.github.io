Here is one song from each of those 20 in chronological order, highlighting a genius that was evident from a jarringly early age (even if critics took a while to catch on) for mixing longing and ambivalence into clever, spiky, dependably unexpected lyrics.\", \"Dyspepsia lurks way in the background of \\u201cSaturday Night,\\u201d his first complete musical (which wouldn\\u2019t see a New York stage until almost a half-century later). But in this song, performed here by Liz Callaway, Sondheim depicts a level of dewy-eyed optimism \\u2014 \\u201cWhy, I can see half a tree/And what more do I need?\\u201d \\u2014 that will become rare in his later musicals, which tended to pull the rug out on his clearly deluded dreamers. Here is the work of someone barely out of college who can\\u2019t believe he is already creating would-be standards.\", \"If this were a list of Leonard Bernstein songs, \\u201cMaria\\u201d or \\u201cTonight\\u201d or \\u201cSomewhere\\u201d might easily take this spot. But it fell upon Sondheim to depict the inchoate yearnings of a street youth, played by Larry Kert, and offer a plausible glimpse into a mind barely able to glimpse it himself. Sondheim spent the next 60-plus years grumbling about the quality of his \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d lyrics: the unintelligible passages, the too-clever-by-half internal rhymes. We should all be so flawed.\", \"How to pick just one song from what many consider is the greatest musical ever? None other than Cole Porter gasped at one of Sondheim\\u2019s lyrics in \\u201cTogether, Wherever We Go,\\u201d and \\u201cEverything\\u2019s Coming Up Roses\\u201d earned the 29-year-old a spot in Bartlett\\u2019s book of quotations. But it is Ethel Merman\\u2019s absolute tour de force \\u2014 one that, owing to the composer Jule Styne\\u2019s previous engagement one fateful night, Sondheim largely willed into being at a rehearsal piano \\u2014 that gave the clearest example of what lay ahead.\", \"The galumphing opening chords marked the first time Broadway audiences heard Sondheim\\u2019s music as well as lyrics. And they were this close to instead hearing an opening number called \\u201cLove Is in the Air,\\u201d which is sprightly and charming and the absolute wrong way to kick off an evening of vaudeville turns and eunuch jokes. Luckily, Jerome Robbins caught an out-of-town performance just before its New York transfer and mentioned this to Sondheim, who wrote that weekend the no less hummable \\u201cComedy Tonight,\\u201d sung here by Jason Alexander. As exacting as he was with his notes and his words, Sondheim did what he had to do in order to make a show work.\", \"There is a frequently cited notion (one that Sondheim just as frequently refuted) that the show\\u2019s title song represents the purest, most unadulterated look into his own emotionally stunted psyche. Leaving that aside, the song \\u2014 performed on the original cast recording by Lee Remick \\u2014 is a bittersweet oasis in a show stuffed with ideas and set pieces and pastiche numbers and the sorts of Big Ideas that Sondheim would soon learn to convey more adroitly. It\\u2019s not all so simple, not by a long shot.\", \"Sondheim didn\\u2019t want to go back to solely writing lyrics, and he quickly regretted teaming up with Richard Rodgers, the longtime writing partner of Sondheim\\u2019s mentor, Oscar Hammerstein II. One of the collaboration\\u2019s many skirmishes involved this song, a wry evisceration of an unhappy marriage that apparently sounded an awful lot like Rodgers\\u2019s own. The version that made it to opening night is clever; the one that got tossed, later resurrected and sung here by Jason Danieley and Marin Mazzie, is brilliant.\", \"Not even the \\u201cI want\\u201d song remained intact in Sondheim\\u2019s visionary hands. This quirky made-for-TV romance, in which the female lead ruminates on the years she has lived inside a department store and pines to see the sky again, had all but disappeared until Mandy Patinkin invited his \\u201cSunday in the Park With George\\u201d co-star Bernadette Peters to record the score with him on a 1990 album. With its trees like broken umbrellas and ice like vinyl, the song is more than a little bit creepy and altogether marvelous.\", \"Possibly the greatest artistic hot streak of the 20th century (take note of the dates on this and the next two entries) began with this quasi-Brechtian look at marriage through the eyes of 35-year-old Bobby, who \\u2014 maybe, sort of, kind of \\u2014 wants no part of it. This anxiety-drenched patter song from one of his friends, sung on the original cast album by Beth Howland, doesn\\u2019t do much to allay Bobby\\u2019s fears. In the process, the already high-bar of Sondheim\\u2019s lyrical virtuosity vaulted several notes higher.\", \"The word \\u201cambivalence\\u201d typically surfaces in a discussion of Sondheim and his themes, with \\u201cCompany\\u201d as Exhibit A. (That score includes the song \\u201cSorry-Grateful.\\u201d) But while the \\u201cFollies\\u201d score is chockablock with such barn burners as \\u201cBroadway Baby\\u201d and \\u201cI\\u2019m Still Here,\\u201d along with the piercing \\u201cLosing My Mind,\\u201d this character study, sung on the original cast album by John McMartin, sublimely lays the groundwork for the misgivings to come. And its final two lines \\u2014 \\u201cThe Ben I\\u2019ll never be/Who remembers him?\\u201d \\u2014 should hang in a museum.\", \"The haunting \\u201cEvery Day a Little Death\\u201d and the virtuosic triptych of lust that is \\u201cNow/Soon/Later\\u201d would be career-defining works for just about anyone else. But any time Sarah Vaughan, as heard here, and Frank Sinatra and Judy Collins and Barbra Streisand and Judi Dench and Krusty the Clown of \\u201cThe Simpsons\\u201d can agree on anything, let alone a bittersweet rumination on lost love with an oscillating time signature, the choice is obvious.\", \"As reluctant as Sondheim was to write lyrics for other composers, it was almost unheard of for him to write music for other people\\u2019s lyrics. But he made an exception for William Shakespeare (as one tends to do) in this curiosity that debuted in a Yale University swimming pool and reached Broadway 30 years later. In this adaptation of an Aristophanes comedy, Shakespeare squares off against George Bernard Shaw in an agon, the high-stakes debate that was common in ancient Greek comedies; Sondheim\\u2019s gossamer arrangement of this soliloquy from \\u201cCymbeline,\\u201d sung here by George Hearn, helps earn the Bard a ticket out of the underworld.\", \"Sondheim described the frequent request to name a favorite of his own songs as \\u201cunderstandable but unanswerable.\\u201d Still, he repeatedly answered it anyway by suggesting this prismatic song, in which an eyewitness and an earwitness give markedly different accounts of a meeting (accounts that are muddied further by the re-recollections of the eyewitness as an old man). Perhaps it was his wish to essentially elevate his audiences to collaborators: Whether high up in a branch or seated in a Broadway theater, the very act of experiencing something makes that thing real (\\u201cWithout someone in a tree/Nothing happened here\\u201d).\", \"Seconds before this song, the titular \\u201cDemon Barber of Fleet Street\\u201d has morphed from a revenge seeker into an indiscriminate psychopath in the bruising aria \\u201cEpiphany.\\u201d Only one song remains before intermission. How could the tension possibly heighten even further? It can\\u2019t, and so Sondheim (and book writer Hugh Wheeler) instead puncture it with an uproarious one-liner from Sweeney\\u2019s murderous counterpart, Mrs. Lovett, followed by a ghoulish list song \\u2014 possibly the greatest of Act I finales \\u2014 in which the two, here Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou on the original cast album, make macabre sport of listing the various individuals they plan to grind into meat pies.\", \"What do you call a recapitulation whose narrative unspools backward? A precapitulation? The DNA of this sadder-but-wiser lament can be found throughout the show, including in an earlier (or later, by the show\\u2019s logic) up-tempo iteration and in the evening\\u2019s very first (which makes it the very last) piece of music, a high school commencement song. But the third (first?) time is the charm, complete with a devastating and just-flashy-enough final line that helped turn it into a crossover hit for Sinatra, heard here.\", \"Seeing as Sondheim named not one but two books after this song (the second edition is called \\u201cLook, I Made a Hat,\\u201d and both are essential reading), it clearly had significance for him. As a teenager, I thought this depiction of creation \\u2014 and the combination of rigor and abandon that it requires \\u2014 ended on a note that was equal parts proud and rueful. How wrong I was about the rueful part. And the immensity of \\u201cWhat you feel like, planning a sky,\\u201d sung here by Mandy Patinkin, will never dissipate.\", \"So many of the most astonishing moments in Sondheim\\u2019s lyrics come from decisions made then and there: young Gypsy Rose Lee finding her voice mid-striptease, Bobby in \\u201cCompany\\u201d resolving to be alive by not being alone, Sweeney Todd settling on the idea of mass slaughter. Perhaps the most beguiling is this number, in which Cinderella, played here Kim Crosby, turns the act of leaving her glass slipper behind into a conscious choice. Sondheim credited his \\u201cWoods\\u201d book writer, James Lapine, for the idea, but the sparkling execution is his alone.\", \"More than 30 years into a convention-shattering career, Sondheim still raised eyebrows when he announced he was about to musicalize the likes of John Hinckley Jr. and John Wilkes Booth. Some of those eyebrows never totally lowered: A Broadway revival was postponed in the wake of 9/11. But this early set-piece, in which Booth (Victor Garber, joined by Patrick Cassidy as the Balladeer) mashes up grandiose poetry, self-pity, cogent criticism and vile racism in a plaintive cri de coeur, went a long way toward reminding audiences that they were in very good and very frightening hands.\", \"Madonna\\u2019s slinky \\u201cSooner or Later\\u201d may have won the Academy Award, and \\u201cMore\\u201d may be more chockablock with musical theater Easter eggs. But it\\u2019s this Harold Arlen-inspired song of unrequited love that gives Warren Beatty\\u2019s rather cluttered film the closest thing to a heartbeat. Sondheim\\u2019s original duet has become a heart-rending solo for the likes of Audra McDonald, Gavin Creel and, from his virtual 90th-birthday celebration, Judy Kuhn.\", \"\\u201cPassion\\u201d was the first musical I saw (and saw again and again) in its original run. And those initial audiences hated Fosca, the grasping, manipulative, unprepossessing third point of the show\\u2019s love triangle. This song comes late in the piece, just as she reappeared in a way that had people around me snickering and groaning at the mere sight of her. These 135 seconds \\u2014 one of Sondheim\\u2019s simpler melodies \\u2014 changed pretty much everything. Fosca, played here by Donna Murphy, was every bit as suffocating as before, and maybe even more baffling. She was also a heroine.\", \"This show \\u2014 which started as \\u201cWise Guys\\u201d and then became \\u201cBounce\\u201d before settling as \\u201cRoad Show,\\u201d each time with a starry new director and a commensurate lurch in direction \\u2014 went through very public growing pains, including an ill-fated reunion with Hal Prince and lawsuits with Scott Rudin. This melancholy charmer, sung by a doting mother (here, Alma Cuervo) about her ne\\u2019er-do-well son, entered the show\\u2019s ever-changing song stack fairly early on and remained a high point each step of the way.\"]","href_hash":"67ead5d0507d11ec9b13ada635e6ffb1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"67ead5d0507d11ec9b13ada635e6ffb1"}},
