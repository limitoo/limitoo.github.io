popular tourist town of Byron Bay on\\u00a0May 31, 2019.\", \"He was last seen leaving\\u00a0Cheeky Monkey's nightclub but mobile phone data revealed\\u00a0he travelled in the opposite direction to his hostel\\u00a0and toward\\u00a0the Cape Byron lighthouse.\", \"A two-week coronial inquest will begin in Byron Bay on Monday with opening statements and a site visit to several key locations.\", \"A large number\\u00a0of overseas witnesses are expected to give evidence during the inquest.\", \"Theo's mother, father, brother and grandmother were granted exemptions to travel\\u00a0from Belgium to Australia for the inquest.\", \"His godfather, Jean-Philippe Pector, and cousin, Lisa Hayez, have also travelled from interstate to be in Byron Bay with the rest of the family during the

of allocating police time and energy to other paths of investigation,\\\" the family said in a statement.\", \"\\\"We believe\\u00a0this new review of Theo's disappearance should be under the guidance of specialised missing person investigators and the NSW Police Missing Persons Registry, which was established with its new structure just a few months after Theo went missing.\\\"\", \"The family
