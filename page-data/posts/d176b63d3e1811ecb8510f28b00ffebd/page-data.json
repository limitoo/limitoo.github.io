So how do homeowners and architects take on this challenge \\u2014 one that is rewarded with glorious, unobstructed ocean vistas, but also full of potential problems \\u2014 and still sleep well?\", \"Building a home attached to a sheer wall of rock means balancing aesthetic temptations with the realities of exposure, accessibility, zoning issues and design. Jaime Bartolom\\u00e9 Yllera, co-founder of GilBartolome Architects, says that the danger is part of the draw.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s in some sense dangerous, but you can safely experience it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cEngineering goes a long way.\\u201d\", \"His firm won the bid to build the House on the Cliff in Salobre\\u00f1a, on Spain\\u2019s Costa Tropical, with a design that Mr. Yllera calls a \\u201ccave model,\\u201d cut like a triangular bite into the side of an incline, in this case at a 42-degree grade.\", \"Mr. Yllera fabricated micropiles that dig 60 feet deep into the ground and drilled anchors horizontally 60 feet into the rock.\", \"\\u201cFor that house to fall into the sea, the whole mountain would have to go into the sea,\\u201d he said.\", \"The construction crew started by excavating earth to make a vertical retaining wall. Whereas houses on level land are built from the foundation up, houses in the cave model are built from the retaining wall downward: Other floors are added below it, like building a set of stairs from the second floor down.\", \"Though houses built this way can incur additional construction costs, Mr. Yllera said they were able to build the 2,400-square-foot House on the Cliff for about $200 per square foot, including the retaining wall and the bespoke furniture, for a total construction cost around $480,000.\", \"To take on this challenge as a homeowner, Mr. Yllera said, \\u201cyou have to have energy. You get all sorts of challenges, so to be worth it for the client, someone really has to have the vision.\\u201d\", \"The owners of the home, Sandra and Jaime Vecino, had a vision from the first time they saw the property, riding past it on his father\\u2019s boat. They were living in Madrid, but Mr. Vecino had always summered with his family in the area, hoping he\\u2019d find a place there to build a house of his own.\", \"While her husband pointed toward the property, Mrs. Vecino asked, \\u201cHow would you build a house there?\\u201d \\u2014 a question that was echoed by the rest of the family. They found out the answer after they purchased the land, considered four designs and chose the most unusual one, from GilBartolome Architects.\", \"\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t sure, of course. When we saw that house I said, \\u2018My God, this is not going to fall, really?\\u2019 \\u201d she said. \\u201cI was scared.\\u201d\", \"They began to build in 2012, before they had children, and for four years spent summers and off-season weekends there. Their full-time house is just five minutes from the beach, but she says it\\u2019s not the same as life on the cliff.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s as if you\\u2019re far away from everything, in a bubble, in your own world,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s magic. It\\u2019s like the sea is just for you because it\\u2019s not just a bit of it, it\\u2019s an immensity. The sky as well. It\\u2019s everything.\\u201d\", \"They enjoyed the isolation when they wanted to have loud parties. After having three young children, though, the family decided to use the very non-childproof house just for weekends and rent it as a vacation home for about $600 a night in the summer and about $350 in winter, so others can experience it.\", \"The House on the Cliff is striking, but it has competition. Laertis-Antonios Ando Vassiliou, principal architect and director of LAAV Architects, who grew up with a view of the sea in Greece, creates designs for even more daring projects to fit the kind of clientele who might like to live on the edge.\", \"\\u201cI think you need to be a little bit of a daredevil,\\u201d he said.\", \"Potential buyers have tracked him down for his designs, such as the Casa Brutale concept, renderings of which went viral in 2015 \\u2014 and for good reason: it\\u2019s a home that doesn\\u2019t sit on a cliff but in it, like a drawer in a dresser, with a pool for a ceiling and glass windows flush with the rock face.\", \"Alex Demirdjian, chief executive of Demco Properties in Lebanon, wanted to make the house a reality in Beirut. When Mr. Vassiliou partnered with Arup Group to lead the engineering, he found himself in a meeting with structural and mechanical engineers, where he asked, \\u201cIs this possible? Is it feasible?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWell, what\\u2019s the budget?\\u201d asked one of the engineers. \\u201cIf there is a budget, everything is possible.\\u201d\", \"The budget in 2016 was equivalent to about $3.25 million today. Cliff homes present obvious challenges that can be costly to overcome. \\u201cThey have erosion, they have landslides, so they are tricky,\\u201d said Mr. Vassiliou. \\u201cBut of course, from the standpoint of science and engineering, there are many solutions.\\u201d\", \"Even someone with the budget for it has to find the perfect location, a quest that has taken Mr. Vassiliou around the world. Geotechnical tests, which extract a core sample from the rock, have shown several spots to be untenable.\", \"\\u201cThe best rocks are the ones that are pure stone,\\u201d said Mr. Vassiliou, adding that the most stable is igneous rock, such as granite or basalt.\", \"And it matters just as much what\\u2019s above the location as it does what\\u2019s below it. In Lebanon, Mr. Vassiliou initially found what seemed like a great cliff, but more cliffs rose above it, presenting the risk of tumbling stones.\", \"Because of these difficulties, broader sociopolitical issues and the pandemic, the project remains to be realized.\", \"Cliff houses don\\u2019t always have to be such grand affairs. Marialena Hatzigeorgiou and her husband, Daniel Braig, who live in Virginia, just finished their first summer in their new cliff house, one of two simple houses they planned for the future of their two sons, each about 800 square feet and costing about $200 to $300 per square foot to build. They built on the Greek island of Skopelos, on property which had been in her family for decades, but used to be home only to grapes, olive trees and hens.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re not really big houses, but they\\u2019re just perfect,\\u201d Mrs. Hatzigeorgiou said. \\u201cThe view is just breathtaking. It would make you stop doing whatever you\\u2019re doing to just sit there and look at the water.\\u201d\", \"They still met challenges. To get permission to pave an access road, they had to go to court and show World War II-era photos of a mule path that proved the area had been used for entrance even back then. When they built the house in 2018, they chose to forgo testing the cliff, because the family had owned the property for so long and not seen any shifting, even after pouring a foundation and basement back in 2012.\", \"\\u201cThere is a house just a couple of corners around us, and we feel that if it\\u2019s doing well, we are doing OK,\\u201d Mrs. Hatzigeorgiou said, adding that they routed rainwater with erosion in mind, would insure the house soon and will get it tested if they see any changes. \", \"\\u201cFor the time being, I\\u2019m not really worried about it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"d176b63d3e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d176b63d3e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}},
