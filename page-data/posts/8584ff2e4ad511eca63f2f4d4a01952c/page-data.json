Around 9 p.m., boxes of Camp Fire mints, believed to be Candy\\u2019s, were found strewn along a road.\", \"Candy disappeared on March 6, 1959. Over the next 16 days, thousands of people searched for her. The effort included Marines, airmen and military aircraft, but also residents on foot and horseback. An Air Force helicopter involved in the search crashed, killing three crew members.\", \"On the final weekend of the search, 1,200 people turned out.\", \"On March 21, 1959, two off-duty airmen hunting in the woods about seven miles from her house noticed a pair of children\\u2019s shoes. The next morning, the police returned to the area and found Candy\\u2019s body. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled with a piece of her own clothing.\", \"The crime rocked Spokane. Hundreds of tips poured in but none led to Candy\\u2019s killer, frustrating detectives who investigated the case decade after decade.\", \"\\u201cI keep saying it\\u2019s the Mount Everest of our cold cases \\u2014 the one that we could never seem to overcome, but at the same time nobody ever forgot,\\u201d said Sgt. Zac Storment of the Spokane Police Department.\", \"On Friday, more than 62 years after Candy was killed, the Spokane police announced that they had solved the case with DNA evidence and old-fashioned detective work.\", \"The department identified the suspect as John Reigh Hoff, who died by suicide in 1970, when he was 31. His daughter provided a DNA sample that linked her father to semen that had been found on Candy\\u2019s clothing, which had been preserved as evidence in an era long before the advent of genetic testing at crime scenes.\", \"Mr. Hoff, who was buried in the same cemetery as Candy, was later exhumed, and a DNA sample taken from his remains confirmed it was his semen, the police said.\", \"While the identification brought some relief to Candy\\u2019s few surviving relatives, Sergeant Storment said that it was agonizing to have to tell Mr. Hoff\\u2019s widow and four children that Mr. Hoff was responsible for such a heinous crime.\", \"\\u201cI took those people\\u2019s lives and their childhood and dumped it on its head,\\u201d he said at a news conference on Friday. \\u201cWhat they believed about their father and their growing up has been forever changed.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Hoff grew up in Spokane and had a record of petty juvenile crime. He joined the Army when he was 17 and served in Korea as an inventory clerk. He was 20 and lived about a mile away from Candy when she was killed in 1959.\", \"In 1961, he was convicted of grabbing a woman, undressing her, tying her up with her own clothes and strangling her before fleeing, the police said. She survived, and Mr. Hoff served six months in jail, the police said.\", \"As a result of the conviction, Mr. Hoff was declared a deserter and discharged from the Army, the police said. He sold cutlery and worked in a lumber yard and a meatpacking plant, where he suffered a chemical burn on his face.\", \"It was not clear if Mr. Hoff knew Candy, Sergeant Storment said, although they had at least one connection: Mr. Hoff\\u2019s stepsister, who was 10, was a Camp Fire Girl who served as Candy\\u2019s \\u201cbig sister\\u201d in the program.\", \"Sergeant Storment said he had recently spoken to the stepsister, now in her 70s, who recalled sitting next to Mr. Hoff, crying and telling him how she distraught she was at Candy\\u2019s death.\", \"Mr. Hoff\\u2019s daughter, Cathie, said she felt disbelief, anger and sadness to learn that her father had been identified as the suspect. She was 9 when he died.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s just really sad to find out that someone \\u2014 not even just your dad, but just someone in your family \\u2014 could do something like that,\\u201d she said in a videotaped interview with the Spokane police, which identified her only by her first name.\", \"Cathie said she had lived most of her life thinking her father died by suicide because he was depressed.\", \"\\u201cAnd now I think, no, he was evil,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t an escape, in a way, from it, but he got to die with people thinking he was an upstanding man. And he wasn\\u2019t.\\u201d\", \"A cousin of Candy\\u2019s, who was interviewed in the police video, said: \\u201cI feel like Candy\\u2019s loss was just a horrible loss. She was so cute. And she didn\\u2019t have much time.\\u201d\", \"Another relative, identified only as Cheryl, spoke of Candy\\u2019s parents and grandparents, saying: \\u201cI think it\\u2019s really sad that they passed away with not knowing who had taken their granddaughter\\u2019s and daughter\\u2019s life.\\u201d\", \"After Mr. Hoff\\u2019s body was exhumed from the cemetery where Candy had also been buried, his family had him reburied in a different cemetery.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m very, very sorry for what my dad did, that he took her life, horribly,\\u201d Cathie, Mr. Hoff\\u2019s daughter, said in the videotaped interview. \\u201cI hope that it gives her peace knowing that, even though it\\u2019s not really justice because he doesn\\u2019t get any punishment, but that his name has this on it now. And they can know it\\u2019s solved.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8584ff2e4ad511eca63f2f4d4a01952c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8584ff2e4ad511eca63f2f4d4a01952c"}},
