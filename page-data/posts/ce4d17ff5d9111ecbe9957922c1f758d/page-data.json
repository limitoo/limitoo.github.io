We do not, after all, describe movies with time jumps as a collection of short films. Perhaps we should. We could dispense with the \\u201c15 seconds earlier\\u201d chyrons forever.\", \"Why does this distinction matter? Adams\\u2019s protagonist, Kate Bishop, makes the case herself: \\u201cAny story can be happy or sad, I think, depending on where you begin it and where it ends.\\u201d The stories in \\u201cYou Never Get It Back\\u201d are all about Kate\\u2019s life; her family and friends, her work, her sorrows, her bliss. While each episode is somewhat discrete, this carefully curated collection forms a greater and more satisfying whole than the sum of its happy and sad parts.\", \"The title of Adams\\u2019s collection comes from Hemingway\\u2019s \\u201cHills Like White Elephants,\\u201d a tale beloved by M.F.A. courses everywhere. Indeed, Kate\\u2019s world is much confined to the halls and residencies where the business of academia, at first scientific and later creative, is conducted. This restriction could be limiting \\u2014 this is not Jennifer Egan\\u2019s freewheeling \\u201cA Visit From the Goon Squad,\\u201d nor is Kate Bishop as overtly compelling as the title character of Elizabeth Strout\\u2019s \\u201cOlive Kitteridge\\u201d \\u2014 but Adams succeeds in capturing the microcosm of a young woman\\u2019s ordinary struggle in modern America, and it turns out to be pretty devastating.\", \"There is a casual brutality in the manner with which Adams carves out Kate\\u2019s progression from student angst to adult crises. Adams decorates the chapters with the pleasing frivolities we expect to see in the daily activities of a somewhat privileged 20-something. \\u201cArt isn\\u2019t about prettiness, I know, but the world needs some prettiness,\\u201d Kate says, and the pleasures of friendship, dating, parties and travel intersperse the world of growing up and family and work. Still, the fun isn\\u2019t all that it seems; Kate\\u2019s friends are selfish, her boyfriends abusive.\", \"In the title story, one party in particular ends in the worst possible way. A prematurely disillusioned Kate decides she will not report her assault: \\u201cThat was for people who had given up, not for her. She would be better. She would be better than that.\\u201d Adams presents a society that measures a woman\\u2019s value by how much damage she can conceal, how little attention she can attract.\", \"Work and family are also problematic. Kate\\u2019s writing career, once embarked upon, is fragile, and her parents\\u2019 troubles cast long shadows. Adams portrays the dysfunctional family undramatically, their divorce and depression a fait accompli. Kate tries to escape the entropy by embracing passivity: \\u201cIf I held my breath, time would not pass and I would not age and the things that mattered to me would not fall away. But we can\\u2019t save ourselves.\\u201d\", \"This sense of things ending before they have begun suffuses the book with a sadness only slightly leavened by sensuous descriptions of an Arizona evening, or the scent of a New England sweater. Kate\\u2019s world is burdened with grief. A pair of faded postcards from her missing father become the remaining tokens of his affection; a lifetime of love and hope and despair in 4 by 6 inches.\", \"Still, a collection that starts with a Gogol-styled story called \\u201cI Met Loss the Other Day\\u201d refuses to shy away from the absurdity of life\\u2019s privations. \\u201cWhat does she mean when she says, \\u2018You never get it back?\\u2019\\u201d a young man in Kate\\u2019s English class asks when discussing \\u201cHills Like White Elephants.\\u201d \\u201cShe hasn\\u2019t even lost anything.\\u201d Through Kate\\u2019s particular losses, Cara Blue Adams does a fine job of showing the impossibility of innocence in a world that doesn\\u2019t recognize your worth.\"]","href_hash":"ce4d17ff5d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ce4d17ff5d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}},
