But how will it all work?","country":"au","create_time":"2021-11-13T22:51:28.000Z","content":"[\"COVID-19 is coming to Western Australia.\", \"For two years, Premier Mark McGowan has done anything possible to keep coronavirus out of his West Australian fortress \\u2014 shutting borders and implementing lockdowns to \\\"crush and kill the virus\\\".\", \"Now, his state is preparing to open its doors to the world for the first time since the start of the pandemic.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5fce37f066bfea12ac70972c890fc530\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The Premier says requiring a\\u00a090 per cent vaccination rate before reopening will save around 200 lives.(ABC News: Rhiannon Shine)</div>\", \"According to some critics it is far too late, given the rest of the country is re-emerging much sooner, but the WA government insists its cautious opening path will save lives and protect a strong economy.\", \"So, how will it all work?\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">When will WA open?</div>\", \"It's the biggest question, but it still isn't totally clear.\", \"Mr McGowan's plan is to set a date once 80 per cent of West Australians aged 12 and over are fully vaccinated, giving a timeframe that would allow enough time to reach 90 per cent coverage.\", \"The Premier says\\u00a0once a date has been set, it will not change. So that might mean WA actually opens before the 90 per cent threshold, perhaps even not far past 80 per cent.\", \"But the state's sluggish vaccine rollout is still some way short of either of those targets, with WA only having passed the 65 per cent threshold this week.\", \"Ninety per cent is a lofty target\\u00a0too. Only a tiny number of countries have even neared that figure.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/98ee3e5b3455d148c52a2cb26b0c31d9\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

date will be selected in December before WA brings down its borders in late January or early February.\", \"WA is planning to reopen to states with COVID and the rest of the world at the same time.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Will travel then be back to normal?</div>\", \"No. Travel is going to remain much more complex than the simplicity of the pre-COVID world.\", \"<img

will still be locked out of WA.(AAP: Richard Wainwright)</div>\", \"It will be especially restricted for the unvaccinated.\", \"Arrivals from interstate who aren't double dosed will be banned from entering, unless they're under 12 or have a medical exemption, while unvaccinated Australians will be allowed to return from overseas but will have to spend two weeks in hotel quarantine.\", \"For the vaccinated, things will be much more relaxed \\u2014 but not quite the way they used to be.\", \"They will need to test negative within 72 hours of travelling to WA, present proof of their vaccination and then be tested again on arrival.\", \"For those hoping to venture overseas, there'll also be plenty of hoops to jump through in other countries, with many nations requiring proof of vaccination and negative tests for foreign visitors.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">So, will the virus strike WA?</div>\", \"Soon enough, yes.\", \"While the vaccine is incredibly effective at preventing serious illness, it does not completely eliminate the risk of people transmitting and spreading the virus.\", \"Inevitably, some of the people travelling from interstate and overseas without having to quarantine will have the virus and inadvertently spread it.\", \"Because of that, within a year, the WA government is forecasting there will have been 43,108 symptomatic cases of the virus in the community \\u2014 peaking at 338 in a single day.\", \"Over a year, the modelling predicts there being 937 hospital admissions, while 106 people will require intensive care treatment and 117 people will die.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What will that mean for everyday life?</div>\", \"Some restrictions will come back when borders reopen.\", \"<img

public transport, once WA's borders open.(ABC News: Benjamin Gubana)</div>\", \"Masks will be required in high-risk public settings, including on public transport and in hospitals and aged care homes.\", \"Proof of vaccination will also be required to attend nightclubs, the casino and events with more than 1,000 people.\", \"There could also be regional travel restrictions, with the low vaccine coverage of the Indigenous population in parts of the state's north significantly worrying health authorities.\", \"And the government has also left the door open to additional restrictions, particularly if WA is not at 90 per cent vaccination coverage when it opens.\", \"\\\"Depending on the nature of the outbreak, relevant public health and social measures may be temporarily scaled up, in a targeted way, if necessary, to slow the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the impact,\\\" the government said.\", \"\\\"Stricter measures could be introduced at any point where community transmission is deemed unacceptably high.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Will the health system cope with an outbreak?</div>\", \"Plenty of medical groups are worried it will not.\", \"WA's hospitals are already showing signs of enormous strain, most notably with ambulance ramping sitting at unprecedented levels.\", \"To address that strain, the government is planning to open an extra 270 hospital beds and employ an extra 418 nurses and 180 doctors.\", \"All up, it will cost $398 million, with most of the beds to be added to existing public hospitals\\u00a0while 36 will be leased from private facilities.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What happens in the meantime?</div>\", \"For now, WA's aim remains to keep the virus out.\", \"That means the state could still enter lockdown if COVID-19 creeps back in, with the government indicating that remains the case until it chooses to open borders.\", \"<img

quarantine-free travel with COVID hotspots before the end of the year.\", \"Because of that, WA is likely to close its borders to those states before
