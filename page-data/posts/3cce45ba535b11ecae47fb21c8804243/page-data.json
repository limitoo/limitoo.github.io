But as the popularity of traveling by bike has soared during the pandemic, Citi Bike has struggled to keep up with demand.\", \"Some riders in high-use neighborhoods complain that they can\\u2019t find a slot to return their bikes because docking stations are full. Others find empty stations when they need a bike.\", \"Christiane Bussgen said she was late to her job at a furniture showroom recently after pedaling up to six docking stations, all full. She gave up and took her bike into her office.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s awful,\\u2019\\u2019 she said.\", \"Since it started in Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn in 2013, Citi Bike, operated by Lyft, has grown from 6,000 bikes and 12,000 parking docks to about 24,000 bikes and 47,000 docks. The program, which has spread to every borough except Staten Island, is by far the largest bike-sharing system in the country.\", \"But that growth has collided with the intense competition for space in New York\\u2019s congested streetscape, which intensified during the pandemic as the city created open streets, expanded its bike-lane network and made room for outdoor dining.\", \"Increased ridership and unpredictable commuting patterns during the pandemic have made it hard to distribute bikes and docks evenly, Citi Bike has said. Now, faced with the challenge of meeting the demand, the bike-share company and the city Department of Transportation are planning to add 8,000 more docks and 4,000 more bikes by the end of next year, largely in Manhattan, but also in parts of Queens and Brooklyn. In all, the aim is to have a total of 75,000 docks and 40,000 bikes by the end of 2024.\", \"More than 4 million people \\u2014 nearly half the city\\u2019s population \\u2014 live outside Citi Bike\\u2019s Manhattan-centric service area, a fact that triggers frequent criticism of the privately funded program. In a report released Wednesday, the New York City Department of Transportation suggested the city should consider a government subsidy to help the program grow into underserved neighborhoods.\", \"\\u201cCiti Bike is booming, and we\\u2019re thrilled to work closely with Lyft to expand the system,\\u201d said Hank Gutman, the city\\u2019s transportation commissioner. \\u201cWe are moving quickly to nearly double dock availability in the busiest core of the network to ensure our bike-share program continues to be a success.\\u201d\", \"Bike-share programs are thriving in major cities across the country. In Boston, the program started with about 1,000 bikes and now has 4,000. In San Francisco, a system that started with 700 bikes in 2013 now has 4,500, and during the same period a program in Chicago has grown from 750 bikes to 11,500.\", \"\\u201cThe larger bike-share systems are extremely heavily used,\\u201d said Alex Engel, a spokesman for the National Association of City Transportation Officials.\", \"In New York, and across the country, bicycle sales spiked during the pandemic as Americans changed their commuting, leisure and fitness habits. Research from New York City\\u2019s Transportation Department showed a 33 percent jump in bicycle trips from May to December 2020, compared with the same time period the year before.\", \"And that increase isn\\u2019t showing signs of slowing down.\", \"Through Nov. 17, Citi Bike had recorded 25.2 million rides, four million more than in all of 2019, and in September the program recorded its highest monthly tally of 3.3 million rides.\", \"But as the city has sought to accommodate the surge in both bike-share use and overall cycling by adding hundreds of miles of bike lanes, it has provoked a backlash from drivers and some elected officials who complain that parking and driving are now more difficult.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s been a trend to eliminate parking spots for passenger vehicles when they\\u2019ve imposed all these bike lanes all over the city,\\u201d said Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Democrat from Queens who notes that his district does not have easy access to public transit.\", \"And in some neighborhoods, residents complain that cyclists have become a menace.\", \"\\u201cFor old people like me, I\\u2019m having issues because it\\u2019s really scary,\\u201d said Malu Huacuja, 60, a writer, who lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know where to look at, and while you are looking at one rider, there is another one breaking another rule. I am in danger all the time.\\u201d\", \"And, she added, if she says something to reckless cyclists, including some who ignore red lights or ride on sidewalks, the responses are not kind. \\u201c\\u2018It\\u2019s your fault\\u2019 or \\u2018Sorry, grandma\\u2019 or they just insult me,\\u201d Ms. Huacuja said.\", \"Still, it seems clear that New York will emerge from the pandemic as a city where biking has become a vital source of transportation, a development that advocates say needs to be encouraged to fight climate change by keeping more cars off the road.\", \"The city already has about 1,400 miles of bike lanes, making it the largest urban network in the country. Of that, about 569 miles are protected lanes, with barriers that physically separate cyclists from vehicles. This year, the city says it plans to add another 55 miles of bike lanes, 30 of which would be protected lanes.\", \"But advocates say the city needs to move more quickly to find ways to make streets safer during a year when traffic deaths have increased significantly.\", \"\\u201cAmid New York City\\u2019s bike boom, we\\u2019re still traveling from vigil to vigil instead of groundbreaking to groundbreaking,\\u201d said Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group. \\u201cOur leaders must immediately build connected and protected bike infrastructure and reimagine our streets as a pathway to recovery.\\u201d\", \"Eric Adams, a Democrat who is to become mayor in January, has vowed to promote cycling and build 300 miles of protected bike lanes in four years. Mr. Adams, an avid cyclist who used Citi Bike to travel to a news conference during the mayoral campaign, has suggested introducing other bike-sharing companies in places that Citi Bike does not serve.\", \"Citi Bike officials say they are pushing to make the program more robust and to broaden its reach.\", \"\\u201cA majority of New Yorkers agree with prioritizing this use of curb space,\\u201d said Laura Fox, Citi Bike\\u2019s general manager, in an email. The challenge, she said, came from a \\u201cvocal few\\u201d with competing interests, such as preserving parking spaces, who pose a threat to the program\\u2019s success. \", \"Jeffrey LeFrancois, the executive director of a business improvement group in the Meatpacking district in downtown Manhattan, said the pandemic had provided the city with an opportunity to be more ambitious about ensuring that bicycling becomes a key pillar of its transportation network.\", \"\\u201cI think that we are sort of at a real moment of exciting opportunity to be bold as it relates to bike infrastructure,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat certainly is good for the quality of life of New Yorkers and getting people to and from business districts in an efficient way.\\u201d\", \"Some riders just wish the infrastructure was more efficient right now.\", \"Dina Vovsi, 34, a theater director who lives in Brooklyn, has had to return a Citi Bike far from her home because there were no available docks closer.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve had those nights where it\\u2019s so cold and late and I just want to be inside with my dog eating ice cream, and I\\u2019ve had to park more than a mile away,\\u201d she said.\", \"Sarah Martell, a medical student at New York University who uses Citi Bike to commute from her home in Brooklyn, said she is constantly running into full bike racks when she needs to dock or empty ones when she needs a bike.\", \"\\u201cIt happens all the time,\\u201d Ms. Martell, 29, said.\"]","href_hash":"3cce45ba535b11ecae47fb21c8804243"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3cce45ba535b11ecae47fb21c8804243"}},
