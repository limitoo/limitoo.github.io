AT DISNEY WORLD,\\\" she said in the post which was shared to Twitter by Jennifer Adcock (JenKatWrites). \\\"DW is for CHILDREN!!!! People without CHILDREN need to be BANNED!!!!\\\"\", \"That same year, the New York Post ran an op-ed on the subject, which stated: \\\"Millennials are indeed in an unhealthy relationship with Disney, having granted control of so much of their leisure time and personality to a single, enormous corporate entity meant for children.\\\"\", \"Of course, many \\\"Disney Adults\\\" have gone on record to defend their love of the company and its parks.\", \"\\\"I think it's odd that people watch NASCAR races or hunt or fish, but I'm not going to complain to them about it,\\\" Disney annual pass holder Melanie Pati told the Tampa Bay Times.\", \"\\\"Personally, I don't ride Dumbo or It's a Small World, but I would be hell-bent to go on Haunted Mansion.

Your sister is a gigantic a**hole. If she wants her kids to experience Disney, she can take them whenever she wants. To tell her kids about Disney with you is emotional abuse. She's terrible,\\\" commented u/NUT-me-SHELL.\", \"\\\"NTA, you're not obligated to take her kids with you any time you go on vacation, especially when it's a romantic vacation with your GF. This is plain entitlement. She thinks she can control you. When you don't comply with her wishes she disparages you and says that it's ridiculous that you go there as adults, alongside other unprompted insults,\\\" added u/Compensate1995.\", \"Another Redditor wrote: \\\"NTA. Your sister is being ridiculous. Loads of adults go there without kids. Pretty mean of her to put you on the spot like that. Especially dragging her kids into.

It doesn't matter if you are planning to propose, or if you just want some grown-up time, or if you're 18 or 100. You have every right to go to Disney when you want and with whomever you want.
