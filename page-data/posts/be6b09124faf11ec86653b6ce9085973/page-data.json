That\\u2019s not to say that his poignant duets, skittery patter songs and ambivalent tributes to old Broadway can\\u2019t deliver thrills even out of context. Here are 10 videos that show why, in mourning his loss, performers and writers are expressing thanks for his genius.\", \"Jake Gyllenhaal\\u2019s turn in the title role of \\u201cSunday in the Park With George\\u201d was meant to last three concert performances, but the response was so glowing that what started as a 2016 Encores! fund-raiser was retooled for Broadway. This backstage rendition of \\u201cFinishing the Hat,\\u201d a lament for the artistic struggle, shows why.\", \"Judy Kuhn starred as the lovesick Fosca in the Classic Stage Company\\u2019s 2013 revival of \\u201cPassion,\\u201d one of Sondheim\\u2019s most austere, yet romantic scores. Among those who have covered this aching ballad are Barbra Streisand and Barbara Cook; Kuhn is onstage now at the same theater, playing Sara Jane Moore in Sondheim\\u2019s \\u201cAssassins.\\u201d\", \"Sondheim\\u2019s 80th birthday was marked in an all-star tribute with the New York Philharmonic, in which Patti LuPone ripped into \\u201cThe Ladies Who Lunch,\\u201d the boozy \\u201cCompany\\u201d showstopper she is performing on Broadway in the revival now in previews. (Elaine Stritch, who introduced the song in the original production, was there, watchfully watching; she gave her all to \\u201cI\\u2019m Still Here\\u201d from \\u201cFollies.\\u201d)\", \"While the composer\\u2019s 90th birthday fell in the middle of the pandemic, a Zoom tribute still managed to hit the heights, no higher than when Audra McDonald, Meryl Streep and Christine Baranski knocked back the vodka stingers to \\u201cdrink to that.\\u201d\", \"A spate of stripped-down revivals have brought new life and young fans to the Sondheim songbook. Here Patrick Mulryan, playing Jack (of Beanstalk fame) in the Fiasco Theater\\u2019s 2014 \\u201cInto the Woods,\\u201d sings the plaintive \\u201cGiants in the Sky.\\u201d\", \"Yvonne DeCarlo originated this showbiz survivor\\u2019s anthem in \\u201cFollies\\u201d on Broadway 50 years ago, and Ann Miller, Polly Bergen and Shirley MacLaine (onscreen in \\u201cPostcards From the Edge\\u201d) have done it, too. Tracie Bennett got the plum assignment in the National Theater\\u2019s lush 2017 revival; its director, Dominic Cooke, is on tap to make the very-long-awaited movie.\", \"The middle-aged former showgirl Sally Durant sings this \\u201cFollies\\u201d classic, but Jeremy Jordan proves this ballad of obsessive love and lifelong regret is truly universal.\", \"Sondheim\\u2019s one true pop hit, thanks to Judy Collins, has become a full-fledged American songbook standard, thanks to Judi Dench and other performers who\\u2019ve gotten under the skin of the rueful actress Desiree Armfeldt in \\u201cA Little Night Music.\\u201d\", \"This duet between the murderous Mrs. Lovett and her young charge Tobias offers the rare glimpse of unadulterated affection in \\u201cSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,\\u201d though it turns out to be short-lived. Melissa Errico keeps things uplifting in this lilting track from her much-praised \\u201cSondheim Sublime\\u201d album.\", \"Singing from home, earbuds and all, can\\u2019t dampen the emotion of this unforgettable \\u201cSunday in the Park With George\\u201d duet between the artist Georges Seurat and his mistress (and model) Dot, played on Broadway by Jake Gyllenhaal and Annaleigh Ashford.\"]","href_hash":"be6b09124faf11ec86653b6ce9085973"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"be6b09124faf11ec86653b6ce9085973"}},
