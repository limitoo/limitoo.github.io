The four swapped bars, breaks and occasionally expressions of wonderment, like they couldn\\u2019t believe they were \\u2014 to borrow a title from Marsalis\\u2019s own repertoire \\u2014 in this house, on this morning.\", \"The occasion: the kickoff to Jazz at Lincoln Center\\u2019s 34th concert season \\u2014 and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra\\u2019s first indoor New York City performance since the Covid-19 shutdowns. The season will include a tribute to Chick Corea, who died in February; a celebration of the centennial of Charles Mingus; and three concerts showcasing extraordinary women singers, Dianne Reeves, Catherine Russell and C\\u00e9cile McLorin Salvant.\", \"Excitement about the reopening pulsed through the band. \\u201cTo look at and see our audience, and to feel that energy, I\\u2019m going to be overwhelmed,\\u201d said Ted Nash, a saxophonist and composer. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been doing all this virtual stuff, but to create together a sound field and an energy field in person, where all the sounds meld together \\u2014 this is why I do this.\\u201d\", \"Marsalis was quick to say he didn\\u2019t name this weekend\\u2019s concerts \\u2014 \\u201cWynton at 60\\u201d \\u2014 which celebrate his new status as a sexagenarian with a program of his originals from four decades.\", \"Still, despite a warm, even gentle demeanor, there was no doubt he was in charge, announcing the order of soloists at rehearsal, or small tweaks to the charts. But when a soloist occasionally asked how to approach a section, he replied, \\u201cJust do what you all want.\\u201d Or, \\u201cIt\\u2019s you playing it.\\u201d\", \"Freedom within a structure, of course, separates Jazz at Lincoln Center from other major performing arts institutions with a repertoire. So does Marsalis\\u2019s tradition of inviting young musicians to play on its biggest stage, the Rose Theater in the Columbus Circle complex.\", \"\\u201cIt shows the generations working together,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhen we started the orchestra, surviving members of Duke Ellington\\u2019s orchestra played. Marcus Belgrave played with Ray Charles. Sir Roland Hanna played with the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Orchestra. Jerry Dodgion and Frank Wess played with Basie. They passed on a lot of the feeling of the music and its identity and meaning to us. So, this is a continuation.\\u201d\", \"Chris Crenshaw, a trombonist, composer and arranger who has been in the orchestra since 2006, said, \\u201cWe have a charge to keep. We have a responsibility. There\\u2019s so many things in all traditions that have been passed down from generation to generation orally or with music.\\u201d\", \"The responsibilities that come with serving as the artistic director and public face of a major arts organization has meant that, for Marsalis, the shutdown was never truly a shutdown. He pulled out his phone and thumbed through dozens of photos of score pages for upcoming projects (a tuba concerto, a bassoon piece).\", \"Versions of the band have toured the United States and the world, taking endless Covid-19 tests and often playing music from his politically engaged \\u201cThe Democracy! Suite,\\u201d which boasts song titles like \\u201cSloganize, Patronize, Realize, Revolutionize (Black Lives Matters).\\u201d Streaming concerts, from the vault and some fresh, have abounded and will continue \\u2014 this season, any concert can be streamed for a donation of $10.\", \"The work helps distract from the losses that have mounted since March 2020, including Marsalis\\u2019s musician father, Ellis, and his friend and mentor, the critic Stanley Crouch, in addition to more musicians than any institution could fully memorialize. \\u201cI tend not to dwell,\\u201d he said. \\u201cMy dad, he said \\u2018Everybody\\u2019s losing people. And when you focus too much on yours \\u2026\\u2019\\u201d He let that thought drift away and then recalled something the pianist John Lewis once said to him. \\u201c\\u2018To focus too much on even something negative is a form of deep ego.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYou got to keep moving forward, keep being productive and trying to create the world you envision,\\u201d Marsalis added.\", \"At 60, Marsalis, who won a Pulitzer in 1997 for \\u201cBlood on the Fields,\\u201d his oratorio about slavery, sees a world in which democracy itself is imperiled, and \\u201cthe intellectual class still always wants the Black man to be a fool on all levels.\\u201d His humanism, though, buoys him. \\u201cYou can subvert the Constitution and make it harder for people to vote, make it more difficult for government to work,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut there\\u2019s always voices that defend the integrity of the document, which is changeable \\u2014 it\\u2019s not set in stone.\\u201d\", \"He shifted quickly back to the subject upon which he has most often stirred controversy. \\u201cMusic is the same. You can be glib enough to undermine the integrity of it and be successful. But there\\u2019s always just enough voices who believe in the integrity of it.\\u201d\", \"Those young trumpeters, in his estimation, count among those voices. Jazz at Lincoln Center\\u2019s mission has always focused on jazz education and advocacy, and the guest artists at \\u201cWynton at 60\\u201d \\u2014 Summer Camargo, Giveton Gelin, Tatum Greenblatt and Anthony Hervey \\u2014 demonstrate the power of that outreach.\", \"Camargo caught Marsalis\\u2019s attention when her South Florida high school placed in the institution\\u2019s annual \\u201cEssentially Ellington\\u201d contest, which invites school bands to record themselves playing free Duke Ellington charts and then brings the finalists to New York City to perform. Now a Juilliard student, Camargo said she never would have attempted composition without the impetus of the contest, where, in 2018, she won awards for composing as well as for soloing.\", \"\\u201cWhen people ask me what was one of the best days of your life, I always go back to that moment,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWynton took me backstage and gave me compliments and advice. He doesn\\u2019t sugarcoat it \\u2014 he tells you what you need to do to get better.\\u201d\", \"Gelin, a recent Juilliard graduate who self-released his debut album, also praised Marsalis\\u2019s generosity as a mentor \\u2014 and his practical advice. Visiting New York from the Bahamas during his high school years, Gelin attended a free Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra concert in Queens and afterward worked his way through the line to meet Marsalis. The next day, Gelin played for him at his home and was surprised that so famous a figure invested such energy in urging a kid to dig deeper into developing his own voice.\", \"\\u201cI spent a lot of time in the Haitian church,\\u201d Gelin said. \\u201cOne of the first things Wynton said to me was to listen closely to the singers there and how their vocal qualities reflect where they\\u2019re from.\\u201d\", \"Marsalis nodded when reminded of this encounter. \\u201cYour sound will be organic when who you are doesn\\u2019t fight with who you want to be,\\u201d he said.\", \"On opening night Thursday, the four up-and-comers got their shot onstage. The orchestra\\u2019s 90-minute set surveyed some of Marsalis\\u2019s most crowd-pleasing compositions, including big-band stompers, ballads and percolating curios marked by his fondness for musical onomatopoeia, with muted horns aping the buzz of bees and the keening of train whistles.\", \"The 15-member ensemble tackled \\u201cThe Holy Ghost,\\u201d from Marsalis\\u2019s \\u201cAbyssinian Mass,\\u201d and he delivered a bracing, unamplified solo on a quartet treatment of Gordon Jenkins\\u2019s \\u201cGoodbye\\u201d that he dedicated \\u201cto all the people who have lost someone and didn\\u2019t get to tell them goodbye.\\u201d\", \"But the most boisterous crowd response came soon after those young trumpeters took the stage. Camargo\\u2019s gutsy opening solo brought patrons to their feet and inspired Marsalis \\u2014 her hero \\u2014 to muse afterward, \\u201cShe ain\\u2019t playing around at all.\\u201d\", \"The four ringers\\u2019 joyous clamor brought the house down. Marsalis called their presence \\u201ca birthday present to myself,\\u201d but their performances suggested it\\u2019s not just a gift for him.\"]","href_hash":"a692c21e495e11ec991ff3390fb7c2b9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a692c21e495e11ec991ff3390fb7c2b9"}},
