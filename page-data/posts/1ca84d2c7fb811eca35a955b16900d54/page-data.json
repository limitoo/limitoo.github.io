Using archival footage, clips from Cosby\\u2019s comedy albums, talking-head interviews and testimony from several of his more than 50 accusers, Bell begins to unpack Cosby\\u2019s complicated cultural standing. Or, as he puts it, \\u201cWhat do we do about everything we knew about Bill Cosby and what we know now?\\u201d\", \"\\u2018The Afterparty\\u2019When to Watch: Beginning Friday, on AppleTV+.\", \"\\u201cNothing can ruin this night!\\u201d a man says of his 15-year high school reunion.

You decide!)\", \"But the casting department has outdone itself, with an ensemble that includes Tiffany Haddish as the lead investigator, alongside Zo\\u00eb Chao, John Early, Dave Franco, Ilana Glazer and Sam Richardson.

Do insects taste nice?) His investigations are not especially rigorous. But his enthusiasm feels genuine. And his hair?
