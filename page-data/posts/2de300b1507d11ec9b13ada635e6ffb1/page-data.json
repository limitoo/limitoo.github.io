The latest figures suggest at least 4.4 million people living in Australia (about 17.7 per cent of the population) have some form of disability. However, if all other factors \\u2014 such as age, location and education level \\u2014 remain constant, people with a disability have a lower standard of living, or \\\"require higher income to maintain the same living standard as those without a disability\\\".\\u00a0\", \"A study published last year found that in the short term, \\\"people with a disability need to increase their adult-equivalent disposable income by 50 per cent to achieve the same standard of living as those without a disability\\\". In the long run, the average cost associated with disability was equivalent to 63 per cent of disposable income.\\u00a0\", \"With average house prices in Australia estimated to be more than six times greater than annual incomes \\u2014 and eight times incomes in Sydney\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0diminished disposable income also significantly diminishes purchasing power.\\u00a0\", \"According to Dr Michael Palmer, an economist at the University of Western Australia, people with disabilities are more likely to have health conditions that require specialised health care, rehabilitation and drugs.\", \"Higher electricity costs including increased heating and cooling due to having limited mobility at home, specialised transportation and dietary requirements can add to this. Meanwhile, assistive devices like wheelchairs can cost tens of thousands of dollars.\\u00a0\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/89229e406a5a068a7e6c91d267144901\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Without\\u00a0financial support from governments, people with disabilities\\u00a0will continue experiencing a\\u00a0lower standard of living compared to those in the broader community, says Michael Palmer.(Supplied)</div>\", \"And while some government support is available in Australia, it often doesn't cover all the costs associated with disability.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Many people with disability also need to access therapies and supports which are not fully costed under either the NDIS or schemes such as the Medicare Better Access schemes,\\\" says Smith-Merry.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Having to choose between housing and healthcare</div>\", \"For me, these figures ring true. I have a musculoskeletal disorder which, according to the ABS, is the most common type of disability reported. While I am grateful to receive subsidised access to medication and several sessions of physiotherapy and exercise physiology each year through Medicare, I generally use these services on a weekly basis, so the vast majority is not covered.\\u00a0\", \"The cost of these services is one of my most significant expenses, accounting for 30-50 per cent of my weekly budget, often ahead of other \\\"essentials\\\" such as rent or food.\", \"With house prices rapidly rising, I worry about how my inability to save and pay a mortgage now could affect my longer-term health and financial security. I also worry about what would happen if I found myself unable to work in the future: How would I cover my rent?\", \"These costs can hit families particularly hard. Linda*, who requested her real name not be used to protect her family's privacy, says she struggles every day with the cost of essential services for her children, who have neurological disabilities and specific language disorder. The speech and occupational therapy they need costs more than $500 each month\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0and they are not eligible for any support under the NDIS, as they've been classified as having only \\\"mild\\\" disabilities.\\u00a0\", \"Then there's the additional burden of getting to and from their appointments \\u2014 an hour away from where Linda lives in regional NSW.\\u00a0\", \"Although it has been recommended that Linda's children attend therapy weekly, she says the rising costs of living mean her family just \\\"can't afford\\\" it.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Tackling a big problem with inclusive solutions</div>\", \"So, what's being done to fix these problems? Tackling housing affordability issues appears to be a high priority for federal and state governments. The NSW Government, for instance, has identified housing affordability as one of the key \\\"pillars\\\" to be addressed in the state budget.\\u00a0\", \"However, in developing new initiatives, experts warn policy makers must consider ways to improve housing affordability for everyone \\u2014\\u00a0including people with disabilities.\\u00a0\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f2691146a7b5c50a5866282d3f89e834\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Stable housing can help ensure people with disabilities can access the supports they need to live the life they want, says Jennifer Smith-Merry.(Supplied: University of Sydney)</div>\", \"For Jennifer Smith-Merry, one way of improving housing affordability for people with a disability would be through an employment strategy focusing on reducing under-employment and increasing wages. In Australia, people with a disability are nearly twice as likely to be unemployed as those without one, and Australia's disability employment rate is far lower than other OECD countries.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Our current strategy is not working very well because it looks to employers for action, but whether they act [to hire people with disabilities] or not is up to them,\\\" Smith-Merry says. \\\"With high levels of stigma towards some people with disability, to really raise the level of disability employment the government may need to look towards things such as a Disability Job Guarantee and other forms of job creation programs.\\\"\", \"Increasing the accessibility and range of subsidised disability services under schemes like the NDIS and Medicare would also likely reduce the cost of living with disability.\", \"\\\"Without strong financial support by governments, households with members with disabilities will continue to experience a lower standard of living compared to otherwise similar households without disability,\\\" says Michael Palmer.\", \"More specific strategies to help people with disabilities purchase homes could also have a positive impact. For example, a disability home buyer guarantee, modelled off first home buyer schemes or the First Home Super Scheme \\u2014\\u00a0similar to a program that exists in Canada\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0could help people build up a\\u00a0deposit.\\u00a0\", \"But while getting together a deposit can be \\\"tricky\\\", Smith-Merry says it's also important that people have \\\"enough money\\\" to pay their mortgage. And for too many, this will unfortunately remain unachievable until the prohibitive costs associated with having a disability are addressed.\", \"\\\"Stable housing is essential for physical security and for having a stable base so that people with disabilities can access the supports that they need to live the life that they want,\\\" she says.\", \"The ABC is partnering with\\u00a0International Day of People with Disability\\u00a0to celebrate the 4.4 million Australians with disability.\"]","href_hash":"2de300b1507d11ec9b13ada635e6ffb1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2de300b1507d11ec9b13ada635e6ffb1"}},
