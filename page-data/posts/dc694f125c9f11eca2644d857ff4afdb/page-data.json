For their leaders, this poses a quandary: How can they impose yet more restrictions on a fragile, exhausted populace after so much forced separation?\", \"Yet the Omicron variant is a dismal reminder that the Covid era is far from over, dragging on like plagues of old. Health authorities in Denmark and Norway yesterday warned of a sharp increase in Omicron cases, predicting that the new variant will soon dominate both countries. England had already reported similar findings.\", \"In the U.S., Covid has now been responsible for almost 800,000 deaths. One in every 100 Americans ages 65 or older has died from the virus. For people younger than 65, that ratio is closer to 1 in 1,400. The total number of known coronavirus cases in the U.S. yesterday surpassed 50 million.\", \"Quotable: \\u201cI know it will only get worse, it won\\u2019t stop, the pandemic will only turn more life-consuming,\\u201d said Natalia Shishkova, a teacher in Moscow. \\u201cIt is all chaos, like a fantasy film. You watch all these apocalypse films and realize their writers were real prophets.\\u201d\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"A global wave of inflation is changing the political terrain for the right-wing populists leading countries like Turkey, Brazil and Hungary who have enjoyed wide support for years. Instead of the hot-button cultural issues that once stirred the electorate, voters are now primarily focused on the economy.\", \"Prices are climbing faster than they have in almost two decades in Brazil, a country with a relatively recent history of disastrous inflationary episodes. In Turkey, the unorthodox economic policies of its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have set off a full-on currency crisis. And in Hungary, voters are most concerned with the cost of living and low wages.\", \"As the global economy began to heal from the pandemic this year, a combination of supply chain disruptions, central bank money-printing and government stimulus spending ignited a sharp rise in prices around the world. That prompted leaders in many developing countries to tweak their policies \\u2014 and global investors to rethink their investments in those markets.\", \"Related: Workers in Europe are increasingly demanding wages that keep up with inflation, which last month reached 4.9 percent.\", \"Boris Johnson, the tousle-haired British prime minister, faces the most difficult stretch of his leadership yet: a threat of mutiny from his rebellious Conservative Party; collapsing poll ratings; and persistent questions about whether he or his staff flouted the very lockdown rules they imposed on the public by hosting a Christmas party last year.\", \"The cascade of bad news is so extreme that it has raised questions about whether Johnson will even hang on to power until the next election. It is an ominous turn for a leader who has long defied political gravity, surviving scandals and setbacks that would have sunk many other politicians.\", \"With no general election likely for at least two years, Johnson is not under immediate threat from voters. But if Conservative lawmakers feel it would be politically expedient, they can eject him through an internal leadership vote or a vote of no confidence. For the first time, political analysts and party members said, such a challenge seems plausible.\", \"Analysis: \\u201cIt\\u2019s not the end for him, but I think it\\u2019s the beginning of the end,\\u201d said Jonathan Powell, who served as chief of staff to a Labour prime minister, Tony Blair. \\u201cThe problem is that these crises have a cumulative effect. As soon as he ceases to be an asset and the party is facing an election, they\\u2019ll get rid of him.\\u201d\", \"By the numbers: Johnson\\u2019s rating has plummeted to 24 percent approval and 59 percent disapproval, the lowest of his tenure, according to a recent poll. The opposition Labour Party now leads the Conservatives by nine percentage points, its largest advantage since February 2014.\", \"The raid, in the Indian city of Ahmedabad, came just after sunset. Plainclothes municipal workers swarmed into a busy neighborhood, seizing contraband as dealers scattered or watched helplessly. It was yet another successful crackdown on eggs.\", \"The place of the humble egg \\u2014 and other animal products \\u2014 has become the latest flashpoint in the growing role of religion in everyday life under Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister.\", \"These 193 stories show the reality of climate change in every country in the world.\", \"For the Golden Globes, the show must go on, even when there\\u2019s no show. NBC said it would not air next year\\u2019s ceremony because of ethical failings by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the scandal-ridden group behind the awards. Yet the H.F.P.A. has announced its list of nominees all the same \\u2014 one only marginally more diverse than in previous years.\", \"Some background: A series of bombshell reports in The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times revealed financial and ethical lapses within a cloistered membership with zero Black voters. Though the H.F.P.A has since claimed to be cleaning up its act, what little reforms it has made came only after a lot of heel-dragging and half measures.\", \"While the group\\u2019s president, Helen Hoehne, projected positivity in her remarks yesterday, it remains unclear what form the Jan. 9 ceremony will take, especially after a rival awards show, the Critics Choice Awards, swooped in to claim the date for its own televised ceremony.\", \"The best director category this year made room for two women, Jane Campion (\\u201cThe Power of the Dog\\u201d) and Maggie Gyllenhaal (\\u201cThe Lost Daughter\\u201d), and the race for best actor in a drama featured three Black contenders, Will Smith (\\u201cKing Richard\\u201d), Denzel Washington (\\u201cThe Tragedy of Macbeth\\u201d) and Mahershala Ali (\\u201cSwan Song\\u201d).\", \"On the drama side, \\u201cThe Power of the Dog,\\u201d \\u201cKing Richard\\u201d and \\u201cBelfast\\u201d dominated, while in the comedy-musical categories, significant attention was showered on \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d \\u201cLicorice Pizza\\u201d and \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up.\\u201d\", \"Read the full list of Golden Globe nominations.\", \"You won\\u2019t miss the meat in this vegan Bolognese.\", \"Transport yourself to the slopes of Mount Etna, in northeastern Sicily, where farmers have cultivated lush olive groves for millenniums.\", \"\\u201cA Natural History of the Future,\\u201d by Rob Dunn, reminds us that we live on nature\\u2019s terms.\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: patriarch of the Roy family on \\u201cSuccession\\u201d (five letters).\", \"And here is the Spelling Bee.\", \"You can find all our puzzles here.\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing.
