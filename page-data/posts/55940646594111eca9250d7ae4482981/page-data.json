Their neighbors keep voting for Democrats, and some of them are even protesting the police at regular intervals. The de Blasio mayoralty was one long nightmare of wokeness. Liberals have even taken over the Metropolitan Opera!\", \"The difficult trials have driven a pair of famous conservatives to pen essays about why they are leaving New York.\", \"Karol Markowicz, a writer for The New York Post and Fox News, wrote this week that she and her family were leaving partly because New Yorkers were continuing to wear masks outdoors and require children to wear them at school. \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to Florida, a state we\\u2019ve come to regard as the beacon of freedom in this country,\\u201d she wrote.\", \"Then there\\u2019s Sohrab Ahmari, a contributing editor to The American Conservative, whose description of his near decade spent living in New York just made me sad:\", \"\\u201cNew York City, to my mind, isn\\u2019t a megalopolis made up of five enormous boroughs,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cRather, \\u2018The City\\u2019 is a small rectangle with our apartment at its center. In one direction, its outer boundary touches the News Corp. building, where I used to work until recently; in the other direction, it spans the far side of Queensboro Bridge, which I often run across for exercise, barely landing on Long Island City before I race back over the East River to the familiar comforts of Midtown.\\u201d\", \"Listen, they say that if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. But there are some people who just don\\u2019t have what it takes. New York City is dirty. It\\u2019s loud. Tiny apartments are wildly expensive. The city was hit hard by the pandemic. The national supply chain crisis has led to a cream cheese shortage at bagel shops. (An enduring love affair with bagels is one of a dwindling number of things that can bridge the political divide here.)\", \"But for the sake of diversity \\u2014 as well as the holiday spirit \\u2014 I hope conservatives wobbling on New York will tough it out with the rest of us. The city\\u2019s recovery is an all-hands project, and a good argument makes us smarter. Sometimes, as the novelist Joan Didion wrote in her essay on leaving New York in 1967, Christmas can be a \\u201cdifficult season.\\u201d\", \"Lighting a Christmas tree on fire didn\\u2019t help.\", \"\\u201cTreeson!,\\u201d the front page of The New York Post blared on Thursday. (A replacement Fox News Christmas tree was erected on Thursday evening.)\", \"The original tree was 50 feet high, artificial and festooned with red, white and blue ornaments, a garish mash-up of holiday and patriotic themes. Meghan McCain, who says she doesn\\u2019t live in New York City anymore, seemed to suggest its destruction was yet another sign that the city had let itself go. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to hear anything about how radical some of you believe republicans to be when there are lunatics running around New York City setting Fox News Christmas tree on fire,\\u201d she wrote on Wednesday in a tweet that has since been deleted.\", \"While that isn\\u2019t quite how I would put it, it is true that the next mayor, Eric Adams, will inherit a city still recovering from a pandemic and that has real problems, including crime, homelessness and a mental health crisis. Also, no one should ever light a Christmas tree on fire, even if it was tacky.\"]","href_hash":"55940646594111eca9250d7ae4482981"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"55940646594111eca9250d7ae4482981"}},
