Meryeta Odine of Canada won the bronze.\", \"\\\"That (2006) is a very famous story in snowboardcross and to see her come home with the gold -- it's honestly really cool to see,\\\" O'Dine said, according to the Reuters news service.\", \"That the first U.S. gold would come from Jacobellis and not Shriffin or someone else in the action park - say slopestylers Jamie Anderson or Red Gerard - was surprising. That Jacobellis would put herself in the win column after all these years wasn't a shock at all. \", \"Long after the embarrassment and dismay of her \\\"Lindsey Leap\\\" in 2006, Jacobellis kept on riding, and winning. Since 2007, she's amassed 45 World Cup podiums. Twenty-three of them have been golds, and she had two third-place finishes coming into the Games. \", \"But that silver-medal Olympic performance has followed her, and she's largely chosen to stay out of the spotlight.\", \"At a media opportunity with all the snowboardcross riders last week, Jacobellis stayed back to concentrate on racing, her coach said. \", \"And while Shaun White and Chloe Kim can't take two steps around this snowboard park without getting noticed, Jacobellis walked alone with a member of the U.S. staff a few hours before her final. Nobody even noticed.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"bebc4358898511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bebc4358898511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
