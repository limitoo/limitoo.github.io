The United Nations human rights office has registered about 600 civilian deaths, but the U.N. acknowledges the real toll is certain to be far higher.

Such horrific attacks must stop.

It was one of many strikes to hit the city over the last three weeks.\", \"The governor of the region said Wednesday that electricity had been cut to Chernihiv city and some surrounding towns and villages, but the Reuters news agency quoted Governor Viacheslav Chaus as saying Ukraine's armed forces were dealing \\\"powerful blows on the Russian enemy every hour.\\\"\", \"On Tuesday, Reuters interviewed Mykola Vasylinko in Kyiv, who said he had just fled to the capital from Chernihiv, where the situation was \\\"much worse.\\\"\", \"\\\"This is no Chernihiv,\\\" he told Reuters. \\\"They [Russian forces] have tried to erase [it] from the Earth's surface.
