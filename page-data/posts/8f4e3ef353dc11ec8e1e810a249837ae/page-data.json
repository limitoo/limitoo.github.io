on\\u00a0Friday before qualifying at 4:35pm AEDT.\", \"Saturday features another couple of practice sessions before the always dramatic top 10 shootout at 5:05pm AEDT.\", \"Then, on Sunday, this year's Great Race will get underway at the latest time ever, 12:15pm AEDT.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How long is Bathurst 1000?</div>\", \"The race is exactly as advertised, 1,000 kilometres of flat-out racing around the iconic 6.213km course.\", \"That's 161 laps of intense racing, which often features\\u00a0plenty of crashes as well as desperately tense\\u00a0tactical battles as teams try to work out pit strategies and conserve their tyres on the hugely demanding, undulating circuit.\", \"How long the actual race goes for depends on a whole host of factors, including the amount of wet
