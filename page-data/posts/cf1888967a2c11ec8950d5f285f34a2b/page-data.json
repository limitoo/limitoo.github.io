No white wine is actually white nor red wine red, yet we accept these phrases.\", \"Alternative descriptors have been proposed for orange wines \\u2014 white wines that are made using red wine techniques. Some would prefer to call them amber wines, while others like skin-contact wines, alluding to the production process rather than the color. Orange seems to have caught on a little better. So here, orange it will be.\", \"But what does it mean to label a wine orange? At Wine School we have been drinking and thinking about orange wines over the course of the last month. As several readers have pointed out, it\\u2019s an enormous and puzzling topic to try to cover in three bottles, as is our usual approach.\", \"\\u201cGreatest strength of orange wines: You have no idea what to expect,\\u201d said VSB of San Francisco. \\u201cGreatest weakness of orange wines: You have no idea what to expect.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhen you buy a Chablis, you have a pretty good idea of what you\\u2019ll get,\\u201d VSB continued. \\u201cAn orange wine? How would you know?\\u201d\", \"VSB was alluding to a quality referred to among wine professionals as typicity, taken from the French word typicit\\u00e9, referring to what one may typically expect from a particular wine like a Chablis. People may have different notions of Chablis\\u2019s typicity, and such arguments occur in wine seemingly every day. But nobody would argue that orange wines have typicity.\", \"\\u201cOrange wines, just like any other \\u2018color\\u2019 of wines, really can\\u2019t be categorized or generalized,\\u201d Jason C. of New York rightly points out.\", \"So why take on such a broad subject?\", \"Our aim at Wine School is to achieve ease through exploration. The more sorts of wine we drink, the more comfortable we are in settling on our own tastes and preferences.\", \"At the same time, we become aware of the extraordinary and precious diversity of the wine world. We may still decide to open a bottle of the brand of sauvignon blanc we\\u2019ve enjoyed for years, but that becomes a decision made with awareness of many options rather than simple force of habit.\", \"With orange wines, we are in a sense starting from scratch. Fifteen years ago, few people had ever heard the term, much less tasted any wines to which it might be applied. Today, intrepid wine drinkers are familiar with orange wines, but many more casual consumers are not.\", \"As a way of introducing the idea of orange wines, I chose three different examples. Unlike the bottles I would ordinarily select, they were not bound by geography or grape. The wines happened to all be Italian, but they came from different regions and were made with different varieties. Rather, the three simply coexist in this broad, unwieldy category.\", \"The three bottles were: Montenidoli Vernaccia di San Gimignano Tradizionale 2019, COS Terre Siciliane Pithos Bianco 2020 and Monastero Suore Cistercensi Lazio Coenobium Ruscum 2019.\", \"What they have in common is a production technique. Each of these white wines, to varying degrees, was made like a red wine. Unlike the typical modern white wine, in which the juice is whisked away from the skins shortly after the grapes are crushed or gently pressed, red wines are permitted to macerate with the skins, which contain pigment and tannins.\", \"That\\u2019s how orange wines are made. Juice from the white grapes macerates with the skins as with red wines, absorbing tannins and pigment depending on the length of the maceration. According to the producers\\u2019 websites, the Montenidoli spent up to a week in contact with the skins, not long at all in the context of orange wines, where some extreme examples spend months mingling with the skins.\", \"The Ruscum stayed on the skins for 15 days and the COS a month. I might have guessed the reverse as the Ruscum was an amber color and the COS reddish but still somewhat pale. They both had distinct tannic rasps, but it\\u2019s hard to fully account for the differences. Other elements play a role, like the vessels in which the wines were fermented and aged. The COS was produced in amphorae and the Ruscum in steel and fiberglass vats.\", \"Given the vast array of variables, it\\u2019s easy to understand VSB\\u2019s consternation. It\\u2019s why ultimately, when the idea of orange wines becomes more familiar, it will pay to narrow down the exploration.\", \"The skin-contact wines of the country of Georgia, for example, which are the expression of a culture many centuries old, have little in common with their counterparts in, say, Northern California, where the idea may have come from a trip overseas or a group text.\", \"I enjoyed all three of these wines. The Montenidoli, made entirely of vernaccia, was sort of an introductory example, the closest to a conventional white wine, with just a hint of color. But it did have discernible, if gentle, tannins, felt in its fine sandpapery texture. It tasted to me of dried flowers and orange zest.\", \"The COS was made of grecanico, as garganega, the grape of Soave, is known in Sicily. I found it exceedingly fresh and energetic, floral and almost meadowy in its breezy fragrance. Compared with the Montenidoli, it was quite a bit more tannic.\", \"So was the amber Ruscum, which was a blend of four grapes: trebbiano, malvasia, verdicchio and grechetto. It was herbal, spicy and peppery, with flavors of cloves and citrus zest. It seemed less fresh but equally delicious.\", \"The Ruscum, by the way, is produced at a convent by Cistercian nuns, who in addition to vineyards have orchards and gardens, which they farm organically. They also sell products like jam, beer and chocolates.\", \"I would say the reception for these wines was mixed. Some people, like Peter of Philadelphia, found the Montenidoli and COS not all that different from conventional white wines. Peter also tried an orange wine from Georgia, a Tevza Goruli Mtsvane, which spends five months or so in contact with the skins in qvevri, the traditional Georgian amphoralike vessel that is made of clay and buried in the earth. He found it far more unusual and captivating than the other two.\", \"Frankly, I would love to devote a month in Wine School to drinking such Georgian wines. Sadly, they would be too difficult to find in many parts of the country. Nonetheless I would urge anybody who\\u2019s interested to explore these fascinating wines.\", \"Though Peter found the COS unsurprising, it\\u2019s often thought to be on the transgressive side. Olga Mosso of Germany recalled visiting a restaurant in Sicily where the owner warned her that the COS was a very different sort of wine that some people found odd. She ordered it nonetheless and loved it.\", \"Several people like VSB and Dan Barron of New York were perplexed by which foods to serve with these wines.\", \"\\u201cI want a wine that wraps its boozy arms around my food and says, \\u2018You and me, kiddo,\\u2019 \\u201d said Dan, an exacting judge of pairings who found the orange wines wanting. Ferd T. Elvin of Montreal suggested some Persian dishes, which I think would have gone brilliantly with these wines.\", \"I\\u2019m generally happy with good food and good wine together, regardless of fireworks. Schuyler Schultz of San Diego, described one sort of combination \\u201cwhere the food and wine harmoniously coexist and have a pleasant conversation with one another.\\u201d That came close to describing my reaction to drinking these wines with an olive-walnut pasta.\", \"Fiona Beckett, whose website Matching Food and Wine examines such matters, offers some general recommendations for orange wines, though, to reiterate Jason C.\\u2019s point, it\\u2019s difficult to speak broadly about this genre.\", \"John M. of Philadelphia said, \\u201cI find orange wines hit or miss.\\u201d This is true and can be said about any type of wine in the world. No wine is a sure thing if you have no experience with it. That\\u2019s why some people, fearing disappointment, prefer to buy the same wine over and over, just as they may order the same dish at a particular restaurant. Others prefer to explore, trying new and different wines. Discoveries only come with exploration.\", \"I hope this introduction whets the appetite for further examination. I don\\u2019t drink orange wines frequently, but I have some that I love and others that did not move me. Yet I often find them compelling, particularly the more emphatic examples.\", \"I know, though, that these wines are not for everyone. That\\u2019s as it should be. For some it will be one and done. For others, it may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
