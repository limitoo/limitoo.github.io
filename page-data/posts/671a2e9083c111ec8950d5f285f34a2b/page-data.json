The cut would cause further coastal inundation.\\\"\", \"Due to a lack of ground height between the Orowaiti and the sea, the cut had to be shallow and wide in order to provide any flood relief benefit, in the right scenarios. It also required approximately one million cubic metres of material to be moved.\", \"Beal said that the Orowaiti Cut presented its own issues. It was not likely to significantly self-flush due to lack of river velocity and the distance of well over a kilometre involved.\", \"\\\"We want to reassure the community, that if doing the cut would provide flood relief for the event we are facing then we would be acting.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/126561/eight_col_car.jpg?1626580256\\\" alt=\\\"Effects of the flooding in Westport, two days later.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nFile photo: Car surrounded by water during Westport's flooding in July. \\nPhoto: Supplied / NZ Defence Force\\n</div>\", \"Beal said he understood it was a stressful time for the Westport community and the council was looking at all options that could be immediately deployed.\", \"\\\"Using the flood modelling undertaken, we have been able to recommend priority areas for sand-bagging to be done today.\\\"\", \"The Buller District Council has coordinated supplies for sandbags. These can be accessed at the Pulse Recreation Centre car park by the netball courts, and at the Kawatiri Coastal Trail by the Buller Bridge.\", \"The Orowaiti cut is one of the flood protection tools being considered by the Westport Steering Committee as part of an application for Government funding.\"]","href_hash":"671a2e9083c111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"671a2e9083c111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
