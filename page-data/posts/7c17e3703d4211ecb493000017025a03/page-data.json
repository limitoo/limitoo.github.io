God'. ","country":"au","create_time":"2021-11-04T07:40:47.000Z","content":"[\"A Perth mother and grandmother have avoided being sent to jail for planning\\u00a0the genital mutilation of a newborn baby girl.\", \"The 23 year-old-woman had given birth to the child two weeks earlier\\u00a0and, in January this year, she and her mother, who was aged 50 at that time, went to a doctor in the Perth suburb of Canning Vale seeking female circumcision.\", \"In order to protect the identity of the child, the ABC has chosen not to name the women.\\u00a0\", \"The District Court of WA was told the grandmother, who was described as \\\"extremely persistent\\\", wanted the procedure done\\u00a0straight away and\\u00a0when the doctor refused, she offered to pay cash.\", \"State Prosecutor\\u00a0Danielle Clarke\\u00a0said the doctor managed to convince the women there was a problem with Medicare and so they left the practice.\", \"Their actions were reported to the authorities after the father of the child became aware of what the women were planning.\", \"They both pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to unlawfully perform female genital mutilation.\", \"The court was told\\u00a0that, since being charged, neither of them had been able to have any contact with the child.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Women sought 'lowest level' of genital mutilation</div>\", \"The grandmother's lawyer, Richard Lawson, told the court the procedure his client was seeking was the lowest level of genital mutilation, as ranked by the World Health Organisation.\", \"He said it is less invasive than the other levels\\u00a0and that his client, who was of Malaysian heritage, and her daughter, had had the procedure\\u00a0performed on them.\", \"\\\"[The child]\\u00a0would be pricked and blood drawn.\\\"\", \"He accepted that the grandmother had known the practice was illegal in Australia\\u00a0but, he said, she thought if they went to a Malaysian doctor, no one would know what happened.\", \"Mr Lawson said his client, who has since undergone cultural awareness counselling, was deeply remorseful and now regretted her actions.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">First-time mum was trying to be the 'perfect mother'</div>\", \"The mother's lawyer, Alana Taylor, said her client had agreed to consult a medical practitioner as part of a \\\"desire to appease others\\\".\", \"\\\"There were underlying threats of going to hell if she wasn't following the religious notion,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"Ms Taylor said the woman was also facing the challenges of having her first child.\", \"The court was told\\u00a0she had also since undergone counselling and was fully educated and understood the procedure and the complications associated with it.\", \"She had also not been able to have any contact with her daughter\\u00a0which, Ms Taylor submitted, was already punishment for what she had done.\", \"<img

with the baby.\\u00a0(ABC News: Herlyn Kaur)</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Judge says cultural beliefs put ahead of child's welfare</div>\", \"Judge Alan Troy described the women's actions \\\"a gross breach of trust\\\", saying they had both known what they were seeking was illegal.\", \"\\\"Having had the enormous blessing of a healthy daughter and grand-daughter, your apparent priority was to mutilate her genitals,\\\" he told the women.\", \"He said the abhorrent nature of the procedure was outlined in reports by the World Health Organisation, which regarded it as a violation of the rights of girls and women.\", \"\\\"You cannot regard this practice as a 'gift to God'.\\\"\", \"He said the grandmother's persistence during the doctor's consultation aggravated her offending.\", \"Judge Troy accepted the younger woman was in a vulnerable position because she had just given birth but\\u00a0said she had put her mother's beliefs ahead\\u00a0of her own daughter's welfare.\", \"The court was told the women are considered a low risk of re-offending and Judge Troy accepted the child was now \\\"safe\\\" from them.\", \"He imposed a 15-month suspended jail term on the grandmother and a 12-month suspended term on her daughter.\", \"Judge Troy also ordered that they be supervised in the community and undergo any counselling or treatment that is deemed appropriate.\", \"Outside the court, Mr Lawson said his client had now \\\"learned her lesson\\\".\", \"\\\"She thought it was a cultural thing she could undertake but, fortunately, it's not in Australia.\\\"\", \"He also said neither women had intended to harm the child.\"]","href_hash":"7c17e3703d4211ecb493000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7c17e3703d4211ecb493000017025a03"}},
