Once all of the trays have a protein, they are covered, bagged and boxed. Then the meals, about 300 in all, are refrigerated overnight, ready to be delivered to New Jersey residents the next day.\", \"MadeMeals is one of hundreds of restaurants and meal delivery services across New Jersey that are paid by local nonprofit organizations through a new state program called Sustain and Serve. The program has granted millions of dollars to nonprofit organizations to partner with restaurants to feed New Jersey residents who struggle to have food on a regular basis.\", \"The program is seen as \\u201cwin-win-win\\u201d for nonprofit organizations, residents who are food insecure and small businesses that may be struggling during the coronavirus pandemic.\", \"\\u201cThis is definitely something I\\u2019m passionate about, which is to be a business that makes profit, but also has a way to give back to the community and make an impact,\\u201d said Jesse McBride, the owner of MadeMeals.\", \"So far, $34 million has been awarded to 29 organizations in the state to partner with restaurants and meal delivery services. Gov. Phil Murphy announced another $10 million for the program this month.\", \"The New Jersey Economic Development Authority, which rolled out the program last November, said the nonprofit organizations were receiving $100,000 to $2 million each to purchase meals from eligible restaurants, which are then delivered free to New Jersey residents.\", \"\\u201cAll of the restaurants have to have 50 or fewer employees, so that we can really target our focus on small businesses,\\u201d said Tara Colton, executive vice president of economic security at the agency. She said the program was on track to serve 3.5 million meals by the end of January.\", \"MadeMeals is paid by Coalition for Food and Health Equity, a nonprofit organization that was awarded $1.2 million to serve weekly meals to around 400 people who are eligible for its meal subscription service, the Hunger Project.\", \"\\u201cThe majority of those that we serve are seniors over the age of 65, homeless individuals and persons with disabilities,\\u201d said Leeja Carter, the nonprofit\\u2019s founder and executive director.\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t just do kind of blanket meals,\\u201d Dr. Carter said. \\u201cIf someone has a peanut allergy, or if they have a particular medical condition, then we customize those meals for their particular needs.\\u201d\", \"The Sustain and Serve program was created as another element to combating food insecurity in New Jersey.\", \"\\u201cFood insecurity in New Jersey was an enormous issue before Covid and it\\u2019s only worsened,\\u201d Ms. Colton said. \\u201cAnd in many cases, hunger has really been hiding in plain sight.\\u201d\", \"Before the onset of the pandemic, around 700,000 people in New Jersey were food insecure, said Carlos Rodriguez, president of the Community FoodBank of New Jersey, one of the state\\u2019s biggest food banks. It projected in a September 2020 report that as many as 1.2 million people would struggle to have food on a regular basis during the height of the pandemic last year.\", \"\\u201cNow, no less than around 800,000 people are food insecure,\\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said.\", \"Mr. Rodriguez said meaningful employment and an affordable cost of living for all were ways to help eliminate food insecurity in the state.\", \"\\u201cWe need to make sure that families get the financial access that they need to be able to shop and have access to food,\\u201d he said, \\u201cso people don\\u2019t wind up trading off rent for food.\\u201d\", \"The Foundation for University Hospital in Newark received more than $1 million through the program. It provides the hospital\\u2019s patients and their caregivers with meal tickets to use to get free meals from nearby restaurants.\", \"Jess Backofen, executive director of the foundation, said it was not unusual for people to come into the emergency room and then be referred to the hospital\\u2019s social work team, because doctors determined they might not have a medical issue but were seeking shelter or food.\", \"\\u201cThey want to almost get admitted so that they can get fed,\\u201d she said. \\u201cNow we\\u2019re able to give them a meal, and really avoid backing up the emergency department for someone who doesn\\u2019t need medical attention.\\u201d\", \"A wide range of factors contribute to the high number of food insecure people in the state, and experts said common perceptions about who was actually struggling with reliable access to food were misleading.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s so much deeper than just being homeless,\\u201d said Niki Graham, the manager of community engagement at Rescue Mission of Trenton, an organization that helps people get back on their feet by providing shelter and through programs like vocational development and addictions treatment counseling.\", \"\\u201cWe recently opened a food pantry in late July to speak to this need, because you have families, you have students who need regular meals,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not just someone who doesn\\u2019t have a place to live.\\u201d\", \"Rescue Mission received $200,000 from the Sustain and Serve program and has partnered with local restaurants to serve three free hot meals to more than 100 people daily.\", \"\\u201cJust imagine someone who\\u2019s been down on their luck or homeless or been in the prison system, and hasn\\u2019t had restaurant food in God knows how long,\\u201d Ms. Graham said. \\u201cThen you have this program that allows you to support local restaurants that were on the verge of closing, and also feed homeless people chicken Marsala.\\u201d\", \"Michele DeLury, 54, has been living in the shelter at Rescue Mission since December, she said, after a legal situation forced her out of her home. As she tries to get back on her feet, she said she appreciated all that the shelter has done, including supplying people like her with \\u201cquality\\u201d food.\", \"\\u201cThis is not my home, but having the three meals a day makes tackling the days a little easier,\\u201d she said.\", \"The meals program was also designed to help struggling restaurants keep their doors open through the pandemic.\", \"Dana Lancellotti, president and chief executive of the New Jersey Restaurant and Hospitality Association, said that 20 months into the pandemic, restaurants were still facing challenges, like labor shortages and supply chain issues, but initiatives like Sustain and Serve were helping many places keep their doors open.\", \"\\u201cThere are people who have come back that we didn\\u2019t know they would be able to,\\u201d she said of the businesses that Sustain and Serve had been able to help. \\u201cThat was all unpredictable.\\u201d\", \"Jenny Leon, owner of the Spanish and Italian fusion restaurant Trentini\\u2019s, said the program saved her from shutting her doors permanently. The restaurant, which is also in Trenton, partnered with the Rescue Mission.\", \"When Trentini\\u2019s opened in 2002, Ms. Leon ran it alongside her brother. When he died seven years ago, Ms. Leon started feeling as if she was fighting to stay open.\", \"\\u201cI was actually working by myself,\\u201d she said, referring to the early days of the pandemic. \\u201cIn the front, the back, taking calls, cleaning, doing all this stuff because I couldn\\u2019t pay anyone. My kids came and helped me.\\u201d\", \"With the money the restaurant earned through the meals program, Ms. Leon said she was able to bring back 12 employees.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m so grateful for that,\\u201d she said. \\u201cMost of my employees were waiting for that call.\\u201d\", \"She added: \\u201cAfter my brother passed away, this is more than just a business.
