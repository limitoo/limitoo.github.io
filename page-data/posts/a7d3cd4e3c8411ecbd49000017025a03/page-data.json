Stern, whose 1968 film \\u201cRachel, Rachel,\\u201d was directed by Newman and starred his wife, Joanne Woodward, spent several years interviewing people from all corners of Newman\\u2019s life, including his children, his ex-wife Jacqueline Witte, close friends, and actors and directors who worked with him. This produced thousands of pages of transcripts and convinced Newman he should do his own version. Stern peppered him with questions, Gethers said, and they created recordings that are a mix of interview and Newman speaking without prompts.\", \"The recordings, completed about 10 years before his death, describe Newman\\u2019s early life, including his difficult relationship with his parents, as well as his troubles with drinking, his shortcomings as a husband in his first marriage, and his flaws as a parent. It is candid about his sorrow when his son, Scott, died of a drug and alcohol overdose at 28.\", \"The book also delves into Newman\\u2019s insecurity in his younger years, exploring his jealousy of peers like James Dean and Marlon Brando when they were all working in Hollywood.\", \"\\u201cHe said that his mother did not so much think of him as flesh and blood, but as a decoration,\\u201d Gethers said. \\u201cHe says that if he was not a pretty child, she never would have paid attention to him at all. It\\u2019s a devastating thing to read, and clearly forms so much of his life and his insecurity about being an actor.\\u201d\", \"The memoir will also cover his marriage to Woodward, which Gethers called \\u201cremarkably loving, affectionate and sexy,\\u201d as well as his acting career and racecar driving.\", \"The book was purchased at auction this spring, Gethers said. It will be about 80 percent memoir, with the remaining part based on the recordings Stern made with people close to Newman. It will also include previously unreleased family photographs.\", \"The transcripts were given to Knopf, which was then charged with turning it into a book. (After the publisher bought it, more transcripts were found in a storage unit in Connecticut, in a banker\\u2019s box marked \\u201cPLN / HISTORY,\\u201d Gethers said.) Stern died in 2015, so Newman\\u2019s daughters are participating in the editing process, in essence as an author would, approving changes and drafts.\", \"Gethers himself is the author of 13 books and several screenplays, and has produced movies and television shows. He said that while wooing the Newman family during the bidding process, he told them that his father, a TV writer and producer, wrote one of Newman\\u2019s earliest starring roles in 1956 on a show called \\u201cRag Jungle.\\u201d Gethers also mentioned that he had two cats named for Newman roles: Harper and Hud.\"]","href_hash":"a7d3cd4e3c8411ecbd49000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a7d3cd4e3c8411ecbd49000017025a03"}},
