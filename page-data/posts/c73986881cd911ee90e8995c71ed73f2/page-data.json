It reached an all-time high in 2022, with everything from iPhones to solar panels and soybeans creating an eye-watering $700 billion in trade.\", \" At that level, the economic ties are crucial to both countries, and as Yellen told the second-most powerful man in China on Friday afternoon, they need protecting.\\u00a0\", \"She defended \\\"targeted actions\\\" taken by the U.S., a reference to limits on the export of some advanced processor chips and other high-tech goods to China, saying they were necessary for national security reasons.\", \"\\\"You may disagree,\\\" she told Chinese Premier Li Qiang. \\\"But we should not allow any disagreement to lead to misunderstandings that needlessly worsen our bilateral economic and financial relationships.\\\"\", \"China's Finance Ministry said in a statement Friday that it hoped the U.S. would take \\\"concrete actions\\\" to improve the two countries' economic and trade ties going forward, stressing that there would be \\\"no winners\\\" in a trade war or from the two massive economies \\\"decoupling.\\\"\", \"Li, who had met Yellen previously, seemed to be in a receptive mood, telling Yellen in welcoming remarks that a rainbow had appeared as her plane landed from the U.S., and \\\"there is more to China-U.S. relations than just wind and rain. We will surely see more rainbows.\\\"\", \"The goal of Yellen's trip is to pave the way for more bilateral talks, but she has a tough message to deliver, too: That the U.S. is not prepared to soften its stance on some of the things the Chinese are most angry about, including the controls on the sale of sophisticated U.S. technology to China. \\u00a0\", \"Elizabeth Palmer has been a CBS News correspondent since August 2000.
