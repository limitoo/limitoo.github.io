Federal authorities had indicated that unvaccinated players might be able to enter Australia and compete in the tournament in Melbourne after a 14-day quarantine period. But Daniel Andrews, the premier of the state of Victoria, has been adamant that players will need to be fully vaccinated, just as Australian Open spectators and on-site employees will be required to be vaccinated.\", \"Melbourne, the capital of Victoria, has experienced some of the strictest coronavirus measures in the world, with six separate stay-at-home orders over an 18-month period.\", \"\\u201cIt is the one direction that you can take that you can ensure everyone\\u2019s safety, and all the playing group understands it,\\u201d Tiley said of requiring players to be vaccinated. \\u201cOur patrons will need to be vaccinated. All the staff working the Australian Open will need to be vaccinated, but when we\\u2019re in a state where there\\u2019s more than 90 percent of the population fully vaccinated \\u2014 they\\u2019ve done a magnificent job with that \\u2014 it\\u2019s the right thing to do.\\u201d\", \"Steve Simon, the chairman and chief executive of the Women\\u2019s Tennis Association, said in an interview this week that \\u201cover 70 percent\\u201d of the WTA\\u2019s top 300 singles players and top 100 doubles players had been vaccinated and that all the singles and doubles players who competed in the recent WTA finals in Mexico had been vaccinated. Andrea Gaudenzi, chairman of the men\\u2019s tour, said on Friday in an interview that the vaccination rate for the top 100 men\\u2019s singles players was \\u201cabove 80 percent.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe are moving toward 90 percent, 95 percent of fully vaccinated,\\u201d Gaudenzi said. \\u201cA lot will do it in the off-season with one shot.\\u201d\", \"But it seems all but certain that some qualified players will not make the journey to Australia because of the policy.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s an unfortunate situation,\\u201d Gaudenzi said of mandatory vaccination, speaking shortly before the tournament\\u2019s announcement. \\u201cI really hope in the future, in America and after that, there\\u2019s going to be a change: at the minimum, providing exceptions even with a hard quarantine of seven or 14 days, but allowing entry.\\u201d\", \"All four Grand Slam tournaments, including the U.S. Open, allowed unvaccinated players to participate this year, as have regular tour events, including the ATP Finals currently underway in Turin, Italy.\", \"Djokovic, a nine-time Australian Open singles champion, has yet to confirm whether he will defend his title next year. He and his wife, Jelena, contracted the coronavirus in June 2020 during an exhibition tour he had helped to organize in Serbia and Croatia. He has expressed concern about vaccines.\", \"\\u201cHow are we expecting that to solve our problem when this coronavirus is mutating regularly from what I understand?\\u201d he told The New York Times last year.\", \"He has said, repeatedly, that he would wait for the Australian Open\\u2019s policy to be made clear before making a decision on participating.\", \"That moment has come with Djokovic set to play the No. 3-ranked Alexander Zverev of Germany in the semifinals of the Turin tournament on Saturday.\", \"\\u201cHe has always said the Australian Open is the event that puts the wind in his sails,\\u201d Tiley said of Djokovic. \\u201cSo I hope we get to see Novak.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"77e537d249ac11ec8b606d59e375e39b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"77e537d249ac11ec8b606d59e375e39b"}},
