Whatever it was or wasn\\u2019t: one of those crucial moments in a novel that give the reader the chance to exhale. \\u201cLove in the Big City,\\u201d already a best seller in Korea and Park\\u2019s first novel to be translated into English, is intoxicating. Across four parts that follow Young from college to postgraduate life in Seoul to burgeoning literary success, the narrator \\u2014 hard-drinking, hard-feeling and hard-falling \\u2014 recounts the loves that have defined his life thus far. Among them: an enchanting, chain-smoking roommate, Jaehee, who eventually moves out to get married; Young\\u2019s stubborn though increasingly wistful, cancer-stricken mother; a self-loathing activist ex he calls Hyung (Korean for \\u201colder brother\\u201d); and Gyu-ho, whose presence in Young\\u2019s arms and his memory buoys the novel\\u2019s wrenching and rewarding second half, which follows the protagonist into his 30s.\", \"Throughout Young is mired in a pained self-analysis that is exacerbated by his gay identity. \\u201cAn excess of self-awareness was a disease in itself,\\u201d he says. One symptom? His perception of his own mediocrity, describing himself as \\u201cneither particularly attractive nor a complete lost cause, just enough not to embarrass any partner.\\u201d But to the reader, Young is tremendous fun, an international pop music connoisseur who spends his evenings in Seoul making out with strangers and drinking to excess wherever he can find free tequila. He\\u2019s also as temperamental as they come. On one page he calls love \\u201ca brief moment you can escape from only after it turns into the most hideous thing imaginable,\\u201d but later waxes poetic when caught up in its thrall: \\u201cSometimes his very existence to me is the existence of love itself.\\u201d Watching Young drift in and out of such love, always finding something valuable, even life-altering, to hold onto, is one of the book\\u2019s most notable pleasures.\", \"In Park\\u2019s 2019 novella, \\u201cThe Tears of an Unknown Artist, or Zaytun Pasta,\\u201d his narrator reveals, \\u201cI watched every queer flick that opened in Korea out of my natural-born duty as a queer.\\u201d The genre\\u2019s scarcity can be both grievance and gift. While straight stories still dominate shelf space and most spaces beyond, queer readers are conditioned to the hunt. How grateful we should be to find ourselves in a perpetual state of exploration, to be hungry for any and all stories about people who remind us of us. In Park\\u2019s hands, Young is loud and obnoxious, insufferable and magnetic, messy and wise. The prose, translated by Anton Hur, reads like an iPhone screen, vibrant and addictive. What a joy it is to see such a profound exploration of contemporary queer life \\u2014 its traumas and its ecstasies throbbing in harmony. It\\u2019s a shimmering addition to the recent genre of novels chronicling queer millennial malaise.\", \"Park once said in an interview that \\u201clove to me was always the most important problem.\\u201d In exploring that problem through a young man\\u2019s earnest, evolving relationships with family, friends and partners, Park has proved there is no solution. Whatever it was or wasn\\u2019t, \\u201cLove in the Big City\\u201d is dazzling.\"]","href_hash":"e8b3c15246ed11ec9fa3f59ae847dfad"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e8b3c15246ed11ec9fa3f59ae847dfad"}},
