His song \\u201cWay 2 Sexy,\\u201d featuring Future and Young Thug, was up for best rap performance, and \\u201cCertified Lover Boy\\u201d \\u2014 one of the biggest hits of the year \\u2014 was up for best rap album. He was not nominated in any of the top categories, like album, record or song of the year.\", \"But Drake and his managers recently asked that his name be removed from the two rap categories, and the Recording Academy, the organization behind the awards, honored the request, according to representatives for the rapper.\", \"The Recording Academy had no comment, but a page on the Grammys\\u2019 official website, listing changes to the nominations, was updated on Monday noting the removal of Drake\\u2019s two citations.\", \"The news was first reported by Variety.\", \"Drake\\u2019s withdrawal, which emerged just as the final voting period for the awards was opening, is the latest complication for the Grammys. The academy has struggled for years to prevent an exodus among major artists of color, who have made a litany of complaints against the awards, including a poor record of wins for Black artists in the most prestigious categories, as well as a wider failure by the academy and its voters to recognize and appreciate the cultural heft and intricacies of contemporary Black music.\", \"The Recording Academy has also taken steps in recent years to attract a younger and more diverse voting pool and to prove to the music industry that its processes are fair and transparent.\", \"But already this year, the awards have been dogged by questions about what has happened behind the scenes. The day before the nominations were announced last month, the academy\\u2019s board approved a last-minute plan to expand the ballot in the top four categories to 10 slots, from eight. Comparing the final ballot to an early version of its nominations list, which circulated throughout the industry, showed that the beneficiaries included Taylor Swift, Kanye West, Abba and Lil Nas X.\", \"Drake has been nominated for 49 Grammys in his career \\u2014 counting the two nods he got this year \\u2014 and has taken home four. But he has long expressed ambivalence about the awards, even after winning, and has often decided not to attend the ceremony even when he has been widely nominated.\", \"After his streaming smash \\u201cHotline Bling\\u201d won best rap song and best rap/sung performance in 2017, Drake questioned his genre categorization in a radio interview. \\u201c\\u2018Hotline Bling\\u2019 is not a rap song,\\u201d he said at the time. \\u201cMaybe because I\\u2019ve rapped in the past or because I\\u2019m Black, I can\\u2019t figure out why.\\u201d He added of the awards, \\u201cI don\\u2019t even want them, because it just feels weird.\\u201d\", \"In 2019, when Drake and Kendrick Lamar were the two most-nominated artists, each declined invitations to perform on the show. Drake did appear onstage to accept the best rap song award for \\u201cGod\\u2019s Plan,\\u201d but seemed to allude in his speech to the Grammys\\u2019 fraught history in recognizing hip-hop \\u2014 a rocky relationship that dated back to the first-ever rap award in 1989, when some artists boycotted the show because the category was not going to be televised.\", \"\\u201cThis is a business where sometimes it\\u2019s up to a bunch of people that might not understand what a mixed-race kid from Canada has to say or a fly Spanish girl from New York, or a brother from Houston,\\u201d Drake said. \\u201cBut the point is, you\\u2019ve already won if you have people who are singing your songs word for word \\u2014 you don\\u2019t need this right here,\\u201d he added, holding up the Grammy.\", \"But as Drake started to continue speaking, the Grammys cut to commercial. Drake later called his words \\u201ctoo raw for TV.\\u201d A representative for the show said that producers had mistaken a pause in Drake\\u2019s speech for the end.\", \"Earlier this year, before the 63rd annual show, the Weeknd, who had been shut out of the nominations despite his album, \\u201cAfter Hours,\\u201d being one of the biggest hits of 2020, declared that he would boycott the awards in the future to protest its use of anonymous nominations review committees. Those were\\u00a0blue-ribbon industry panels that sorted through voters\\u2019 first-round nomination picks and settled on a final ballot.\", \"The review committees had long been a subject of intrigue in the business. A legal complaint by Deborah Dugan, who became the academy\\u2019s chief executive in 2019 \\u2014 only to be ejected just five months later \\u2014 said that those committees were rife with corruption and conflicts of interest. This year the Recording Academy, led by its new chief, the producer Harvey Mason Jr., eliminated those committees in most categories, though the last-minute rule change has once again put a spotlight on the nominations process.\", \"In response to the perceived snubs of the Weeknd last year, Drake wrote on Instagram that \\u201cwe should stop allowing ourselves to be shocked every year by the disconnect between impactful music and these awards and just accept that what once was the highest form of recognition may no longer matter to the artists that exist now and the ones that come after.\\u201d\", \"He added, \\u201cThis is a great time for somebody to start something new that we can build up over time and pass on to the generations to come.\\u201d\", \"The 64th annual Grammys are scheduled to be held in Los Angeles on Jan. 31.\"]","href_hash":"da60593c577b11ec9e4921f6dab68d9f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"da60593c577b11ec9e4921f6dab68d9f"}},
