Those prices are up 6.2 percent over the last year, and shortages and other inconveniences are side effects of the problem.\", \"Now inflation is also a central political issue. It is dragging down President Biden\\u2019s approval ratings and fueling discontent among Americans. It\\u2019s clear in surveys. It will surely be the talk at the table of Thanksgiving family gatherings next week (even if, as an economics writer, I might prefer to skip one day of talking about supply chain mechanics).\", \"How did we get here? Who is to blame? To help you understand, today I\\u2019ll walk you through the most obvious candidates \\u2014 and where the evidence looks strongest.\", \"Presidents have less control over the economy than headlines might suggest, but the current situation is an exception to the rule. You can draw a direct line from a specific policy decision that Biden and congressional Democrats made this past winter to some of the inflation happening now.\", \"In designing the stimulus that Congress passed in March, Biden\\u2019s administration went big, with $1.9 trillion in pandemic relief \\u2014 on top of a separate $900 billion package that passed three months earlier. Put the two together, and $2.8 trillion in federal money has been coursing through the economy this year while economic activity has trended only a few hundred billion dollars a year short of what mainstream analysts would consider full health.\", \"If you think of inflation as a result of too much money chasing too few goods, then this extra spending is most likely a culprit. \", \"But for all the trillions spent, Americans\\u2019 purchases through the end of September were only about $52 billion higher \\u2014 or 0.4 percent \\u2014 than would have been expected in a world where the pandemic never happened. I take that as evidence that most of the spending served to replace lost incomes (from people not working, voluntarily or otherwise) or was plowed into savings, and the inflation story is more complicated than just too much money floating around.\", \"The nation\\u2019s central bank has kept ultra-easy monetary policy in place for far longer than in past economic cycles. Its chair, Jerome Powell, has focused on returning the job market to full health and has projected that the inflation surge is temporary.\", \"His response in large part took from the lessons of the last economic expansion, when the Fed started raising interest rates at the end of 2015 and, with hindsight, might have excessively crimped a recovery that was only starting to show big benefits to workers.\", \"But Powell and other policymakers might be fighting the last war. At a minimum, the Fed has not played its traditional role of pre-empting an inflation surge by deliberately slowing the economy.\", \"That said, monetary policy takes a long time to affect consumer prices, so it\\u2019s not a given that the inflation situation would be terribly different now if the Fed had started raising rates already. \", \"When the pandemic shut down the world in 2020, operations managers at companies concluded: We need to do whatever we can to survive.\", \"Automakers saw it as a severe recession and cut back production and orders for new supplies, while car rental companies sold their fleets. Airlines canceled orders for new jets. Energy companies canceled drilling projects. Companies in a range of industries laid off workers.\", \"We\\u2019re still dealing with the effects of those decisions. This turned out to be a much shorter economic downturn, with a much speedier recovery, than many people were forecasting in the spring of 2020. So now, automakers are wishing they hadn\\u2019t canceled orders for semiconductors, car rental companies are struggling to add vehicles, shipping prices are through the roof, fuel prices are spiking, and companies are wrestling with labor shortages.\", \"What seemed like prudent, sensible decisions turned out to be wrong for the actual economy we ended up with.\", \"Despite all that, however, supplies of many goods actually are higher than they were before the pandemic. The problem is that demand is up even more.\", \"Though everybody experienced the pandemic differently, in the aggregate a couple things are true.\", \"We shifted our spending toward stuff, rather than services. Americans purchased 18 percent more physical goods \\u2014 cars, washing machines, furniture \\u2014 in September than they did in February 2020, while their consumption of services fell a bit. Because demand for such goods is off-the-charts high while supplies are limited, they are more expensive.\", \"And many of us elected to stop working, or work less. (The number of people working remains smaller than it was prepandemic.) The shortage of workers has led employers to offer higher wages to attract employees. That fuels price increases even in services experiencing underwhelming demand, like restaurant meals.\", \"The great shift in Americans\\u2019 purchasing and employment patterns prompted by the pandemic look like the primary culprit in this bout of inflation. Decisions by Biden and the Fed likely contributed, and earlier decisions in the corporate world made it harder for supply to adjust to match surging demand.\", \"In assessing blame for the wave of inflation, the biggest question is whether policymakers should have foreseen the problems around reopening \\u2014 and perhaps been more restrained in trying to stimulate the economy.\", \"That means the future of inflation depends not just on what happens in Washington, but on what happens with the pandemic \\u2014 and how quickly Americans return to more typical spending patterns and more people go back to work.\", \"How have Republicans made gains with Asian American voters? By focusing on issues they care about, says Jay Caspian Kang.\", \"In the 20th century, liberal democracy beat communism, fascism and nationalism.

First released nearly a decade ago, \\u201cRed\\u201d signified the beginning of Swift\\u2019s transition from country to pop. And among true Swifties, the favorite track was \\u201cAll Too Well,\\u201d an \\u201cachingly rendered portrait of a breakup,\\u201d Lindsay Zoladz writes in The Times. (There is much speculation about the actor rumored to have inspired the song.)\", \"So when Swift debuted the music video for a new 10-minute version of \\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d \\u2014 and performed the entire song on \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d \\u2014 fans went wild. While the shorter version of the song featured \\u201ctaut, streamlined storytelling,\\u201d Zoladz writes, the new version is \\u201cgloriously unruly and viciously seething.\\u201d\", \"Swift began the rerecording project to keep control over her songs, after her first six albums were sold to investors. It is a shrewd business move: The rerecorded songs are outperforming the originals on streaming services, The Wall Street Journal reports.\", \"But the extended cut of \\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d shows how the rerecordings can also enhance the original works. The most striking lyric in the new track highlights the age gap between an older man and a younger woman, and the video emphasizes the point with actors who are more than a decade apart. The result, Zoladz writes, is a young woman\\u2019s attempt to retroactively correct a power imbalance. \\u2014 Sanam Yar, a Morning writer\", \"Turn humble mushrooms into rich, savory morsels.\", \"Plan desserts ahead of time: We have recipes for pies aplenty, as well as non-pie options.\", \"Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak pay tribute to 1970s R&B on \\u201cAn Evening With Silk Sonic.\\u201d\", \"Seth Meyers joked about the differences between Steve Bannon and Logan Roy.\", \"The pangram from yesterday\\u2019s Spelling Bee was cornball.
