The city is now encircled by Russian soldiers, who are slowly squeezing the life out of it, one blast at a time.\", \"Several appeals for humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians went unheeded, until Ukrainian officials said Wednesday that about 30,000 people had fled in convoys of cars. Airstrikes and shells have hit the maternity hospital, the fire department, homes, a church, a field outside a school. For the estimated hundreds of thousands who remain, there is quite simply nowhere to go.\", \"The surrounding roads are mined and the port blocked. Food is running out, and the Russians have stopped humanitarian attempts to bring it in. Electricity is mostly gone and water is sparse, with residents melting snow to drink. Some parents have even left their newborns at the hospital, perhaps hoping to give them a chance at life in the one place with decent electricity and water.\", \"People burn scraps of furniture in makeshift grills to warm their hands in the freezing cold and cook what little food there still is. The grills themselves are built with the one thing in plentiful supply: bricks and shards of metal scattered in the streets from destroyed buildings.\", \"Death is everywhere. Local officials have tallied more than 2,500 deaths in the siege, but many bodies can't be counted because of the endless shelling. They have told families to leave their dead outside in the streets because it's too dangerous to hold funerals.\", \"Many of the deaths documented by the AP were of children and mothers, despite Russia's claims that civilians haven't been attacked. Doctors say they are treating 10 civilians for every injured Ukrainian soldier.\", \"\\\"They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to mock it, to constantly bomb and shell it,\\\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on March 10.\"]","href_hash":"7b7f65a8a55911ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7b7f65a8a55911ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
