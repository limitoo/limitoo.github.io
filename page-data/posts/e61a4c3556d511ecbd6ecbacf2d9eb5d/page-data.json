It makes for an interesting, if challenging, celebratory menu. The wholesale Fulton Fish Market has simplified assembling the essential ingredients, and you do not have to be a chef to gain access since the market has been selling to consumers since 2016. It ships a vast array of seafood to retail customers nationwide, by the portion or by the bundle, including two assortments designed for the seven fishes dinners, serving six to eight. A traditional selection includes baccala, squid, octopus, eel, shrimp, clams and smelts. The other selection more closely follows contemporary tastes with salmon, branzino, halibut, lobster tails, shrimp, scallops and crab meat. You can select your delivery date.\", \"Feast of the Seven Fishes Bundles; traditional, $279.99; modern, $469.99; prices include shipping to continental U.S., fultonfishmarket.com.\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.
