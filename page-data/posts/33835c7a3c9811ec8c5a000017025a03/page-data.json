People. Existed.\\u201d This isn\\u2019t about historical accuracy, or even realism; it\\u2019s about genre. The movie, directed by Jeymes Samuel (from a screenplay he wrote with Boaz Yakin), is a high-style pop Western, with geysers of blood, winks of nasty, knowing humor and an eclectic, joyfully anachronistic soundtrack featuring cuts from Jay-Z, Fela Kuti and Nina Simone alongside Samuel\\u2019s original score.\", \"The point is that the vivid assortment of gunslingers, chanteuses, saloonkeepers and train-robbers \\u2014 all of them Black \\u2014 who ride through picturesque mountain ranges and frontier towns have as authentic a claim on the mythology of the West as their white counterparts. They exist, in other words, as true archetypes in a primal story of revenge, greed, treachery and courage.\", \"Especially revenge. The story begins with a family\\u2019s Sunday dinner interrupted by slaughter. Some years later, the young boy whose parents were gunned down in front of him has grown up into an outlaw named Nat Love, played with abundant charm by Jonathan Majors. Nat\\u2019s gang \\u2014 whose most valuable players are a sharpshooter (Edi Gathegi) and a quick-draw specialist (RJ Cyler) \\u2014 specializes in stealing from other outlaw bands. But that\\u2019s just business. The personal concerns that propel Nate and the plot are his love for Stagecoach Mary (Zazie Beetz) and his vendetta against Rufus Buck (Idris Elba).\", \"Mary is a singer and entrepreneur with impressive fighting skills. Rufus resembles a villain out of fantasy or science fiction \\u2014 a nearly superhuman avatar of evil with grandiose ambitions and a grudge against the universe. And also the charisma of Elba, unmatched at playing bad guys with a touch of sadness to them. Rufus\\u2019s crew is a mirror-image of Nate\\u2019s, though his empire is more extensive. His sharpshooter, Cherokee Bill (Lakieth Stanfield), is a philosophical sociopath, and his main lieutenant is a ruthless killer named Trudy Smith.\", \"Speaking of charisma: Regina King! From her first appearance \\u2014 on horseback, in a blazing blue coat with gold buttons to match her stirrups \\u2014 Trudy spikes the magnetometer, but King is in good company. Just look at the names in the preceding paragraphs. Add Delroy Lindo as a dour U.S. Marshall with complicated allegiances and Danielle Deadwyler as Mary\\u2019s pint-size bouncer, who joins up with Nate\\u2019s gang and steals a dozen scenes as well as $35,000 from a white-owned bank.\", \"Samuel makes the most of his formidable cast. If anything, he may be overgenerous. The narrative sometimes flags so that everyone can get in a few volleys of the salty, pungent dialogue on the way to the next round of gunplay or fisticuffs. There are imaginative and suspenseful set pieces \\u2014 Trudy peeling an apple while she tells the captive Mary a story; a bank robbery in a town so white that even the dust on Main Street looks bleached \\u2014 and plenty of more conventional episodes of shooting and punching.\", \"\\u201cThe Harder They Fall,\\u201d nodding to the traditions of blaxploitation and spaghetti Westerns in the Netflix era, opts for sprawl and impact \\u2014 the eye-popping cinematography is by Mihai Malaimare Jr. \\u2014 over restraint and coherence. That\\u2019s not such a bad thing, though the story sometimes feels glib as well as messy. A late-breaking revelation that is meant to raise the dramatic and emotional stakes has the opposite effect, and the violence walks the line between stylization and sadism. The bodies pile up at the end, but there are enough people still existing to tease a sequel. No complaints here. That\\u2019s part of how the West was won.\"]","href_hash":"33835c7a3c9811ec8c5a000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"33835c7a3c9811ec8c5a000017025a03"}},
