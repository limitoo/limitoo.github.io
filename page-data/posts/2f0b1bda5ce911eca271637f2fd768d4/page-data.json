Blinken on Tuesday pledged to strengthen relations with Indo-Pacific nations through billions of dollars in American investment and aid and, in doing so, counter Beijing\\u2019s regional pull.\", \"That soft-power pitch was delivered at Universitas Indonesia in Jakarta, the country\\u2019s capital, and continued with a series of agreements on maritime cooperation and education and Peace Corps exchanges. The university was also the site of a speech nearly 60 years ago by Robert F. Kennedy, who spoke then of open relations among states, so long as one did not threaten the rights of others.\", \"Mr. Blinken called it remarkable that the broader goal had changed so little for a region that now accounts for 60 percent of the global economy and is growing faster than anywhere else in the world. The Indo-Pacific covers countries primarily in the Indian Ocean region, including India, Australia, Japan and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN.\", \"\\u201cWe all have a stake in ensuring that the world\\u2019s most dynamic region is free from coercion and accessible to all,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThis is good for people across the region, and it\\u2019s good for Americans, because history shows that when this vast region is free and open, America is more secure and more prosperous.\\u201d\", \"But China, the regional heavyweight, overshadows U.S. trade in nearly country in the Indo-Pacific. In Southeast Asia alone, two-way trade with China reached $685 billion in 2020, more than double that of the region\\u2019s trade with the United States.\", \"China\\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, which is aimed at building infrastructure like ports, railway lines and roads around the world, has continued to make inroads in Southeast Asia even during the pandemic. This month, Laos completed its first high-speed railway, a $6 billion project backed by China. A few weeks before that, Vietnam opened its first metro line in Hanoi, also thanks to China. And in Indonesia, China has spent billions of dollars to build high-speed rail lines, power plants, dams and highways.\", \"\\u201cThe Achilles\\u2019 heel of U.S. policy remains economic engagement, with China far outpacing the U.S. in trade and infrastructure investment,\\u201d said Jonathan R. Stromseth, a Southeast Asia expert and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\", \"Unlike his predecessor, President Biden has avoided directly pressuring other nations to choose between partnering with either the United States or China on a host of issues. Still, Mr. Stromseth said, parallel efforts by China and the United States to outdo each other risks \\u201cthat a bipolar divide is hardening for the long term, with potentially serious consequences for regional stability and development.\\u201d\", \"China has stepped up its military operations in the Indo-Pacific, with warplanes flying over parts of Taiwan and staking claims over disputed territory in the South China Sea. These actions, among others, have put the Pentagon on alert.\", \"Mr. Blinken said bluntly, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t want conflict in the Indo-Pacific.\\u201d Yet he also described \\u201cmuch concern\\u201d in the region over Beijing\\u2019s actions, which he said has distorted open markets with state-subsidized products, limited trade by its adversaries and engaged in illegal fishing. \\u201cCountries across the region want this behavior to change,\\u201d Mr. Blinken said. \\u201cWe do too.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Blinken\\u2019s main message was that the United States is a better bet as a partner than China.\", \"He said the United States had donated 300 million coronavirus vaccines \\u2014 one-third of its worldwide contribution \\u2014 to the Indo-Pacific and would continue to invest billions of dollars in its public health systems.\", \"The vaccines, which Mr. Blinken said were given \\u201cwith no strings attached,\\u201d may prove to be the United States\\u2019 main leverage in Southeast Asia, as hundreds of millions of doses sent by Chinese companies have been found to be largely ineffective against the Delta variant.\", \"On climate, Mr. Blinken noted a $500 million commitment to help finance a solar manufacturing facility in India as among efforts to help the region stave off environmental crises without disrupting economies. He pledged to pursue agreements to bolster data privacy and secure technology used in economic transactions, \\u201cbecause if we don\\u2019t shape them, others will.\\u201d\", \"And he said the Biden administration would work to ease snarls in the global goods supply chain in a region that buys nearly one-third of all U.S. exports.\", \"Across Southeast Asia, private investments by the United States amounted to $328.5 billion in 2020, outpacing China. \\u201cThe region has told us loud and clear that it wants us to do more,\\u201d Mr. Blinken said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll meet that call.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Blinken\\u2019s visit to Indonesia, the largest country in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, was viewed as overdue: Neither Vice President Kamala Harris nor Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III stopped here in recent travels to the region. In a fresh reminder of the nation\\u2019s strategic value, Mr. Blinken arrived only a few hours after Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of the Kremlin\\u2019s Security Council; their planes were parked next to each other at Jakarta\\u2019s airport.\", \"Mr. Blinken\\u2019s speech was well received by some within Indonesia. Tom Lembong, who was Indonesia\\u2019s trade minister from 2015 to 2016, said it \\u201chit the bull's-eye on what policymakers across ASEAN want, which is concrete and practical solutions, and less of the soaring rhetoric that has dominated American official engagement with Southeast Asia over the last two decades.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI would argue that at this time, the Biden administration is succeeding in Southeast Asia \\u2014 they\\u2019re regaining lost ground and making up for lost time,\\u201d Mr. Lembong said in an email.\", \"Many countries in Southeast Asia remain wary of being drawn into a Cold-War standoff between the United States and China. In November, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore indicated that he was uncomfortable with Mr. Biden\\u2019s calls to persuade leaders from democracies to present a more unified front against China.\", \"\\u201cWe all want to work together with the U.S.,\\u201d Mr. Lee said in a November interview with Bloomberg News. But, he added, \\u201cI think not very many countries would like to join a coalition against those who have been excluded, chief of whom would be China.\\u201d\", \"The region is split between countries that are friendlier with China, like Cambodia and Laos, and others that are more hard-line, such as Vietnam. In previous years, the bloc of Southeast Asian states has been torn about how to address the dispute in the South China Sea, with some nations not wanting to offend Beijing.\", \"\\u201cThe sin of China is undermining and breaking up ASEAN,\\u201d said Kasit Piromya, who was Thailand\\u2019s foreign minister from 2008 to 2011. \\u201cChina has the money, they are rich and have their projects and initiatives. But that doesn\\u2019t mean that we have to be their doormat. I think we are terrified of China, but this is not based on reality.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"2f0b1bda5ce911eca271637f2fd768d4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2f0b1bda5ce911eca271637f2fd768d4"}},
