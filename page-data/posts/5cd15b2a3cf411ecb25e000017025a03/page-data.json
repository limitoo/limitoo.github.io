Republicans claimed all three statewide offices in Virginia, will likely take control of the state\\u2019s House of Delegates and came close to upsetting Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey, whose re-election had been presumed safe by officials in both parties.\", \"Just as jarring for Democrats were some of the less prominent contests: The powerful New Jersey State Senate president, Steve Sweeney, was trailing a truck driver who ran a shoestring campaign; a Latino Republican flipped a Democratic seat in South San Antonio; and Democrats were thrashed in local races across Long Island.\", \"The scope of the party\\u2019s setbacks illustrated that voters were fatigued from the demands of the still-continuing coronavirus pandemic and angry about the soaring prices and scarcity of goods they were confronting every day. While Democrats\\u2019 strength in cities and some large suburbs saved them from even deeper losses, their electoral coalition showed signs of fraying as voters vented their unhappiness with the party in power.\", \"Responding to Tuesday\\u2019s results like an alarm bell in the night, Democrats on the ballot next year said that unless Mr. Biden and other party leaders addressed voters\\u2019 close-to-home frustrations, they were certain to lose their congressional majorities.\", \"\\u201cWe were so willing to take seriously a global pandemic, but we\\u2019re not willing to say, \\u2018Yeah, inflation is a problem, and supply chain is a problem, and we don\\u2019t have enough workers in our work force,\\u2019\\u201d said Representative Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat facing a bruising re-election. \\u201cWe gloss over that and only like to admit to problems in spaces we dominate.\\u201d\", \"More pointedly, Ms. Spanberger said Mr. Biden must not forget that, for many voters, his mandate was quite limited: to remove former President Donald J. Trump from their television screens and to make American life ordinary again.\", \"\\u201cNobody elected him to be F.D.R., they elected him to be normal and stop the chaos,\\u201d she said, alluding to the sweeping agenda the president is seeking to enact with the thinnest of legislative majorities.\", \"Democrats in Washington on Wednesday appeared no less determined to forge ahead with Mr. Biden\\u2019s signature domestic legislation: a major infrastructure bill and a multi-trillion-dollar package of social-welfare programs and initiatives to fight climate change. Both moderate and liberal lawmakers say they feel new urgency to show voters they can get big things done.\", \"But Democratic officials also conceded that voters seemed to have penalized the party for devoting months to opaque negotiations on Capitol Hill over legislation that they have spent little time explaining to the public.\", \"Many progressive Democrats believe the only way the party can appeal to voters next year is to deliver for them a range of accomplishments aimed at improving their quality of life. Passing the fullest version of the president\\u2019s social welfare and climate legislation, they say, is crucial to motivating voters in the midterm.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re seeing the expectations of our base not being fulfilled and that\\u2019s suppressing the vote by itself,\\u201d said Representative Raul Grijalva, a progressive Arizonan, who expressed frustration at moderates for holding up the party\\u2019s agenda and said he would no longer adhere to \\u201cthat code of silence\\u201d about Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. \\u201cWe\\u2019re mad at them, but we can\\u2019t say anything because it might make them weirder.\\u201d\", \"Yet Representative Kathleen Rice, a Democrat from Long Island, said the party should be careful about including too much in its social-welfare legislation. \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand some of my more progressive colleagues saying last night now shows us that what we need to do is get both of these bills done and shove even more progressive stuff in,\\u201d Ms. Rice said. \\u201cWhat we\\u2019re talking about is not resonating with voters.\\u201d\", \"What both factions agree on is that Democrats will be punished again in 2022 if Americans do not feel better about the direction of the country than they do today.\", \"Mr. Biden and his aides have effectively staked his presidency on the belief that voters would reward him \\u2014 and other Democrats \\u2014 for steering the country out of a crippling public-health crisis and back to economic prosperity. His aides have repeatedly briefed members of Congress on plans to trumpet the country\\u2019s recovery before the midterm elections and educate voters about how the Democrats\\u2019 initiatives have improved their lives.\", \"Yet even as the economy has partly rebounded and the pandemic has greatly receded, Mr. Biden has not begun to deliver a message that happy days are here again. Nor has he undertaken any kind of large-scale, sustained campaign to remind people of the economic stimulus and mass-vaccination programs that defined his administration in the early days.\", \"In the absence of such a concerted appeal from the president, many voters appear to have sunk into a state of glum pessimism. In both Virginia and New Jersey, polls consistently found that large majorities believed the country was on the wrong track, even though most American adults were now vaccinated and schools had reopened.\", \"Now, Democratic officials say, the party must do more to address head-on the electorate\\u2019s deep malaise or risk watching voters lurch back toward the G.O.P. by default.\", \"\\u201cPeople are fatigued and confused, and they want to get back to their normal lives, whatever that might be,\\u201d said Loretta Weinberg, a Democratic state senator in New Jersey. \\u201cThey want their schools open, and they want their health care protected, and they want to have an option of working and operating businesses.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Weinberg, a longtime party leader, said Democrats had not sufficiently reckoned with the demoralizing effects of the coronavirus pandemic. On the right, she said, there were \\u201chorrendous and hateful\\u201d attitudes toward state officials who battled the disease. But there was not equal and opposite political engagement among Democrats.\", \"\\u201cWe are a high-property-taxes, very densely populated, very diverse state, with all of the problems of people living close together during a time of a pandemic \\u2014 tough decisions of closing schools and closing down the economy,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd it all came back to roost.\\u201d\", \"In Virginia, Representative Donald McEachin said voters were chafing to \\u201creturn to normal as quickly as possible,\\u201d and he urged his fellow Democrats to speak directly to that impatience.\", \"\\u201cTo the extent that things aren\\u2019t normal, they need us as leaders and as civil servants to acknowledge that and tell them how we\\u2019re going to make it better,\\u201d Mr. McEachin said.\", \"The Richmond-based Democrat blamed his party\\u2019s nominee for governor, Terry McAuliffe, not only for failing to engage restive voters but also for a particularly harmful sin of commission. Mr. McAuliffe, he said, had undermined Democrats with a \\u201chorrible misstatement\\u201d near the end of the campaign, saying in a debate he didn\\u2019t think \\u201cparents should be telling schools what they should teach.\\u201d\", \"The remark appeared to dismiss the role of parents in shaping their children\\u2019s education \\u2014 and Glenn Youngkin, the Republican candidate for governor, brandished it as proof that Democrats were indifferent to voters\\u2019 grievances.\", \"\\u201cYou cannot tell a group of people who have had, for 18 months or so, to have to home-school their children that their opinion about their children\\u2019s education doesn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d Mr. McEachin said, stressing: \\u201cI do think that we as a party need to acknowledge that people have been through a lot in the last 18 months.\\u201d\", \"Where there are tactical differences in the party is over how much to continue linking Republicans to Mr. Trump, as Mr. McAuliffe did at the expense of any other message in Virginia.\", \"Some lawmakers, like Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, believe Tuesday\\u2019s results showed that the focus on Mr. Trump is ineffective.\", \"But Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was not second-guessing it.\", \"\\u201cGlenn Youngkin got away with being all things to all people, and we can\\u2019t let them do that,\\u201d Mr. Maloney said, adding: \\u201cThe House Republicans have cast their lot with the toxic Trump agenda of lying about the election, of minimizing the pandemic, of ignoring the attack on the Capitol.\\u201d\", \"While more unexpected, the Democratic defeats on Tuesday were not as overwhelming as the last time the party controlled the presidency and Congress, in 2009, when Republicans won the Virginia governorship by 17 percentage points and the New Jersey governorship as well. Deepening polarization has entrenched Democrats in some suburban jurisdictions, such as Virginia\\u2019s Fairfax County, which Mr. McAuliffe carried by 30 percentage points in his comeback bid.\", \"These suburban voters, who remain disdainful of Mr. Trump, may not be reachable for Republicans next year. There are, however, two sides to the country\\u2019s growing polarization, and the sweeping losses that Democrats suffered in rural Virginia and in New Jersey demonstrated that they were at grave risk of losing even more states and districts next year with sparse populations.\", \"What gives Democrats some optimism is the idea that, while their candidates this year were running against an unsightly backdrop of intraparty legislative wrangling, there will be major accomplishments to trumpet next year.\", \"\\u201cWhen we\\u2019re talking process, we\\u2019re losing, but once the process is done, we\\u2019re going to have lots to say about what we\\u2019re doing for real people,\\u201d John Anzalone, Mr. Biden\\u2019s pollster, said.\", \"Of course, by the 2010 midterms, Democrats had the opportunity to promote the Affordable Care Act and still suffered sweeping losses \\u2014 in part because they were not seen as sufficiently focused on reviving the post-recession economy.\", \"The effects of the pandemic, particularly with students and parents, is \\u201ca national crisis and pretending otherwise is not fooling anybody,\\u201d said Howard Wolfson, a longtime Democratic strategist. \\u201cOur conversation as a party has to align with what people care about.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Wolfson said Democrats must make \\u201ca course correction\\u201d and recognize that Mr. Biden should fulfill his promise to \\u201cbattle Covid and return some bipartisan normalcy to Washington.\\u201d\", \"If they don\\u2019t, he said, \\u201clast night\\u2019s rain is going to look like a tiny drizzle because the hurricane is coming.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"5cd15b2a3cf411ecb25e000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5cd15b2a3cf411ecb25e000017025a03"}},
