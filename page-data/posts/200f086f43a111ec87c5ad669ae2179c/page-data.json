Sometimes, he has recorded the audio of sexual intercourse. He packaged these recordings with commentary for men who paid for access to his Black Sheep Bandit website's \\\"vault.\\\"\", \"Among his content is Ralis talking about targeting \\\"teenage girls\\\" for their sexual inexperience because they are \\\"the most adventurous.\\\" He details one pursuit of a 17-year-old girl in Poland, emphasizing that she was a virgin before he slept with her.\", \"In a podcast episode, Ralis also described one of his course products as: \\\"Seventeen hours of me in 2016 picking up virgins, late teen girls, beautiful girls as a 36-year-old guy. So that sums up what's possible in your thirties.\\\"\", \"As Tom Torero, Ralis was a globally renowned figure among London's \\\"daygamers,\\\" pick-up artists (PUAs) who target women in the daytime. He virtually disappeared from the internet starting in late 2020, leaving his male fans pining after him ever since.\", \"But throughout his absence, Ralis' Black Sheep Bandit website has continued to offer a trove of pick-up coaching content behind a paywall. Among the course packages available was Hustler Pro, valued at $299. It includes the Stealth Seduction program, which promises \\\"27 videos of Tom infield around the globe, totaling over 12 hours of content.\\\"\", \"The sexual content suggests Ralis has been in breach of the terms and conditions of the tech companies he has used to keep Black Sheep Bandit in business for years, including YouTube, Stripe, Amazon, PayPal, MailChimp, and Kajabi.\", \"Pick-up artists are self-professed \\\"dating coaches\\\" who teach men how to get women to have sex with them. They promote coercive, deceptive and manipulative techniques, as well as pseudoscience of the female mind and behavior. As such, the pick-up community has drawn accusations of encouraging misogyny, harassment, emotional abuse, and sexual assault.\", \"They formed an underground seduction community until journalist Neil Strauss' 2005 book The Game\\u2014widely regarded as a PUA Bible\\u2014popularized the practice. PUAs have since integrated into the manosphere, an online conglomerate of fringe masculinist groups that endorse misogyny and revile feminism.\", \"Manosphere communities include incels (involuntary celibates) and MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way.) As some more extreme adherents have perpetrated real-life deadly attacks, manosphere groups have faced widespread ire and online deplatforming.\", \"In 2019, a BBC Panorama investigation into PUA methods rattled the pick-up community, and led YouTube to crack down on their channels.\", \"\\\"No excuses, please don't email me and say, 'Tom, what do you do on a date?'\\\" Ralis said.\", \"\\\"Cause there's 17 hours of me with 17 girls in, whatever, 16 countries.

Yup, Asian.\\\"\", \"For Stealth Seduction, Ralis recorded multiple women from the moment he approached them in public places until he has had sex with them.

Yet at certain points in the video's commentary, Ralis spoke of pre-emptively thwarting LMR, or \\\"last minute resistance,\\\" a PUA term referring to women changing their minds close to sex.\", \"According to the Stealth Seduction handbook, the product includes an episode of Ralis with a 17-year-old Polish girl, but specifies: \\\"No lay audio is included as she is under 18 years old.\\\"\", \"With lots of emphasis on the teenager's virginity, Ralis wrote about approaching her outside a shopping mall, then trying to \\\"physically escalate\\\" at his apartment on the same day. He reported having finally had sex with the girl after additional dates over the following days.\", \"Ralis normally does not go on more than three dates with the same person, he stated, \\\"but a virgin is different.\\\"\", \"\\\"Teenage girls are often shy and inexperienced but the most adventurous,\\\" he wrote.\", \"In a Tom Torero Podcast episode announcing Stealth Seduction, Ralis stated he hoped his clients would \\\"progress your game so that the girls are younger and the girls are hotter.\\\"\", \"\\\"No need to hide behind saying you're in it for self-actualization or deep personal development,\\\" he said. \\\"No. That might happen as a byproduct, but you're in this to bang younger, hotter girls. And be proud of it. Own it.\\\"\", \"In a separate podcast episode, Ralis stated the pinnacle of men's \\\"sexual market value\\\" is in their thirties, while that of women peaks between 16 and 21 years old.\", \"\\\"My peak year of daygame, let's say for beauty results, efficiency, all of that, was 2016, when I was roughly 36 years old,\\\" he said. \\\"That's the year I was sleeping with 17 year olds in Poland\\u2014legal\\u2014many 18 year olds, 19 year olds, it was coming easier.\\\"\", \"He went on to promote Stealth Seduction to \\\"watch me during that magic year.\\\"\", \"On his podcast, Tom Ralis has advised secretly turning a woman's phone to silent while attempting to initiate sex, scarcely communicating to \\\"give her the gift of chasing you,\\\" hinting at future plans to falsely lead women to believe \\\"this is not a one-night stand,\\\" even leaving items such as stray hairs, earrings or wine glasses at home to \\\"trigger her imagination.\\\"\", \"\\\"The male brain is linear and it's logical,\\\" Ralis once said. \\\"Women, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\", \"\\\"They like the blank spaces. They like filling in the gaps. They like these emotional rollercoasters. They love drama, because they love that hamster wheel spinning in their mind.\\\"\", \"During his Daygame 3.0 seminar, Ralis similarly endorsed emotionally manipulative techniques.\", \"While broaching LMR, he advised that when hitting a \\\"brick wall\\\" with a woman who won't have sex, the man should abruptly end things there, show her the door, and cut all communication. Some women, he said, will eventually return like a \\\"boomerang.\\\"\", \"At one point during the seminar, he spoke of wading into the \\\"dark world\\\" of \\\"making girls fall in love with you and then running away.\\\"\", \"\\\"Golden question on the date: Say to her, 'Do your parents live together?' If she says no, you've got a very high statistical chance, it's a sad thing,\\\" Ralis said. \\\"Girls that were raised by their mothers without a father. They do crazy shit.\\\"\", \"He also discussed sparking conflict with women in order to render them dependent.\", \"\\\"It's a little bit dark, but if you create drama with a girl, you get amazing results,\\\" Ralis told his audience. \\\"Drama gives them a dopamine hit and then removes the dopamine. They literally get drug cravings.\", \"\\\"Real dark triad guys and pimps that we'll talk about, they really use drama and basically getting the girl addicted. Addicted so she can't leave you.\", \"\\\"We gotta talk about it, cause these are techniques that I used.\\\"\", \"On his podcast, Ralis delved into the dark triad, a term in psychology used to describe the combined personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy.\", \"\\\"So narcissism is extreme selfishness, you've got that crazy grandiose view of yourself,\\\" Ralis said. \\\"You crave admiration. You're cocky, you're confident, you lead, you pull the trigger. This is all pure game, yeah?\", \"\\\"Machiavellianism is the definition of game. It means being manipulative, playing people, very, very calibrated to human psychology, so you can be deceitful, you can exploit certain social situations.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931158/tom-torero-pick-artist-logo.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Stock image. In the center is the old logo from Tom Torero's now defunct podcast about his pick-up artist work. </div>\", \"Ralis has long spoken of struggles with chronic acne, depression and anxiety throughout his youth. He studied biological sciences at Oxford University, where he said famed evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins was one of his lecturers.\", \"During his PUA career, Ralis has referred to himself as a \\\"biologist\\\" to substantiate his takes on women.\", \"He first picked up a copy of The Game in 2005, as he pursued a vocation in teaching. While employed as a school teacher in London, he began moonlighting as a pick-up artist.\", \"He eventually quit his teaching job in 2012 to join Daygame.com, a London-based PUA company.\", \"Speaking into his recording device on his way to a date in Wales with a divorc\\u00e9e he had previously approached, Ralis talked in layman's terms.\", \"\\\"Alright, first date, day two in Cardiff with the Iranian MILF, wish me luck,\\\" he told his listeners, mentioning a term used to sexualize mothers. \\\"I've only got one night here, so we have to escalate fast and pull the trigger.\\\"\", \"\\\"Her kids are at home as well,\\\" he continued. \\\"So I've sorted logistics, got a venue one, got a venue two.\\\"\", \"Ralis comes prepared with two venues to take his dates to. The second must be conveniently located near his home or hotel.\", \"In the Stealth Seduction handbook, he wrote about his successes in breaching his Iranian date's personal boundaries, as she was \\\"hesitant\\\" about kissing him or getting too close.\", \"\\\"In the first venue she opens up about cultural differences with her Muslim background and her inexperience with guys after getting divorced,\\\" he wrote. \\\"She's hesitant about drinking, and tells me she's not into casual sex.\", \"\\\"With a bit more spiking, I get her to admit that she had a One Night Stand with a guy she met in Barcelona. This gives me the green light I need to escalate harder.\\\"\", \"In his Daygame 3.0 seminar, Ralis spoke of taking it upon himself to start touching the women, using pretexts such as tall tales about the significance of each finger in ancient times or feigning curiosity about tattoos.\", \"\\\"If you get a green light like she pulls down her top to show you, [...] that's it,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Uber, yeah? Compliance. Why are you still in the f***ing bar, yeah?\\\"\", \"Ralis also reported using women's hair to his advantage: \\\"I often say, 'Did you ever have your hair down to here?' And then I touch her ass.\\\"\", \"The PUA went on to speak of his trademark \\\"floppy test,\\\" which is conducted by pushing the woman around or pulling her in.\", \"\\\"At that moment, if she leans into you, if she goes floppy, if she's completely compliant\\u2014remember that magic thing we talked about, compliance?\\\" Ralis could be heard saying. \\\"Finish the date.\\\"\", \"\\\"You get a window, girls give you a window, it's like cooking a boiling water [sic], and you get about half an hour, you get about an hour's window, max,\\\" he continued. \\\"You heat her up, you seal the deal.\\\"\", \"Ralis told his audience he \\\"used to lie\\\" to women about looking for a next venue when he intended on leading them home. He has since opted to \\\"seed\\\" conversational cues about his advantageously close residence, such as speaking of his guitar or offering up leftover alcohol.\", \"In his Daygame 3.0 seminar, he referred to these conversations as \\\"interviews.\\\"\", \"\\\"Girls on the feedback front of Stealth Seduction\\u2014and you can hear the interviews in the product after\\u2014a lot of them said, 'When you approached me, I was nervous.
