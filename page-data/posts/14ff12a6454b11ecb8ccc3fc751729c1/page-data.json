One nation under God and one religion under God,\\\" Flynn, who was recently forced to refute claims from believers of the QAnon conspiracy theory that he worships Satan, said.\", \"Flynn also called Steve Bannon's indictment after defying a subpoena from the House panel investigating the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol an \\\"abuse of freedom of speech.\\\"\", \"He branded the investigation an \\\"insurrection crucifixion\\\" and compared House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Pontius Pilate, who ordered the crucifixion of Jesus in the Bible.\", \"\\\"This is a crucifixion of our First Amendment, freedom to speak, freedom to peacefully assemble,\\\" Flynn said. \\\"It's unbelievable.\\\"\", \"Flynn's comments that the U.S. should only have one religion prompted condemnation on Twitter.\", \"\\\"These people hate the US Constitution,\\\" tweeted Rep. Ilhan Omar.\", \"Walter Russell Mead wrote: \\\"A thought that every one of the Founding Fathers would reject, rightly, as inimical both to the principles of the United States and to the health of the Christian church.\\\"\", \"Rep. Ted Lieu added: \\\"I'm Catholic and do we really want government to force everyone to go to confession? I got baptized in college and those Church courses were soooo long. Michael Flynn would fall asleep in Church class. Sure glad we live in a Constitutional Republic instead of a theocracy.\\\"\", \"Preet Bharara, a former U.S. Attorney fired by Trump, wrote: \\\"Wow look how much Michael Flynn hates America.\\\"\", \"Fred Guttenberg wrote: \\\"I am assuming when Michael Flynn tells his GQP followers we need to be a nation with \\\"one religion\\\" he probably is not thinking Judaism. And so, it begins. Maybe teaching history about things like race in America and the Holocaust do matter.\\\"\", \"\\\"Michael Flynn and the hard right MAGA cult want a theocracy in this country for a white Christian minority,\\\" The Daily Beast columnist Wajahat Ali wrote.\", \"\\\"Just replace everything they say about Jesus with Muhammad and Christianity with Islam and how would the GOP respond? They're telling your their vision and their plan.\\\"\", \"Flynn was ousted from his White House role just weeks into his tenure after reports that he had misled then-vice president Mike Pence and others about communications he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S.\", \"Flynn later admitted to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Sergei Kislyak and reached a plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller.
