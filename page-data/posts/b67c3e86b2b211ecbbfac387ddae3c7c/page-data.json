The change still has to pass the House of Representatives and to be signed off by President Joe Biden.\", \"On the other side of the Atlantic, the European Union parliament voted in 2018 to scrap daylight saving permanently, but the progress of the decision, and agreement about which bodies and countries will ratify it and what time they will settle on, have stalled with the pandemic.\", \"Fire and Emergency community readiness manager Steve Turek said checking smoke alarms is easy and should actually be done once a month, but the beginning and end of daylight saving time were a good calendar reminder.\", \"Batteries should be checked, and alarms' test functions should be run to see that they were working.\", \"Fire and Emergency recommends having an alarm in every bedroom, living area and hallway, and for families to have an escape plan and meeting point.
