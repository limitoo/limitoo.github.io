Let’s skip ahead.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-17T04:57:53.000Z","content":"[\"Our N.F.L. playoffs calculator has an up-to-date look at the latest playoff picture.\", \"Time is a flat circle, but we want to help you break it. To that end, we\\u2019ve enlisted two experts \\u2014 one familiar with the ins and outs of New York\\u2019s professional football teams, the other a nationally focused football analyst \\u2014 to answer an essential question as a weekly service to readers: Are the Jets good yet?\", \"Devin Gordon, the author of \\u201cSo Many Ways to Lose: The Amazin\\u2019 True Story of the New York Mets, the Best Worst Team in Sports,\\u201d observed the Jets from a locally focused perspective.\", \"Diante Lee, an N.F.L. analyst at Pro Football Focus, offered a national view.\", \"Mike White threw four interceptions and was pulled from the game in the fourth quarter for 36-year-old Joe Flacco as the Jets lost to the Bills, 45-17, Sunday.\", \"Mike White \\u2014 what can we say? It was brief, it was hot, but now it\\u2019s over. We\\u2019ll always have Cincinnati.\", \"For a few weeks, White, the plucky former practice squad quarterback turned emergency starter, gave Jets fans a nice diversion from reality. But on Sunday, the Buffalo Bills\\u2019 top-ranked defense brought them \\u2014 and him \\u2014 crashing back to it. White threw four ugly interceptions and managed only 10 points before being benched for Joe Flacco (who threw the Jets\\u2019 only passing touchdown). The imaginary quarterback controversy is over.\", \"Let\\u2019s be grateful, though, and think of this stinker as White\\u2019s parting gift to the fan base \\u2014 a deft way of firing everyone up for Zach Wilson\\u2019s return from an ankle injury. The Jets were never going to make the playoffs. A winning record would have been a miracle. The Jets are now 2-7, which is exactly what you\\u2019d guess the Jets\\u2019 record would be through nine games. This season is about one thing and one thing only: progress.\", \"Ten weeks into the season, though, the Jets still have no idea what they have in Wilson, which makes it awfully tough to measure the progress of those around him. The rookie tailback Michael Carter has topped 80 total yards in four straight games, and his snap percentage keeps increasing, but is he a budding star, or the beneficiary of more efficient quarterback play?\", \"The rookie receiver Elijah Moore had just nine catches in five games with Wilson under center; with Wilson out, he caught 16 balls for 195 yards and three touchdowns. Is he a star? Even the Jets\\u2019 defense \\u2014 the N.F.L.\\u2019s worst by several metrics \\u2014 has to be viewed in the context of the offense\\u2019s 28th ranking in time of possession. It is hard to stop Josh Allen, or anyone, when you\\u2019re exhausted by the third quarter.\", \"Over the next three weeks, Wilson will get to face three of the N.F.L.\\u2019s worst defenses \\u2014 four, if you count Jets practices. Time for some answers.\", \"Verdict: The 2021 regular season ended this week. The future starts next week.\", \"In the stages of grief, it feels as though the Jets have skipped straight from bargaining to acceptance. Joe Flacco made an appearance on Sunday, for goodness\\u2019 sake. This thing is over, it wasn\\u2019t fun while it lasted. They didn\\u2019t make any friends along the way. And the greatest silver lining is that there are only nine weeks remaining in the schedule.\", \"The Jets were able to produce two amazing moments in the first half of the year: They squeezed by with wins against the \\u201cactually good\\u201d Tennessee Titans and the \\u201cfake good\\u201d Cincinnati Bengals in front of the home crowd. Zach Wilson provided a bit of hope in that Titans game, and the backup quarterback Mike White had his starting debut immortalized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame. (His 37 completions were a record for a first start.)\", \"But allowing 90 points in 120 minutes of N.F.L. action made those peaks feel as though they happened a season ago.\", \"Listen, as a California kid \\u2014 a San Diegan, specifically \\u2014 I\\u2019ve seen firsthand what it means to support teams that can\\u2019t get right. I grew up buying Padres tickets to watch the best visiting pitchers try for shutouts and traveling to Los Angeles for Clippers games to see opposing N.B.A. players put up 30. Almost every great team in the A.F.C. had a turn at breaking the Chargers\\u2019 hearts before the franchise bolted for Los Angeles.\", \"As the resident of a city without hope in its football team, my advice is to search the schedule for interesting opponents and hope they entertain you.\", \"Verdict: Pray the Jets beat the Dolphins twice so you\\u2019ll at least have a punching bag.\"]","href_hash":"d85c72a2476211eca8317f7ef9459a77"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d85c72a2476211eca8317f7ef9459a77"}},
