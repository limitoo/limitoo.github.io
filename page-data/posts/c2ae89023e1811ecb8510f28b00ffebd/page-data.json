In \\u201cTwilight\\u201d (2008), she brought a specific and sullen appeal to a heroine conceived as a blank slate for female readers; later, in \\u201cPersonal Shopper\\u201d (2017), when Stewart traded her polo shirts for a rich client\\u2019s shimmering dress, you could see both the star and the character regarding her new look in the mirror: Is this me? Could I make it me?\", \"At first, her new drama \\u201cSpencer\\u201d would appear to be a sop for the sort of moviegoer who\\u2019d demand a more rigorous transformation from the \\u201cTwilight\\u201d actress: Directed by Pablo Larra\\u00edn (\\u201cJackie\\u201d), the movie is a psychological portrait of Princess Diana as she unravels, then rallies, over a three-day Christmas holiday. Instead of hiring a British actress, Larra\\u00edn chose Stewart, a contemporary figure of California cool who met me on the day of our interview wearing a brick-red pinstripe suit, her jacket sleeves rolled up to reveal a small constellation of tattoos.\", \"The 31-year-old actress who sat opposite me on a balcony at the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood may not have looked like the obvious pick to play the people\\u2019s princess, but a funny thing happens as you watch \\u201cSpencer\\u201d: The distance that initially seemed so vast between the two women will close to the point where it seems like the canniest casting ever. Stewart, after all, knows a thing or two about a life lived in the public eye, the scrutiny leveled at a high-profile romance, and the private moments snatched away by paparazzi.\", \"Stewart gave her all to the movie, studying Diana\\u2019s posture, mannerisms and accent; the resulting performance, potent and provocative, has thrust her to the front of this year\\u2019s crop of best-actress Oscar contenders. \\u201cI used to think that I needed spontaneity and anxiety to propel me into something truthful and that if I had too much control over it, it was immediately going to become fabricated,\\u201d Stewart said. \\u201cI just didn\\u2019t have the confidence to hold that and be like, \\u2018No, you can design something.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"But Larra\\u00edn had that confidence in her.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019s like an actress from the \\u201950s or \\u201960s,\\u201d the director said. \\u201cWhat she\\u2019s doing for the story can be at a very grounded character level, but it\\u2019s elevated to a poetic level that creates an enormous amount of mystery and intrigue. And that\\u2019s probably the best cocktail you could ever find for a performance on camera.\\u201d\", \"Stewart knew that taking on \\u201cSpencer\\u201d would be a challenge, and in the days leading up to the shoot, she even developed lockjaw as she ceaselessly practiced her British accent. But once she was on set, finally channeling Diana, her fears melted away: \\u201cAt the end of week one, I was like, \\u2018This is the best thing I\\u2019ve ever done. This is the most alive I\\u2019ve ever felt.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Here are edited excerpts from our conversation.\", \"What was your first impression when Pablo pitched \\u201cSpencer\\u201d to you?\", \"He was so sure that I should do this, and I thought that was audacious and crazy because it just doesn\\u2019t seem like the most instinctive, immediate choice.\", \"Did he tell you why it had to be you?\", \"He was like, \\u201cThere\\u2019s something about Diana that we\\u2019ll never know. You make me feel like that. I\\u2019ve seen your work, and I never really know what you\\u2019re thinking.\\u201d And I feel that way about Diana as well. Even though I feel this overwhelming attraction to her spirit and her energy, there\\u2019s something that\\u2019s disarming about her. I want to hang out with her. I want to race her down a long hallway. I want to, like, meet her kid.\", \"Still, was it a natural step to say yes to this movie?\", \"The only reason that you work as an actor for this long is to try and outdo yourself every time. This one was just the proper step up that I couldn\\u2019t really say no to. It was ambitious and attractive, and I was like, \\u201cIf I can\\u2019t do that, then I\\u2019ll just stop and direct movies instead.\\u201d And it\\u2019s fun to imagine a larger conversation. It\\u2019s fun to imagine if you\\u2019re capable of holding that.\", \"What emerged of Diana as you researched her?\", \"There were so many layers to read. There were so many ways in which she tried to reveal herself, that weren\\u2019t necessarily in the form of a direct sentence. She wasn\\u2019t allowed to be like, \\u201cI\\u2019m dying, and he doesn\\u2019t love me.\\u201d I think the way she expressed herself is so interesting because there are so many lenses between you and that communication.\", \"It\\u2019s like, to not acknowledge that every single person in the world is sitting here on this balcony with us is wild. We have to pretend they\\u2019re not because we\\u2019re being nice to each other. Which is nice! But also, we\\u2019re talking to everyone in the whole world right now.\", \"And I\\u2019m asking you to be vulnerable with me, as though what you say won\\u2019t be chopped up, reblogged and retweeted by people who aren\\u2019t here.\", \"You roll the dice, definitely. One could write a very long paper on the exchange between a journalist and an actor. That\\u2019s obviously not why we\\u2019re here, but yeah.\", \"But it kind of is. Diana had to be incredibly savvy about her image and the way it was used, while still radiating utter authenticity. Actors are required to do the same.\", \"Every way that we reach out toward each other has to be designed from an interior place. Therefore, it\\u2019s a form of manipulation. You want someone to understand you; you want to make someone feel the way that you feel. It\\u2019s sad to think about her in general because she\\u2019s just the most coveted, loved and also rejected, self-hating person. Those things shouldn\\u2019t go together.\", \"Unless some of it is cause and some of it is effect. Do we respond to her in a way that causes a little bit of that? When she\\u2019s called the people\\u2019s princess, does that imply a form of ownership?\", \"Of course, which I think she probably tried to cultivate. I think she had to reach out to get any sort of warm acceptance, when obviously at home she felt invisible and unheard and stifled and cold. She was looking sort of everywhere she could for that kind of love. She was the first royal in the entire history of them to reach out and touch people physically, in their face, without gloves on. That rocked people to their core.\", \"How did you square some of her contradictions?\", \"There were people that were like, \\u201cShe would never use profanity.\\u201d And then other memories would be like, \\u201cOh, gosh, she just came in swearing.\\u201d So you can\\u2019t know her. With famous people, you hear someone go, \\u201cI met them once and they\\u2019re not very nice,\\u201d but it\\u2019s like, \\u201cWere you asking them how their day went when they were coming out of the pisser? Maybe they weren\\u2019t nice to you in that moment.\\u201d People love to have one experience sort of sum up an entire human\\u2019s personality. You just have to take everyone\\u2019s perspective and shove them together and kind of figure out your own.\", \"You\\u2019re clearly speaking from personal experience. But in other interviews I\\u2019ve read, you demur when asked to draw a direct line between your time in the public eye and Diana\\u2019s.\", \"The reason I\\u2019m sort of reluctant to acknowledge the comparison is because I\\u2019ve just never been told to sit and stay in the way that was so damaging and dishonest as it was from her perspective. I\\u2019ve really functioned from a place of impulse and discovery and true honesty and spontaneity.\", \"But still, you know what a high level of public scrutiny can be like. You know what it\\u2019s like to have personal moments stolen by photographers.\", \"Do I feel that women are treated unfairly and overly criticized in comparison to men in the press? Absolutely. It\\u2019s a conversation that I want to lean into. But I got very famous because of movies and that just feels different. Diana believed in an ideal that ultimately became clear to her was farcical. Dude, if she knew she was going to be in a loveless marriage \\u2026. Therefore, when people were like, \\u201cWell, she knew what she was getting herself into,\\u201d it\\u2019s like, not at all.\", \"But isn\\u2019t that a critique often leveled against movie stars, too? That they shouldn\\u2019t complain about the paparazzi, because they knew what they were signing up for?\", \"Yeah. I mean, very directly, I didn\\u2019t want to be famous. I wanted to be an actor. And I totally acknowledge that you could be like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about? You don\\u2019t get one without the other.\\u201d But it does feel like cruel and unusual punishment to do something you love and then suddenly feel like, \\u201cWait a second. Was I just shoved over and my shirt pulled over my head and then I was photographed?\\u201d Because I didn\\u2019t choose that.\", \"So why did you choose to be an actor?\", \"I\\u2019ve always said it\\u2019s because it\\u2019s the only job that you could have as a little kid on set. My mom\\u2019s a script supervisor and my dad is an A.D. [assistant director], so I spent a little bit of time on set and there was a kind of circus mentality that is so fun.\", \"Were your parents surprised you chose that path? You started acting professionally at age 8.\", \"Yeah. You think of child actors, and you imagine pigtails and smiles for the camera and Vaseline on your teeth, and I was so far from that. I looked just like my brother. I was the least quote-unquote charismatic child star you could have imagined. But I think the reason that I\\u2019m still an actor, what I really get out of it, is that there are so many versions of yourself that hypothetically are possible in dreamland. I get to live more. I get to fantasize. And the fantasy doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s not real.\", \"You\\u2019re currently casting for your feature directorial debut, \\u201cThe Chronology of Water,\\u201d based on the harrowing memoir by Lidia Yuknavitch. What is it like to be on the other side of the camera, auditioning all these actresses?\", \"I think I have amnesia, because I feel I don\\u2019t want to make them do things that are too hard or to put themselves out there too much, but that\\u2019s what you do. That\\u2019s the whole thing! I need to remind myself that when I was younger, if I liked something, I would have been like, \\u201cI\\u2019ll do whatever you need. I\\u2019ll read five times.\\u201d I just know what a finicky and delicate line that is to let someone know that this is going to pummel you and you have to open yourself to it. It\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m about to punch you in the face. Put your arms down.\\u201d\", \"And if a director told you that her movie would punch you in the face, how would you react?\", \"That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m saying. I would lean in. I\\u2019d show them my chin.\"]","href_hash":"c2ae89023e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c2ae89023e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}},
