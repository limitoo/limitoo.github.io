The police alleged that the younger Mr. Houston, now 67, \\u201cknew information relating to the sexual abuse of a young male in the 1970s and failed to bring that information to the attention of police.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Houston has vigorously denied the accusation and reiterated in his statement on Sunday that \\u201cthese allegations came as a shock to me, and it is my intention to vigorously defend them.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Houston has entered a not guilty plea, according to the Sydney court where his case is being heard.\", \"The police investigation came after an allegation was made to the Australian royal commission on child sexual abuse. In 2014, the commission heard evidence that his father had sexually abused a 7-year-old boy decades earlier. His father, who died in 2004, was never charged.\", \"The Hillsong megachurch grew out of the merger of two organizations: Sydney Christian Life Center, founded by Frank Houston in 1977, and Hills Christian Life Center, founded by his son. It became a global juggernaut at a time when religion was struggling in a secularizing Europe and North America. Powered by a lucrative recording label that dominated Christian contemporary music, Hillsong sold millions of albums and lured large crowds to arena concert performances.\", \"Using a \\u201cseeker sensitive\\u201d approach, it sought to attract young Christians in big cities, or people wary of or unfamiliar with more traditional churches. It attracted celebrities like Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez and Kevin Durant.

Its songs have been blasted in churches from Uzbekistan to Papua New Guinea.\", \"The ideal Hillsong sermon \\u201cleaves people feeling better about themselves than they came,\\u201d Brian Houston has said.\", \"But scandal and criticism have dogged the church.\", \"The church has been slammed for taking a hipster approach to Christianity and for dodging a firm public stance on same-sex marriage and homosexuality.\", \"In November 2020, Mr. Houston fired Carl Lentz, the head pastor of Hillsong\\u2019s New York branch, for \\u201cleadership issues and breaches of trust, plus a recent revelation of moral failures,\\u201d according to an email to churchgoers. Mr. Lentz later wrote on Instagram that he had been unfaithful in his marriage.\", \"Mr. Houston apologized in June 2020 for comments from the leader of the church\\u2019s London branch who appeared to make dismissive comments about the death of George Floyd and the subsequent antiracism protests.\", \"This month, the church also apologized after footage emerged of churchgoers singing and dancing at a youth camp in Sydney seemingly in violation of pandemic restrictions.\", \"After he was charged last year, Mr. Houston stepped away from some responsibilities but retained his role as leader of the church. Then, in December, Hillsong\\u2019s legal counsel advised the church\\u2019s board that it would be \\u201cbest practice\\u201d for Mr. Houston to step away from the church leadership completely while the court proceedings were continuing, the statement on Sunday said.\", \"The hearings would most likely \\u201cbe drawn out\\u201d and take up most of the year, with the pandemic exacerbating a backlog in cases, Mr. Houston said.\", \"Two pastors will take on the roles of interim leaders, and Mr. Houston\\u2019s wife, Bobbie Houston, will continue to \\u201cremain fully engaged in church life.\\u201d\", \"The next hearing in the case is on March 3.\"]","href_hash":"def33652824d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"def33652824d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
