It was a show of support for the government as it battles an alliance of rebel forces threatening to march on the city, but there was strong anti-American sentiment at the gatherings, too.\", \"The fighting in Ethiopia has raged for just over a year now, but what started as an isolated battle between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government and rebels in the northern Tigray region has snowballed into a fight for his political survival.\", \"The Tigrayan rebels formed an alliance last week \\u2014 announced while a senior U.S. envoy was in Ethiopia \\u2014 with eight other militant groups, including the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) based in the country's south. Over the weekend, the OLA commander warned Abiy that forces loyal to the government were defecting, and he claimed the rebels were close to victory.\", \" \\\"What I am sure (of) is that it is going to end very soon,\\\" Jaal Marroo told the French news agency AFP on Sunday. \\\"We are preparing to push for another launch, and for another attack.
