We don't know how many previous tenants there have been that still have a key to that place ... we often park outside our flat in Wellington with our branded car. It's not going to take too much effort to figure out where MPs stay in the city.\", \"\\\"There's no doubt in my mind that things have escalated now, so let's take it seriously.\\\"\", \"Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said one of his electorate offices had been targeted by ongoing attacks by anti-vaxxers.\", \"\\\"I've had to do some additional things that I wouldn't ordinarily do around that ... I've always believed that New Zealand Parliamentarians being as accessible as we are is something that's really special about New Zealand and I generally am really reluctant to see that change.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/280307/eight_col_161121NZHMMCAUCUS9.jpg?1637018442\\\" alt=\\\"Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins during his caucus standup at Parliament, Wellington, 16 November, 2021. \\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPhoto: Pool / NZME / Mark Mitchell\\n</div>\", \"\\\"I think the actions of a small group of individuals are the problem here, and I think it would be really sad to see the openness of our democracy being undermined by a small group of very vocal and aggressive people.\", \"\\\"I've got no problem with people being passionate - but being respectful of the role - and I'd hate to see that very small group upset that.\\\"\", \"Mandatory vaccinations for teachers and health workers took effect today, and Hipkins - who is also Education Minister - said there were relatively few teachers opposed to vaccination.\", \"\\\"The noisy reports that we've been getting from some parts of the sector haven't resulted in a large number of teachers leaving the profession at this point ... I think it is working reasonably smoothly in terms of the vaccination requirements. We don't want to lose teachers as a result.\\\"\", \"\\\"There has been a really active misinformation campaign targeted at some of our M\\u0101ori communities and our M\\u0101ori teachers and we've got to work really hard to overcome that.\\\"\", \"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it was a tough time for New Zealand, and care needed to be taken for MPs, as well as other groups that might be vulnerable.\", \"\\\"For MPs, we do have security reviews that we can do, make sure that their homes are safe, that their families are safe, and I would say that would be important at any given time because there will always be some disgruntlement at decisions that we make,\\\" she said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/280305/eight_col_161121NZHMMCAUCUS4.jpg?1637018347\\\" alt=\\\"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern during her caucus standup at Parliament, Wellington, 16 November, 2021.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPhoto: Pool / NZME / Mark Mitchell\\n</div>\", \"\\\"We do need to make sure that we look after our MPs but ... it's not just about us.
