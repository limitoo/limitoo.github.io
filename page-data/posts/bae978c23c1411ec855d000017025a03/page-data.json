year experiencing its largest quarterly fall on record and the labour market extremely weak, Treasury's advice was clear: 'There are compelling arguments to maintain JobKeeper in its current form.'\", \"\\\"This was the advice irrespective of the fact the review found 15 per cent of businesses subsequently had actually increased their turnover.\\\"\", \"The Treasury department \\u2014 which designed the scheme \\u2014 released a report this month, which argued that many companies that recorded higher turnovers still experienced downturns.\", \"Treasury said turnover could appear higher
