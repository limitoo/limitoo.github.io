She rarely saw characters who looked like her, an American-born daughter of Cuban immigrants, but she didn\\u2019t mind.\", \"Still, she remembers the excitement she felt when a character with a name like hers, Esteban Calderone, showed up on \\u201cMiami Vice.\\u201d She also remembers the confusion. Calderone was a drug dealer, a villain.\", \"Later, when she turned to acting, she discovered similar stereotypes. (She also discovered casting directors who told her that she was too light skinned for Latina roles and too curvy \\u2014 even at less than 100 pounds \\u2014 for anything else.)\", \"\\u201cIt was always a trauma narrative, a screaming mother, a crying mother \\u2014 it was never reflective of what my life was,\\u201d she said. \\u201cMy life was pretty joy-filled.\\u201d\", \"This was on a video call on a recent weekday morning. Calder\\u00f3n Kellet, 46, now an actress-writer-creator-producer, had clicked on from the sunny home office where she has built a career making stories about Hispanic characters that lead with joy \\u2014 notably, as a showrunner of the critically adored reboot of \\u201cOne Day at a Time.\\u201d On Friday, Amazon will debut her first show as a sole creator, \\u201cWith Love,\\u201d a five-episode intergenerational rom-com with each episode structured around a different holiday.\", \"\\u201cIt was so joyful to write it and then so joyful to get to make it,\\u201d she said, leaning into the camera. \\u201cI\\u2019m hoping that that feeling of joy and kindness and thriving and all that yumminess just makes people feel like, \\u2018Oh, this is the warm hug I need right now.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"To speak with Calder\\u00f3n Kellett is to receive that warm hug remotely, like it or not. Even through a screen \\u2014 or maybe, given the nature of her work, especially through a screen \\u2014 she has the kind of big den-mother energy that makes you want to go out and sell a shipping container\\u2019s worth of Girl Scout cookies and also become a slightly better person. Her enthusiasm could come across as na\\u00efve if not for the shrewd intelligence, decades of hard work and ample proof-of-concept backing it up.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019s been at it for a long time, putting in the work,\\u201d Tanya Saracho, a close friend and a fellow showrunner, told me. \\u201cSo when she got her big overall deal, it was like, \\u2018That\\u2019s right. A brown girl can also take up space that way.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"After earning an undergraduate degree in theater and communications at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, Calder\\u00f3n Kellett moved to London for a masters in theater at Goldsmiths College. Back in California, she found herself working as an assistant to the writer and director Cameron Crowe, answering phones and signing for UPS packages.\", \"He encouraged her to write some sample television scripts. A live-action sitcom is just like a play in a proscenium, he told her. Those scripts, plus an evening of monologues that she self-produced, led to her first writers\\u2019 room gig, on \\u201cThe Ortegas,\\u201d a sitcom canceled before its debut.\", \"Other rooms followed \\u2014 \\u201cHow I Met Your Mother,\\u201d \\u201cRules of Engagement,\\u201d \\u201cDevious Maids,\\u201d \\u201ciZombie.\\u201d Some of those rooms felt sexist; some felt racist. (Calder\\u00f3n Kellett recalled how she and she another Latina writer were nicknamed Spic and Span.) She shrugged it off.\", \"\\u201cIt didn\\u2019t bother me,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI just found it ridiculous.\\u201d\", \"After a decade in the business, she felt ready to tell stories that hewed closer to her own. \\u201cI had enough gravitas and enough chutzpah to be able to do it,\\u201d she said. That\\u2019s when she booked a meeting with Norman Lear, the acclaimed sitcom creator and an expert at sneaking critical social issues into friendly half-hour formats. Lear and the showrunner Mike Royce wanted to create a new version of \\u201cOne Day at a Time,\\u201d a sitcom about a single mother that ran from 1975 to 1984.\", \"At the meeting, she pitched him a version centered on a Cuban American family. But she also expressed doubts. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a PTSD, in terms of the deep starvation for representation that my community has,\\u201d she remembered telling Lear. \\u201cAnd then when one thing exists, we can\\u2019t help but want it to make up for 200 years of B.S.\\u201d She told him that only by making the family incredibly specific would the show work. That convinced Lear to book her as a co-showrunner.\", \"\\u201cIt didn\\u2019t take but a second to realize she was the one,\\u201d Lear wrote in an email. \\u201cFour seasons later, none of us had reason to regret it.\\u201d\", \"Justina Machado, the show\\u2019s star and an American-born actress of Puerto Rican descent, appreciated the authenticity of the show. \\u201cShe gives us a way to tell our stories our way \\u2014 to not have our stories whitewashed, to not have our stories be made more palatable,\\u201d she said.\", \"But despite strong reviews, the new \\u201cOne Day at a Time\\u201d had to fight for each of those four seasons, moving from Netflix to Pop TV and ending before its creators felt ready. This happens to many shows centered on Hispanic characters \\u2014 Saracho\\u2019s \\u201cVida,\\u201d \\u201cThe Baker and the Beauty,\\u201d \\u201cBroke,\\u201d \\u201cGrand Hotel.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re, like, really committed to lifting up communities of color, then you need to go, Oh, wait a minute, we have a show that\\u2019s 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes,\\u201d Calder\\u00f3n Kellett said, referring to the score among critics. \\u201cMaybe we should spend a little bit more money on putting the show out there.\\u201d It was one of the few moments in which she spoke with more steel than sunshine.\", \"\\u201cOne Day at a Time\\u201d was canceled about a year ago, in the midst of the pandemic, when she and her husband, the cartoonist Dave Kellett, felt isolated from their extended families. Calder\\u00f3n Kellett is active on social media and typically that\\u2019s a happy place for her. (She often opens up her Twitter account so that aspiring writers, actors and directors can query \\u201cT\\u00eda Glo\\u201d directly.) But when she logged on last year, she instead found a timeline that she described as \\u201ca barrage of Black and brown and queer and Asian bodies in trauma.\\u201d\", \"So she conceived \\u201cWith Love\\u201d as an optimistic response. If she and her husband couldn\\u2019t see their families for the holidays, she would structure every episode of her show around a holiday. If queer characters and characters of color were typically found at the margins of rom-coms and Christmas movies \\u2014 if they were found at all \\u2014 she would put them at the center. And give them a Nancy Meyers kitchen.\", \"She pitched the series in January, assembled a writer\\u2019s room in February, shot it in June. Set in Portland, it follows the Diaz family, an interdependent, intergenerational clan that runs a high-end Mexican American restaurant. Starting on the night before Christmas, it moves through New Year\\u2019s Eve, Valentine\\u2019s Day, Independence Day and the Day of the Dead. Calder\\u00f3n Kellett cameos as T\\u00eda Gladys, a perennial bachelorette who belongs to two book clubs and one wine club. (The book club is basically a wine club, too.)\", \"The relationships can feel glamorized; the elder members of the Diaz family are accepting and loving almost to a fault. I wondered if this was a deliberate overcorrection, a way to make up for all of those decades of drug dealers and gangbangers and crying moms. Not really, Calder\\u00f3n Kellett told me.\", \"\\u201cFamilies do look like this; my family is like this,\\u201d she said. (Several of her colleagues confirmed this. That her parents now live across the street in a house that she mostly bought also feels like corroboration.)\", \"For Emeraude Toubia, an actress of Mexican and Lebanese descent who plays Lily, the Diaz daughter, Calder\\u00f3n Kellett\\u2019s stories didn\\u2019t feel overly romanticized. \\u201cYes, it is idealized,\\u201d she said during a phone interview. \\u201cBut at the end of the day, this is who we are.\\u201d If the show models kindness and understanding, what\\u2019s so wrong with that?\", \"To dedicated rom-com and Christmas movie fans, many of the conventions of \\u201cWith Love\\u201d will feel familiar. But this, too, is deliberate. Steven Canales, another close friend of Calder\\u00f3n Kellett and a creator of \\u201cPose,\\u201d told me that he admired her for putting Hispanic characters into genres where they haven\\u2019t often been invited. \\u201cWhat Gloria deserves more credit for is positioning Latinx people in spaces where we historically have not had access,\\u201d he said, using a gender-neutral term for Latino people.\", \"That\\u2019s how she envisions \\u201cWith Love\\u201d: responsible escapism and a loving way to nudge the culture forward. Positive change, gift-wrapped in the shiniest possible paper.\", \"\\u201cJoy is revolutionary. Showing brown, Black, queer, Asian people experiencing joy and thriving is a part of this revolution,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019m here for it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f6a9cb865da311ec900e8b41a04e3974"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f6a9cb865da311ec900e8b41a04e3974"}},
