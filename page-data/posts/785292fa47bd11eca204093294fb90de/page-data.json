Gates, a former defense secretary and former Texas A&M president, and a committee of conference commissioners, athletic directors, university presidents and athletes prepared in recent months.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know about the word \\u2018transformational,\\u2019 but I think it represents pretty dramatic change in a number of different areas,\\u201d Gates, an N.C.A.A. board member who wrote the first draft of the proposal himself one weekend, said in an interview with The New York Times on Thursday.\", \"Here is a look at what the Gates committee came up with, and the path ahead for the N.C.A.A., which could vote on a new constitution in January.\", \"Yes and no.\", \"The draft calls for students to be able to make money off their fame through activities like endorsement deals and autograph signings, a concept known in the college sports industry as name, image and likeness activity. But students have been able to do that since July, when an interim N.C.A.A. policy took effect after a wave of state laws forced the association\\u2019s hand. The rewritten constitution would make the stopgap changes more permanent.\", \"As usual, the N.C.A.A. is looking to forbid schools from paying players directly, and the draft calls for the association to declare that students \\u201cmay not be compensated by a member institution for participating in a sport.\\u201d\", \"But in a concession to the Supreme Court decision in June, the proposal says students should be allowed to receive \\u201ceducational benefits,\\u201d including cash awards for academic achievement, in addition to whatever money they are able to earn off their names, images and likenesses.\", \"Still, Jordan Bohannon, a men\\u2019s basketball player at Iowa, said the proposal\\u2019s limits made it inadequate.\", \"\\u201cThis is America, and college athletes have rights and freedoms that the N.C.A.A. cannot deny,\\u201d he said in a statement released by the National College Players Association.\", \"The group\\u2019s executive director, Ramogi Huma, said that the proposal amounted to \\u201cmore of the same from the N.C.A.A.\\u201d and that it would spark \\u201cmore of the same from us \\u2014 pursuing governmental action to fight for justice.\\u201d\", \"Each N.C.A.A. division \\u2014 including Division I, whose brand-name schools and enormous revenues dominate public perceptions of college athletics \\u2014 may win the power to govern itself.\", \"The draft says that each division should \\u201chave independent authority to organize itself,\\u201d within the limits of overarching N.C.A.A. principles like a ban on direct salaries, and that each could create new divisions or subdivisions. That kind of power could eventually pave the way for top-tier athletic powers to have their own rules and system but remain under the N.C.A.A.\\u2019s umbrella.\", \"The three divisions are expected to finish initial rewrites of their rules by the start of the 2022-23 academic year.\", \"The process for investigating and punishing N.C.A.A. rules violations could also change.\", \"A critique of the existing rules enforcement system is that protracted inquiries can lead to punishments, like postseason bans, for players and coaches who had little or nothing to do with any violations. In response to that, the proposal calls for divisions to \\u201censure to the greatest extent possible that penalties imposed for infractions do not punish programs or student-athletes innocent\\u201d of any violations.\", \"The Board of Governors, which has ultimate authority over the N.C.A.A. but has been criticized as detached, could shrink to nine voting members from 21. One of the nine would be a recently graduated athlete. (A smaller board was no given: Gates said his committee considered an array of models, including one that would have pushed the board\\u2019s size to 28 members.)\", \"The committee has proposed removing the N.C.A.A.\\u2019s existing, detailed nondiscrimination pledge from the constitution, prompting criticism from groups like the Human Rights Campaign and Athlete Ally. The leaders of those organizations, Joni Madison and Hudson Taylor, urged N.C.A.A. leaders last week to include an \\u201cenumerated policy providing nondiscrimination protections for all athletes.\\u201d\", \"Gates argued that the draft\\u2019s provisions on diversity and gender equity \\u201care pretty strong statements that discrimination won\\u2019t be tolerated.\\u201d\", \"Those sections declare that the N.C.A.A. is \\u201ccommitted to diversity and inclusion,\\u201d say that conferences and schools \\u201cshall create diverse and inclusive environments\\u201d and that divisions, conferences and schools have the responsibility to follow laws concerning gender equity. College sports activities, the draft adds, \\u201cshall be conducted in a manner free of gender bias,\\u201d a subject that surfaced widely this year after disparities between the men\\u2019s and women\\u2019s Division I basketball tournaments.\", \"But some longstanding N.C.A.A. systems and policies are likely to remain the same or close to it. A 1996 formula for revenue allocations for Divisions II and III, for instance, will probably stay untouched, in no small part because the schools in those divisions control most of the votes inside the N.C.A.A.\", \"No. Ten conferences and Notre Dame run the playoff, and the N.C.A.A. has no control over it.\", \"Any changes to Division I could ultimately influence the playoff and the universities that reach it, but the word \\u201cplayoff\\u201d does not even appear in the draft constitution.\", \"Mostly because it realizes it does not have much choice.\", \"The N.C.A.A. has been a legal pincushion for years, and it has lately come under scrutiny not just from the courts but also politicians at the state and federal levels. The Supreme Court\\u2019s ruling this summer, though, alarmed many industry officials because it left the N.C.A.A. even more vulnerable to challenges under antitrust law.\", \"The push to rewrite the constitution amounts to an effort to give the N.C.A.A. more legal cover, though Gates denied that was the association\\u2019s principal motivation. Either way, some scholars are skeptical that the N.C.A.A. will improve its legal position significantly and believe that the association will still wind up fighting plenty of court battles.\", \"Monday\\u2019s convention is just one step. A five-day feedback period will follow. Then the Gates committee, which held eight virtual meetings, as well as in-person sessions in Chicago and Denver, will review the submissions before opening a second opportunity for feedback. Gates\\u2019s panel will submit its final recommendations to the board on Dec. 15, the same day that N.C.A.A. members may begin to propose amendments.\", \"The N.C.A.A. expects to vote on a new constitution on Jan. 20. More months of work will follow, though, as Divisions I, II and III sort through their own plans.\", \"Gates predicted members would offer amendments, but said he would be \\u201cquite surprised if this constitution or something that looks very much like it\\u201d did not pass. But he said he had not begun counting votes.\", \"Well, it is the N.C.A.A.\", \"Asked in a September interview with The Times whether the N.C.A.A. or the Pentagon had the more daunting organization chart, Gates laughed and replied: \\u201cWell, they\\u2019re comparable \\u2014 and incomprehensible. They look like an AT&T wiring diagram.\\u201d\", \"But a lot of people will get to have a say before the N.C.A.A makes any substantive changes, especially changes that could ease all, or even some, of the bureaucracy.\"]","href_hash":"785292fa47bd11eca204093294fb90de"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"785292fa47bd11eca204093294fb90de"}},
