Erin Maye Quade went into labor at about 2 a.m. on Saturday, the morning of Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party convention. She still showed up in labor and gave her speech, her campaign manager Mitchell Walstad told CBS News. \\u00a0\", \"Video taken at the convention shows her holding her stomach and pausing, apparently having a contraction, after finishing a sentence of her speech.\", \"Quade needed to win the endorsement of the party \\u2014 the state equivalent of the Democratic Party \\u2014 at its convention to officially become its nominee.\\u00a0\", \"Today in Minnesota, @ErinMayeQuade gave a convention speech while in active labor.

When a candidate reaches 60% of the votes, they receive the party's endorsement, Walstad said.\", \"\\\"After the first round of balloting, Erin was at the point where she could not stay anymore, and she chose to withdraw,\\\" he said. \\\"She was not forced out, but she chose to [leave] because with endorsing process, there's often a lot of change that can happen between one ballot and the next, and a lot of persuasion can happen if there's no decided candidate after that first round.\\\"\", \"Candidates continue to campaign between votes, but Walstad said Maye Quade felt she couldn't meaningfully meet with delegates and accurately present herself through the process.\", \"Maye Quade asked her opponent, Justin Emmerich, if he would suspend balloting and go to a primary after the first ballots were cast, Walstad told CBS News. Emmerich did not agree to move the voting to a later date.\", \"When she left, delegates could vote for her Emmerich or the \\\"no delegate\\\" option.

I don't know if I can be there. I don't know if I can make it through that long of a period of time without having contractions. I don't think I want to have contractions in front of people,'\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"To say I didn't know how to respond would be an understatement,\\\" Walstad continued. \\\"I encouraged her to do what she needed to for herself.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Maye Quade's wife, Alyse Maye Quade, is the political and organizing director for the party.
