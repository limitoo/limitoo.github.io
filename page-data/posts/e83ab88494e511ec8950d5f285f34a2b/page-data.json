California,\\u00a0Nevada, New Mexico are among the states that discarded mask mandates this month. The return to some semblance of pre-pandemic life also includes some of the country's\\u00a0biggest employers, with other companies going even further and dropping vaccine requirements for workers.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I think people are more comfortable, so even when we had the mask requirement people were still coming out \\u2014 but I think it makes a big difference,\\\" Javier Amaro, a vendor in Las Cruces, New Mexico,\\u00a0told a CBS affiliate.\\u00a0\", \"New York and Rhode Island\\u00a0this month lifted indoor mask rules for businesses, but still require them in schools. Illinois, Oregon, Washington and Washington, D.C., plan to let mask requirements lapse by the end of March. A school mask order in Massachusetts is set to expire at the end of February. \\u00a0\", \"Not everyone is pleased.\", \"\\\"I'm pretty uncomfortable with it,\\\" Massachusetts parent Kerry Arouca said after her state's announcement, according\\u00a0to\\u00a0the Associated Press. \\\"I think that until we get a better handle on COVID-19 that the kids should do their best to keep their masks on, maybe some mask breaks outside until everybody is vaccinated.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"In West Baton Rouge, Louisiana, one school district stopped requiring masks at the end of October. \\\"Just knowing the pulse of our community, they were ready for it,\\\" Wesley Watts, the district's superintendent, explained.\\u00a0\", \"Masks are also optional at a school district in Vienna, Illinois, following a judge's ruling invalidating a state mandate. \\\"We're two years into this thing. So we do have some data, we have some trend history, we have some things we can look at,\\\" said Joshua Stafford, district superintendent.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"On the other side of that coin, you also have those who suffer from autoimmune disorders, other extenuating health circumstances, and that has to be weighed in the balance of this global pandemic,\\\" said Stafford, calling it \\\"not an easy decision.\\\"\", \"For Hawaii Governor David Ige, the decision to stick with the state's mask rules came more easily. Hawaii has the nation's second-lowest death rate from COVID-19 \\\"in part because of the indoor mask mandate,\\\" Ige\\u00a0told local news station KITV.\\u00a0\", \"You gotta love Hawaii. It is the only state holding onto its mask mandate. Forty-nine states have announced plans to drop their indoor mask mandates as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations steadily decline.\\u00a0We\\u2019ve been on this ride before. Bleh.\", \"Puerto Rick is also taking a more cautious approach, with the U.S. territory having no immediate plan to lift a mask mandate.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We are currently seeing a sustained reduction in statistics regarding the positivity rate and hospitalizations, which presents us with a better picture,\\\" Gov.

And even as states relax the rules on facial coverings, unvaccinated people are still required to wear them in some indoor settings and places like nursing homes, public transportation and some schools.\\u00a0\", \"The LA Unified School District on Tuesday dropped its outdoor mask requirements at all of the district's campuses, but not all children followed suit, as many could be seen wearing masks outside.\", \"\\\"I think everyone got used to the masks,\\\" student Andrez Mendoza told a local CBS affiliate. \\\"During PE, which I just had, the teacher said we could remove our masks, and no one did.\\\"\", \"That reluctance to unmask is seemingly shared by a significant number of New Yorkers, at least when contemplating indoor spaces. Nearly two weeks after Gov. Kathy Hochul let the state's indoor mask mandate expire, a survey found that many state residents thought Hochul should have continued the requirement.\", \"\\\"There is no clear consensus on mandating masks in indoor public spaces,\\\" Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said in statement regarding the survey results. \\\"Still, a plurality of voters, 45%, say the indoor mask mandate should remain in place.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"The federal government is also keeping mask regulations in place.
