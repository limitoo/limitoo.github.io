I said that actually, as part of that answer, that what you need to do is do the things that we currently have technology for.\\\"\", \"Some farmers were reducing herd sizes in a way that was beneficial for them, he said.\", \"\\\"Farmers are better off, they're less in debt, they're making more money, they're getting better value at market and they're reducing emissions simultaneously.\", \"\\\"It does feel like everyone's waiting for the silver bullet of a methane vaccine or something like that to happen. Those kinds of technologies may come online but just having a hope that those things might occur doesn't mean that you shouldn't do everything in your power now.\", \"\\\"We've kind of been kicking the can down the road for the better part of 30 years ... we've dabbled half-heartedly with things like the emissions trading scheme and so on but it's really only in the last few years that we've really started to roll that out.\\\"\", \"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the emissions trajectory was \\\"bending\\\" but needed to continue to fall.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/290819/eight_col_220405_Bridge-13.jpg?1649126936\\\" alt=\\\"No caption\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPhoto: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone\\n</div>\", \"\\\"It's another reason why our forthcoming emissions reduction plan is so important.

Electricity we're already 80, 85 percent renewable electricity, which is great and that's without subsidies ... but we can increase that share of renewables higher.\", \"\\\"For heat, a lot of our heating for industrial purposes as well as buildings comes from gas and indeed from coal for some schools and businesses - Fonterra for example, the milk drying - we've got to get rid of that coal and we can have alternatives for that.\", \"\\\"Transport is the hard one and that's been growing the fastest in New Zealand of any sector ... we really do need to encourage more electric cars, less dependency on cars for transport, more use of public transport, more walking, cycling, e-bikes, e-buses.\\\"\", \"ACT leader David Seymour was critical of the lack of action.\", \"\\\"Jacinda Ardern campaigned for prime minister saying climate change would be her generation's nuclear-free moment.
