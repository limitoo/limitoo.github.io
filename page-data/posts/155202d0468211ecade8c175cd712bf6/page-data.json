Astro, told the story, he and his reggae band, UB40, didn\\u2019t even know whose song they were covering when they decided to record what became perhaps their biggest hit. They\\u2019d been smitten by a ska version of the song \\u201cRed Red Wine,\\u201d which was recorded by Tony Tribe in 1969.\", \"The seven-inch vinyl carried the credit \\u201cN. Diamond,\\u201d Mr. Wilson said, and he and his bandmates assumed that it referred to a Jamaican artist named Negus Diamond.\", \"\\u201cYou could\\u2019ve knocked us out with a feather when we found out it was actually Neil Diamond,\\u201d he told Billboard in 2018.\", \"The song was included on UB40\\u2019s 1983 album of covers, \\u201cLabour of Love,\\u201d and a pared-down version released as a single became a modest hit. Then, five years later, the longer version became an even bigger hit. Ali Campbell is the main vocalist on both, but the longer version includes Mr. Wilson\\u2019s distinctive toasting, or rapped vocals, which begin, \\u201cRed red wine, you make me feel so fine; you keep me rocking all of the time.\\u201d\", \"How popular did that rendition become? So popular that Mr. Diamond took to performing the song \\u2014 which he\\u2019d originally rendered as a glum ballad \\u2014 with a catchy reggae beat and including a toasting section in which he imitated Mr. Wilson\\u2019s cadence. \\u201cRed red wine you make me feel so fine, hear it on the radio all of the time,\\u201d Mr. Diamond sang in Buffalo in 1989. \\u201cI don\\u2019t care if the words are all wrong; I don\\u2019t care \\u2019cause they\\u2019re playing my song!\\u201d\", \"Mr. Wilson died on Nov. 6, Mr. Campbell announced on social media. He was 64. No cause of death was given, and the posts did not say where he died.\", \"Mr. Wilson joined Mr. Campbell and six others in UB40 in 1978 in Birmingham, England. None had extensive music backgrounds, but they developed their own sound and style; Mr. Wilson was the toaster, trumpeter and percussionist.\", \"The eight were a racially diverse group, unusual for the reggae genre, most of whose stars were Black; Mr. Wilson was one of two Black members. But they were united by one thing when they came together: All were unemployed. The group\\u2019s name came from a bit of government paperwork, Unemployment Benefit Form 40.\", \"Soon UB40 was famous and touring the world. Interviewed in 2005 by The Dominion Post of New Zealand on the occasion of the release of the group\\u2019s 23rd album, Mr. Wilson put his change in fortunes simply: \\u201cIt is like winning the lottery every week.\\u201d\", \"Terence Wilson was born on June 24, 1957, in Birmingham. His nickname came long before he thought of being in a reggae group.\", \"\\u201cAs a kid I used to run round with four or five other kids wearing these Doc Martin boots,\\u201d he told The Dominion Post, \\u201cand the actual model name was Astronauts.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Wilson was an out-of-work cook when he joined the band, which had already begun rehearsing, in 1978. He and the others bucked the trend of the moment \\u2014 punk \\u2014 and instead tried making the music they listened to and loved.\", \"\\u201cWe knew we had something fresh that hadn\\u2019t been heard before,\\u201d Mr. Campbell told The Honolulu Star-Advertiser in 2019.\", \"Starting out by playing clubs, the band by 1980 was opening for the Pretenders on tour, raising its profile considerably, especially in Britain. Chrissie Hynde, the Pretenders\\u2019 vocalist, had heard the band and become a champion; in 1985 she was a guest on another of the group\\u2019s best-known songs, a cover of Sonny and Cher\\u2019s \\u201cI Got You Babe.\\u201d\", \"Much of the group\\u2019s popularity rested on covers \\u2014 among its other biggest hits was its version of a song made famous by Elvis Presley, \\u201cCan\\u2019t Help Falling in Love,\\u201d released in 1993. But the band also recorded original material, much of it with a political edge. An early signature song, in 1981, was called \\u201cOne in Ten,\\u201d the title referring to unemployment statistics.\", \"Mr. Campbell split from the original group in 2008 in a dispute over management. Mickey Virtue, the keyboardist, joined him soon after, and Mr. Wilson joined them in 2013; they continued to perform as UB40 Featuring Ali, Astro and Mickey. (Another group continued on as UB40.) Mr. Virtue left the splinter group in 2018, but Mr. Wilson and Mr. Campbell continued to perform and record.\", \"Information on Mr. Wilson\\u2019s survivors was not immediately available.\", \"Although the original UB40 lineup eventually fractured, Mr. Wilson said his musical goals remained constant.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re still on our same mission, which is to popularize reggae music around the world,\\u201d he told The Dayton Daily News in 2017, when he and Mr. Campbell brought their version of UB40 to the Rose Music Center in Huber Heights, Ohio. \\u201cWe\\u2019re all pleased the genre is now an international language everybody understands.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s played around the world, and not everybody has English as their first language,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cThey don\\u2019t necessarily understand what\\u2019s being said, but everybody understands a good bass line and a drum beat. I think a bass line can say more than 1,000 words ever could.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"155202d0468211ecade8c175cd712bf6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"155202d0468211ecade8c175cd712bf6"}},
