It was not immediately clear whether the company\\u2019s decision would satisfy airlines and aviation safety regulators.\", \"\\u201cWe are launching our advanced 5G services everywhere else as planned with the temporary exception of this limited number of towers,\\u201d an AT&T representative said in the statement. The company did not say at which airports it will delay activating the new service, which will expand coverage of the fast, next-generation 5G network.\", \"Verizon, which is also slated to turn on its own new service on Wednesday, declined to comment.\", \"AT&T\\u2019s announcement came just after the executives of several airlines and others in the aviation industry sent a letter to the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, saying that they feared chaos at airports and cargo hubs because of restrictions put in place by aviation regulators to avoid interference between the new wireless service and plane equipment used during takeoffs and landings.\", \"\\u201cEvery one of the passenger and cargo carriers will be struggling to get people, shipments, planes and crews where they need to be,\\u201d the executives said. \\u201cTo be blunt, the nation\\u2019s commerce will grind to a halt.\\u201d\", \"On a day like this past Sunday, more than 1,100 flights would have been canceled because of Federal Aviation Administration restrictions put in place for the 5G rollout, affecting about 100,000 passengers, the group said.\", \"The new 5G service uses so-called C-band frequencies, which are close to the portion of airwaves used by radio altimeters, devices that determine the distance between planes and the ground. That measurement is particularly important to pilots when visibility is limited.\", \"Several major companies and Airlines for America, the industry\\u2019s trade organization that organized the letter, did not immediately provide estimates for how many flights would be canceled on Wednesday if the 5G rollout happens as planned. In a separate statement on Monday, United Airlines estimated that the disruptions would affect 1.25 million United passengers and at least 15,000 flights annually.\", \"The airline group offered a solution in the letter: Allow 5G to be put in place nationwide starting on Wednesday, except for within two miles of affected airport runways.\", \"Airlines and the F.A.A. had raised concerns about 5G interference over the past several years, but began escalating warnings in recent months, leading Verizon and AT&T to delay their limited 5G rollout from December to early January and again to this Wednesday. The latest delay came after the F.A.A., which is part of Mr. Buttigieg\\u2019s department, reached an agreement at the start of January.\", \"The F.A.A. said at the time that it would no longer ask for further delays after Verizon and AT&T agreed to the most recent postponement. At the time, Airlines for America said in a statement that it would \\u201ccontinue to work with all stakeholders to help ensure that new 5G service can coexist with aviation safely.\\u201d\", \"The telecommunications industry has pushed back against the concerns raised by the airlines and the F.A.A., noting that the implementation of 5G has been years in the making and that the service has already been introduced in Britain, France and other countries without incident.\", \"\\u201cIn our opinion, the technical information that is being used to generate concern shows improbable worst-case scenarios,\\u201d GSMA, a global wireless industry group, said on Monday.\", \"The F.A.A. has noted, however, that there are technical differences in how 5G is being carried out in other countries. In the United States, planes would be protected from 5G interference only in the last 20 seconds of flight, compared with 96 seconds in France, for example. The temporary power limits that U.S. wireless companies agreed to are still about 2.5 times higher than the permanent limits used in France, according to information the agency posted online.\", \"Last week, the F.A.A. started issuing hundreds of notices to airlines providing updated guidance on how to land planes safely in low-visibility conditions where 5G service is of concern. On Sunday, the agency said it had cleared an estimated 45 percent of the U.S. commercial plane fleet to perform such landings safely, opening up runways at as many as 48 of the 88 airports most directly affected by potential 5G interference.\", \"The Federal Communications Commission, which distributes wireless spectrum, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\"]","href_hash":"5c6b297c788611eca0b13365cab7c589"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5c6b297c788611eca0b13365cab7c589"}},
