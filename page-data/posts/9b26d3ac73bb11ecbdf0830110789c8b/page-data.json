To some, this seemed at first like a side hustle, something to keep Greenwood occupied between albums and tours.\", \"But over the last decade in particular, it\\u2019s become clear that is not the case. With 11 scores to his name, including two \\u2014 for Jane Campion\\u2019s \\u201cThe Power of the Dog\\u201d and Pablo Larra\\u00edn\\u2019s \\u201cSpencer\\u201d \\u2014 that may figure in this year\\u2019s Academy Awards race, what was once a subsidiary career now vies for pre-eminence with Greenwood\\u2019s day job.\", \"As he has moved further into film, he has also achieved some prominence as an orchestral composer, with his concert music often fueling his soundtracks. In a recent interview with Alex Ross of The New Yorker, Greenwood described some of his durable strategies, including the use of octatonic scales, which he said can lend \\u201ca nice, tense sourness in the middle of all of the sweetness\\u201d of a scene.\", \"But if some of his inspirations have remained constant \\u2014 with modernist composers like Olivier Messiaen and Krzysztof Penderecki remaining steady fascinations \\u2014 he has also evolved over time. Here are some highlights from his past two decades of writing for orchestras and films.\", \"Greenwood\\u2019s first soundtrack effort is modest in its ambitions but confident in its execution. It doesn\\u2019t offer full-throated orchestral material or directly invoke the likes of Messiaen or Penderecki. Instead, it is more closely associated with the avant-electronica of \\u201cKid A\\u201d and \\u201cAmnesiac,\\u201d Radiohead albums from just before. Yet \\u201cBodysong\\u201d makes for an effective, ear-catching album. And some tracks are early templates when it comes to Greenwood\\u2019s skill at merging disparate styles, as when the opening jazz combo sound of \\u201cMilky Drops from Heaven\\u201d is overtaken by whirling tendrils of electronic music.\", \"This work heralded Greenwood\\u2019s leap into classical music \\u2014 complete with tightly coiled string clusters inspired by Penderecki. But Greenwood\\u2019s own melodic style, simultaneously swooning and full of unease, is here, too. It\\u2019s the piece that inspired the film director Paul Thomas Anderson to first contact Greenwood, and hearing \\u201cPopcorn\\u201d in full, you understand Anderson\\u2019s early confidence in this composer\\u2019s abilities.\", \"This was the project that Anderson wanted Greenwood for. It uses parts of \\u201cPopcorn Superhet Receiver,\\u201d making it ineligible for an Oscar, but adds some new music that helps render the film\\u2019s pressure-cooker atmosphere as something seductive. Like \\u201cProspectors Arrive,\\u201d with piano, strings and the ondes Martenot in a gorgeous blend of instrumental colors. The Copenhagen Philharmonic later recorded a string orchestra suite culled from the soundtrack.\", \"The original incarnations of \\u201cOvertones\\u201d and \\u201cBaton Sparks,\\u201d from Anderson\\u2019s 2012 film \\u201cThe Master,\\u201d can be heard in this orchestral work. That self-borrowing resulted in another round of Oscar ineligibility, despite the soundtrack\\u2019s excellent original tracks, like the harp-driven \\u201cAlethia.\\u201d And once again, the original orchestral piece is impressive on its own. Taking as its start the lush final chord of Penderecki\\u2019s \\u201cPolymorphia,\\u201d Greenwood pushes into more firmly Romantic territory than in \\u201cThere Will Be Blood.\\u201d (Don\\u2019t worry, though: There\\u2019s still plenty of string noise.)\", \"Anderson\\u2019s adaptation of Thomas Pynchon\\u2019s noirish novel offered an opportunity for Greenwood to broaden his film-score palette. The song \\u201cSpooks\\u201d has its roots in an as-yet-unreleased Radiohead track, but the most winning feature for guitar here is \\u201cAmethyst\\u201d \\u2014 a piece that combines folky strumming and droning background chords to ultimately joyous effect. It goes with a part of the ending that\\u2019s legitimately happy \\u2014 not a regular feature of either Anderson\\u2019s or Pynchon\\u2019s work.\", \"This orchestral work fits well alongside the score for \\u201cInherent Vice.\\u201d You can hear in it some scalar patterns familiar from tracks like \\u201cThe Golden Fang.\\u201d Yet this 14-minute piece (for an unusually outfitted string orchestra, including flutes, ondes Martenot and a tambura) is its own thing, perhaps because of inspiration from various Indian classical music traditions that which Greenwood was immersed in around this time. After what amounts to a slow \\u201calap\\u201d development section familiar from some raga styles, we get a climactic whirlwind tour through Greenwood\\u2019s overarching melodic design.\", \"In an interview with the former New York Times chief classical music critic Anthony Tommasini, Greenwood described drawing inspiration from a wide variety of sources \\u2014 including Benjamin Britten and Bill Evans \\u2014 for the score of this Anderson film, set in the 1950s. But though the music lacks some of the obvious avant-garde touches of Greenwood\\u2019s past work, it\\u2019s still suffused with some of his signatures. A cascading piano riff from \\u201cThe House of Woodcock,\\u201d for example, is a bit familiar when compared with the piano in the second half of \\u201cProspectors Arrive\\u201d from \\u201cThere Will Be Blood.\\u201d But the more sweetly arranged version here gives it an entirely new character.\", \"If the score for \\u201cPhantom Thread\\u201d was uncharacteristically gallant, here is a return to electronically driven, sometimes discordant music, Greenwood\\u2019s second time working with the director Lynne Ramsay. Just as Joaquin Phoenix\\u2019s character stumbles through the plot without a full understanding of what he\\u2019s stepping into, so, too, does Greenwood\\u2019s score keep the listener off balance \\u2014 thanks to rhythmic feints in quasi-dance tracks like \\u201cNausea.\\u201d But it\\u2019s not all mysterious: \\u201cTree Strings\\u201d and \\u201cTree Synthesizers\\u201d help give the final act its surprising effect of release from trauma.\", \"A setting in the old-time American West? Menacing, droning strings? Is this score for Campion\\u2019s first film in 12 years some kind of retread of Greenwood\\u2019s neo-Western work on \\u201cThere Will Be Blood\\u201d? Not at all. Touches here are particular to the waking-dream surrealism of Campion\\u2019s project. \\u201cDetuned Mechanical Piano\\u201d is a bit too refined (\\u00e0 la miniatures by Gyorgy Ligeti) to really be the work of a busted player piano. And the strummed locomotion of \\u201c25 Years\\u201d is a reminder of Greenwood\\u2019s guitar chops, which were heard on his score for \\u201cNorwegian Wood\\u201d (2010).\", \"Larra\\u00edn\\u2019s film, starring Kristen Stewart, isn\\u2019t a conventional Princess Diana biopic. As Diana hallucinates her way through various royal obligations, Greenwood\\u2019s score delights in the way that the film hews closely to her perspective. A track like \\u201cThe Pearls\\u201d starts off as a plausible imitation of decorum, with a string quartet shown onscreen in the entryway to a dining room. But as Diana loses her cool, so, too, does the musical material stretch beyond propriety. (Sure enough, the onscreen quartet responds to the interminable dinner with some thundering accents.) The pairing of improv jazz textures with the escape from courtly life is particularly well done on cuts like \\u201cArrival.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9b26d3ac73bb11ecbdf0830110789c8b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9b26d3ac73bb11ecbdf0830110789c8b"}},
