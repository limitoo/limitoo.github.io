counter rising inflation, but Australia is not in the same boat\\u00a0yet.\", \"New Zealand's central bank on Wednesday raised its cash rate by 25 basis points to 0.75 per cent.\", \"The bank's second consecutive rate hike\\u00a0comes\\u00a0as it withdraws pandemic stimulus that has helped drive\\u00a0consumer price inflation to its highest point since 2010.\", \"It expects CPI inflation to jump above\\u00a05 per cent in the near term before returning towards its\\u00a02 per cent target over the next two years.\", \"\\\"The near-term rise in inflation is accentuated by higher oil prices, rising transport costs and the impact of supply shortfalls,\\\" the bank said in a statement announcing the interest rate hike.\", \"The central bank flagged further tightening given the medium-term outlook for inflation and employment.\", \"In contrast, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)\\u00a0is sticking to its thesis that interest rates on this side of the ditch\\u00a0will not likely rise until 2024, despite bank economists predicting that wages will rise faster than the central bank is expecting and could force its hand sooner.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Why bank economists think the RBA will move on rates by 2023</div>\", \"The Commonwealth Bank predicts Australian house prices will\\u00a0be about 7 per cent higher before a 10 per cent drop in 2023.\", \"Key to CBA's\\u00a0forecast is that the Reserve Bank of Australia\\u00a0will move on lifting the cash rate to at least 1.25 per cent by the third quarter of 2023.\", \"<img

rising,\\\" the bank noted\\u00a0in the recent\\u00a0report.\", \"\\\"That is the place we believe we are moving towards over the next two years given our expectation for the RBA to commence normalising the cash rate in late 2022.\\\"\", \"Its report predicted\\u00a0that the economy will be at full employment by the third quarter of 2023, and that annual wages growth will have pushed to the RBA's desired 3 per cent range, forcing the central bank to lift the cash rate.\", \"CBA's report also argued\\u00a0the return of migration will lift\\u00a0demand for inner-city apartments more than standalone housing initially.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"A\\u00a0lift in population growth as the international border reopens will boost the underlying demand for bricks and mortar, particularly inner city apartments,\\\" it noted.\", \"\\\"As such, we expect house prices to decline by a little more than apartment prices over 2023.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Reserve Bank says there may not be a rate hike before 2024</div>\", \"But RBA governor Philip Lowe last week all but ruled out a cash rate hike in 2022, saying that wages growth would remain slow, and therefore it is\\u00a0unlikely the

repeat a point I made a couple of weeks ago \\u2013 that is, the latest data and forecasts do not warrant an increase in the cash rate in 2022,\\\" Dr Lowe said at the Australian Business Economists lunch last week.\", \"\\\"The economy and inflation would have to turn out very differently from our central scenario for the board to consider an increase in interest rates next year.\\\"\", \"Dr
