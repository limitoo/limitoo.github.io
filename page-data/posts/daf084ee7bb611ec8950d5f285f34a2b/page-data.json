He's still searching for justice.","country":"nz","create_time":"2022-01-22T11:10:19.000Z","content":"[\"An Auckland man who was wrongly detained, strip-searched and badly injured by police during an unlawful arrest more than two-and-a-half years ago has shared footage of his ordeal.\", \"Traffic camera video of the arrest was released to Daniel Bond by police late last year, around the time he filed charges against nine of the officers involved in the incident.\", \"The footage provides a clearer picture of the events of the night of May 2, 2019, showing how a couple of quiet drinks with a friend descended into chaos and how police got things so badly wrong.\", \"The incident kicked off when a sergeant saw Bond outside a vehicle in a slip lane in Browns Bay, on Auckland's North Shore, with a can of bourbon in hand. He was mistakenly suspected of drink-driving and the sergeant, incorrectly applying the law, tried to arrest him.\", \"After refusing to give his details, which he was within his rights to do, he can be seen backing away from police onto the road. Officers then place him under arrest and a melee erupts as the sergeant calls for backup.\", \"The video shows the situation quickly devolving as Bond is swarmed by six officers and forcefully pinned against a police car, then dragged to the ground before being placed in the back of a police van.\", \"Bond says officers roughed him up to such an extent he was left with a concussion and a neck compression fracture, and his phone was also smashed in the fracas. An investigation later found officers had used excessive force.\", \"After Bond was placed in the van, officers equipped with torches can be seen searching two vehicles without a warrant, and his dogs were impounded - neither of which should ever have happened.\", \"After being taken from the scene, Bond was transported to a police station where he was forcibly placed in a tear-resistant gown and strip-searched, despite his protestations.\", \"He was released on bail and subsequently charged with obstructing and assaulting police, however a decision was later made to withdraw the charges.\", \"Bond filed 23 charges in the North Shore District Court against nine different officers last October. The charges are now before a judge for consideration.\", \"Among them is one of assault with a weapon for the officer's use of pepper spray, and five of injuring with intent for the injuries he sustained during his arrest.\", \"Bond has also filed four charges of making an intimate visual recording, as it's alleged police stripped him naked in a room where a CCTV camera was present; and nine of kidnapping, in relation to his unlawful detainment.\", \"The charges come after 30 months of frustration for Bond. Despite the police admitting officers got it wrong that night, he has felt let down by their inaction and is still searching for answers.\", \"An investigation into the incident by police conceded the officers involved made multiple errors, and they apologised to Bond for his experience. However a follow-up investigation by watchdog the Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA) found multiple deficiencies in the police investigation.\", \"The IPCA disagreed with the police's findings on the force used to arrest Bond, the damage caused to his cellphone and the warrantless search of two vehicles following his arrest.\", \"\\\"There is no allowance under the Crimes Act for force to be used except to execute a lawful arrest... We think that, as the arrest was deemed unlawful, any subsequent use of force by Police was not only unlawful but also unjustified,\\\" IPCA Chair Judge Colin Doherty wrote.\", \"\\\"You were being unlawfully detained and were therefore entitled to resist by pulling away and struggling to get free from police. It was not reasonable for police to respond to this reasonable resistance with force.\\\"\", \"The IPCA also found the police should have proactively offered Bond compensation for his damaged cellphone, and should have considered whether the officers were \\\"criminally responsible\\\" for the force they used.\", \"The IPCA raised these issues with police, but the police told them they didn't agree. As the agency has no power to require police to alter their investigation or the outcomes reached, nothing changed.\", \"In a statement in October 2021, police told Newshub its employment investigation was \\\"thorough\\\" and the incident had been addressed adequately with staff. A criminal investigation was never launched as the police's professional conduct team didn't deem it necessary.\", \"They said at the time, they believed the arrest to be lawful and therefore were acting in good faith. However they acknowledge that an incorrect decision was made to place the man in a tear resistant gown when he arrived at the custody unit and therefore the use of force was not justified.\", \"Victim Support was also never offered to Bond because he \\\"was not considered a victim under the Victim's Rights Act 2002\\\".\"]","href_hash":"daf084ee7bb611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"daf084ee7bb611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
