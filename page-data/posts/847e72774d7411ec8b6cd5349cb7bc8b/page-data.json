They asked to see the video of Mr. Arbery\\u2019s killing again, three more times.\", \"The graphic cellphone video of the killing, filmed by William Bryan as he pursued Mr. Arbery in his truck, brought the world\\u2019s attention to the case in the months after the incident.\", \"It sparked nationwide protest and prompted the State Legislature to make significant changes to Georgia criminal law, including passage of the state\\u2019s first hate crimes statute. It propelled the indictment of the former county district attorney on charges including that she directed police officers not to arrest Travis McMichael, who shot Mr. Arbery.\", \"And ultimately, the video appeared to play a crucial role in the jury\\u2019s decision on Wednesday to convict Mr. Bryan, along with Travis McMichael and his father, Gregory McMichael, of murder.\", \"\\u201cThe defendant\\u2019s own video shows that Mr. Arbery wasn\\u2019t armed, that he was jogging,\\u201d said Sarah Gerwig-Moore, a professor at Mercer University School of Law in Macon, Ga. \\u201cIt shows that he was fighting for his life.\\u201d\", \"The ubiquity of cellphone videos from bystanders and body camera videos from police officers has elevated video evidence to the center of many recent trials, often superseding other ways of convincing juries, including witness testimony and lawyers' arguments.\", \"\\u201cWe lawyers, we don\\u2019t have a lock on the story anymore,\\u201d said Mary Fan, a professor of law at the University of Washington and a former prosecutor. \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t matter how dramatically I do my openings or closing or how my witnesses tell their accounts, because the jury is going to look at the visual evidence and my words are just going to be words. I can never match the drama of a video.\\u201d\", \"In the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, which ended in a decision of not guilty just days before the verdict in the Arbery killing case, the defense\\u2019s argument centered on bystander videos of the moments before the first shooting. That footage appeared to show that Mr. Rittenhouse was chased into a parking lot by Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man he shot and killed, which defense lawyers said supported their argument that Mr. Rittenhouse had acted reasonably in self-defense.\", \"It was a cellphone video of George Floyd\\u2019s death under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer \\u2014 captured and uploaded to Facebook by a then 17-year-old bystander \\u2014 that ignited international protests over racism and police violence. The video was critical in the trial that found the former officer, Derek Chauvin, guilty on two counts of murder.\", \"Some legal experts said that videos offer objectivity, especially when compared with testimony, which can be unreliable.\", \"\\u201cWhat you are doing in a trial is you are trying to put the jury in that time, that place and in those circumstances that the witness is testifying about,\\u201d Melissa Redmon, assistant professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, said. \\u201cWhen you have a visual aid to do that, it makes it just much easier.\\u201d\", \"But as video evidence plays an increasingly bigger role in jury deliberations, some experts warn that it can be prone to some of the same vulnerabilities as other forms of evidence.\", \"\\u201cWhen we see video, it has this kind of seductive way of making us think, \\u2018Hey, I\\u2019ve seen what happened,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Fan said. But just as with other types of evidence, it can fail to capture the full picture. Depending on a person\\u2019s prior background, she added, that same footage leads our eyes to \\u201cfollow different details, we notice different things, amplify different things,\\u201d leading juries to fill in the gaps in the story \\u201cin very different ways.\\u201d\", \"Jack Rice, a criminal defense attorney based in St. Paul, Minn., said the outcome of a case often comes down to which side\\u2019s lawyers can lead the jury to view the video in a way that is favorable to their argument.\", \"\\u201cThe undeniable nature of video means that if you can turn it to support your narrative, it could very well make your narrative undeniable,\\u201d he said. \\u201cFrom an advocacy standpoint, that is magnificent. You can\\u2019t ask for more than that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"847e72774d7411ec8b6cd5349cb7bc8b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"847e72774d7411ec8b6cd5349cb7bc8b"}},
