The testimonies, from Representatives Cori Bush of Missouri, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Barbara Lee of California, were all deeply moving in their own way. But one moment from that day stood out to me the most. \\u201cToday I share for the first time publicly a very difficult personal story, hoping that it will help destigmatize accessing abortion care,\\u201d said Ms. Lee. \\u201cI\\u2019m sharing my story even though I truly believe it is personal, and really nobody\\u2019s business.\\u201d\", \"The congresswoman is right \\u2014 abortion is a personal issue, and deciding whether or not to have one need be the business of only the people who are pregnant, and perhaps their trusted partners, family members and doctors. And yet sharing these stories that so often go unspoken can have a profound effect. That\\u2019s why Ms. Lee and her colleagues chose to share theirs. And it\\u2019s why abortion storytelling, more broadly, has become such a potent form of advocacy: because it helps humanize an issue that is so often reduced to slogans and political talking points. That\\u2019s never been more true than now, with the Supreme Court set to decide this term if Roe v. Wade should stay intact.\", \"Of course no two abortion stories are the same because no two lives are the same. But we do know that these stories are common \\u2014 much more so than a lot of people realize because of the shame and stigma surrounding the issue. Nearly one in four U.S. women will have an abortion by age 45. Others will consider having a termination but decide against it. Many will have no choice in the matter, either because of restrictive laws, financial hardship or a tragic fetal anomaly.\", \"Perhaps you have such a story to share. If you or a partner have had, or considered having, an abortion, we\\u2019d be honored if you\\u2019d tell us about the experience in your own voice. We plan to publish a selection of your stories in a future New York Times Opinion project, one that we hope will present the diverse experiences of those personally affected by this hot-button political issue.\", \"To share your story, leave us a voice mail message at (405) 804-1422\\u202c, or record a voice memo and email it to opinioncomments@nytimes.com. In the message, please include your name, age, where you live and the best way for us to contact you in case we need to follow up with you. We understand that these stories are highly personal and will not publish any of your personal information without your consent.\", \"The questions below can serve as prompts when deciding which aspects of your experience to share:\"]","href_hash":"66a439bc3e5011ecba5fa11a6fd972b7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"66a439bc3e5011ecba5fa11a6fd972b7"}},
