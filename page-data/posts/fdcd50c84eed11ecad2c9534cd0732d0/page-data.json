Interrupting these abstract forms are five red birds, flattened and simplified into icons of a new age. Their wings are jazzily misaligned. Their napes are festooned with triangular plumage as consistent as the teeth of a comb.\", \"This isn\\u2019t a painting. It\\u2019s a pillow: something beautiful and practical, something new for the eyes but fit for the head.\", \"Modern art, right on your sofa! Opening after a year\\u2019s pandemic-obliged delay, \\u201cSophie Taeuber-Arp: Living Abstraction\\u201d offers a view of an artist who could not have cared less about the distinctions among the art on your wall, in your living room, on the stage, or on your back. Freewheeling and alive with color, the show puts Taeuber-Arp in her rightful place as a prime mover among the Dadaists of wartime Zurich. It intermingles her abstract watercolors and painted wood sculptures with necklaces, marionettes, beaded purses, stained-glass windows. She could do it all, and was underestimated for decades because of it.\", \"Her multimedia appetite makes her the ideal subject for a blowout in MoMA\\u2019s expanded home, where curators now mix painting, photography, design and even cinema into single presentations. The show, exquisite if unbalanced, has arrived here from the Kunstmuseum Basel and Tate Modern in London. It sure is big, with more than 300 objects on loan from 50 collections. Maybe even too big? There are some longueurs in its later galleries, replete with dozens of later abstract paintings and reliefs: so many dancing circles, so many boogieing lines.\", \"It\\u2019s also weirdly fainthearted about her art\\u2019s sources, notably its clear debts to Native American textiles and African sculpture: influences shared by many of the anarchic rule-breakers of Dada, which plunge her colors and patterns into dialogue with colonialism and ethnography. There\\u2019s so much to fancy here, and I bet \\u201cLiving Abstraction\\u201d will sire scads of younger Sophie stans. But might it have done with a little more grit on this score?\", \"She\\u2019s never been an obscure figure, exactly. She was a regular at the Cabaret Voltaire, dancing and drinking alongside Tristan Tzara, Hugo Ball, and her future husband, the artist and poet Jean (Hans) Arp. Her face used to be on the 50-franc note in Switzerland, wearing a cloche hat that made her look uncannily like one of her own symmetrical, turned-wood Dada Heads. (She got phased out last decade, replaced on the 50 by some Alps and a dandelion.)\", \"She isn\\u2019t even new to MoMA: Taeuber-Arp had a smaller retrospective here back in 1981, and featured in the museum\\u2019s 2006 Dada exhibition and 2012 show \\u201cInventing Abstraction.\\u201d Too often, though, she\\u2019s been relegated to the minor leagues of art history, not only on account of her sex (and her famous husband). For a long stretch of the 20th century, in New York especially, critics and curators maintained that a work of art succeeded most when it fully manifested its \\u201cmedium specificity,\\u201d as the critic Clement Greenberg had it.\", \"Any suggestion that an abstract canvas shared DNA with textiles, furniture design or the \\u201cminor arts\\u201d was therefore anathema. The biggest insult you could deliver to an abstract painter was that his art \\u2014 I use the pronoun advisedly \\u2014 was \\u201cdecorative.\\u201d How could a painting express our highest ideals if it could also provide the pattern for a lady\\u2019s handbag?\", \"But there was a whole other strand of modernism, where women were far better represented, that commingled painting and sculpture with the decorative arts. Those obtuse triangles she wove for that must-have pillow appear too in tender gouaches on paper, locking into gray and salmon parallelograms like the teeth of a zipper. A lovely painting that syncopates rectangles of black, red and teal hangs here next to a larger weaving with the same geometric arrangement. The painting obeys the right-angled grid of the loom\\u2019s warp and weft. Yet the painting isn\\u2019t just a preparation for the tapestry, nor is the tapestry just a translation of the painting.\", \"What Taeuber-Arp saw was that abstract forms could serve as coequal elements in a single creative system. They could be modular, and shape-shifting; forms could migrate at will. Ceiling murals she designed for the Aubette cultural center in Strasbourg have the same gridded structure as her textiles, which themselves echo the grids of the paintings.\", \"And for her this cross-media commitment had an ethical and spiritual dimension. \\u201cIn our complicated times,\\u201d Taeuber-Arp wrote in 1922, \\u201cwhy conceive ornaments and color combinations when there are so many more practical and especially more necessary things to do?\\u201d For her the answer lay not outside but inward, in a \\u201cdeep and primeval urge to make the things we own more beautiful.\\u201d\", \"Taeuber-Arp came to this all-media approach right out of her teens, when she left Switzerland to study at one of the most progressive art schools in Europe: the Debschitz School in Munich, where a majority-female student body learned fine and applied arts together. Returning to Zurich in 1914, she established a craft business, began teaching, and also enrolled in dance courses with Rudolf von Laban.\", \"She\\u2019d come back to Switzerland to escape the war, and soon a bunch of foreigners did the same. As World War I pulverized any last European claims to civilization, these expat artists turned Zurich into a compression chamber of Western insanity, baptized with the nonsense name Dada. Taeuber-Arp, Dada\\u2019s only Swiss member, threw herself into its satirical indictments, above all through the most delightful objects here: loose-limbed, pared-down marionettes from a parodic play, \\u201cKing Stag,\\u201d in the form of courtiers and palace guards, parrots and deer, and kings of the unconscious named Freudanalyticus and Dr. Oedipus Complex.\", \"The marionettes are wonderful relics of Dada diversions. They are also sculptures, self-evidently inspired by the stylized geometric forms of Central African statuary \\u2014 as are the rounded Dada Heads, her substitute self-portraits, which appear like Congolese or Gabonese masks rotated around a central axis. There\\u2019s not a word in any wall text here about Africa or Indigenous America (as well as Swiss folk art, another influence); from the title on, MoMA focuses on abstraction above all. Yet as I moved forward, the show\\u2019s indifference to her cross-cultural influences started to feel more like a conspiracy of silence than a choice of emphasis.\", \"Only one photograph survives of Taeuber-Arp dancing, wearing a geometric mask at one of many Dada wild nights where Europeans chanted in fake African languages and performed bogus tribal dances. The curators call the mask \\u201cCubist-inspired,\\u201d and bury the photo on a four-inch card hung below eye level.\", \"Taeuber-Arp\\u2019s ornamented necklaces strongly recall Zulu beadwork; fringed textiles share the color schemes and geometric patterns with those of the southwest United States; this all passes without notice. The silence gets weirder when you consider that Walburga Krupp, one of the curators of MoMA\\u2019s current show, scrutinized Taeuber-Arp\\u2019s passion for Native American textiles in the catalog of \\u201cDada Africa,\\u201d a rigorous exhibition of Dada and non-Western art seen in Zurich, Berlin and Paris in 2016-17. (The other curators here are Anne Umland of MoMA, \\u200b\\u200bEva Reifert of Basel, and Natalia Sidlina of the Tate.)\", \"Indeed, some of Taeuber-Arp\\u2019s most widely known works before this show were costumes whose geometric patterns she modeled after Hopi katsina dolls \\u2014 ones that Carl Jung, her fellow Swiss, bought on a trip to New Mexico. The costumes appear on the cover of the \\u201cDada Africa\\u201d catalog; one was on display just this summer in \\u201cWomen in Abstraction,\\u201d at the Centre Pompidou. But they\\u2019re not here in New York, nor in MoMA\\u2019s publication. Only the most attentive reader will find, buried in footnotes, a disclosure that the garments \\u201chave been omitted from this publication out of respect for the Hopi and Pueblo peoples.\\u201d\", \"Forgive me, I\\u2019m really not one for cancel-culture bromides, but we\\u2019re in serious trouble if our leading museum of modern and contemporary art thinks it\\u2019s necessary to hide the colonial inspirations of European art from its visitors \\u2014 or, worse, thinks its visitors aren\\u2019t sophisticated enough to recognize them. (The images are already widely published; Hopi art lovers have Google, too.) Umland, the MoMA curator, told me that the pseudo-Hopi textiles were \\u201cnot essential to the thesis of the exhibition,\\u201d even as she conceded that \\u201cthe important reason stated in the catalog\\u201d weighed on their decision too.\", \"I wonder. The abstract impulse that Taeuber-Arp brought to her art and life wasn\\u2019t only about color and line. Her \\u201cdeep and primeval urge\\u201d proceeded straight through colonial anthropology and ethnography. Instead of hushing that up or standing in judgment, why not analyze it, historically, with all the intellectual tools these Europeans didn\\u2019t have and voices they couldn\\u2019t hear? Nearly 40 years after its notorious exhibition on \\u201cprimitive\\u201d art and its modernist influence, has MoMA really not come up with a better approach to this period than concealment?\", \"As it is this show is almost too beautiful, and in its later stretches we encounter acres of refined abstractions that the artist painted in France in the 1930s, saturated with floating circles, rectangles, squiggles and half-moons. When war came a second time, and canvases became harder to procure, she made smaller but no less ambitious drawings, where sidewinding squiggles face off with hard-edged angles. Back in Switzerland in 1943 she stayed for the night at her friend Max Bill\\u2019s house; she lit a fire in the guest bedroom, failing to notice the stove\\u2019s flue was closed, and never woke up. She was 53.\", \"The density of crosses and curves has a clear aim. They\\u2019re here in force to establish the artist as a modernist of the first importance \\u2014 a modernist of MoMA caliber. In this \\u201cLiving Abstraction\\u201d succeeds totally, and Sophie Taeuber-Arp seems almost a self-contained paradigm of this museum\\u2019s recent reinvention: an artist who could make abstraction into a high calling, in fine and applied arts equally. She also has her place in a more global museum, where pictures and people shuttle through endless encounters and no abstraction is pure.\"]","href_hash":"fdcd50c84eed11ecad2c9534cd0732d0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fdcd50c84eed11ecad2c9534cd0732d0"}},
