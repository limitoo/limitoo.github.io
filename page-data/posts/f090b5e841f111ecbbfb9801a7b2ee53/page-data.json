The government's climate advisory Climate Change Committee also worries that allowing this mine to open would cause more problems.\", \"It says to meet its carbon-cutting timetable, steel firms must stop burning coal by 2035 - unless they fit expensive technology to capture emissions and bury them underground.\", \"The committee points out that 85% of the Cumbrian coal will be exported anyway, and every extra tonne of coal on the world market will tend to drive down the cost and drive up emissions. \", \"The UK is currently holding the critical COP26 climate summit and some members fear the mine row will undermine its leadership.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Does the UK steel industry need Cumbrian coal?</div>\", \"This is a controversial issue and few in the industry are prepared to speak publicly. \", \"One said a supply of Cumbrian coal would allow his firm to save some cash by making more flexible orders. But he, and other industry figures I approached, said there were reliable supplies of suitable coal on the world market, and that Cumbrian coal was not essential for their business. \", \"They also think investors will want to put money into clean steel production in future.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What are the alternatives to coal for the steel industry?</div>\", \"Steel-making is a problem area for climate change, but firms are developing technologies like electric arc furnaces - which melt down recycled steel - and hydrogen, which can be used to make steel for cars. \", \"Supporters of the mine say coal will definitely be needed for steel after the climate committee's 2035 deadline. \", \"But the European steel industry, Eurofer, told me clean steel technologies might be available by then - so long as governments support research and development, and block unfair competition from dirty steel imports. \", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What about the jobs? </div>\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/147D0/production/_116902938_gettyimages-501863270.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Miners embracing</div>\", \"The firm says the mine will create 500 jobs, but sceptics think that's exaggerated. \", \"Unemployment in the area is lower than the national average, but over 40 Conservative MPs have signed a letter in support of the mine.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Are other countries facing the same dilemmas?</div>\", \"Every nation accepts that carbon emissions should be cut immediately. But countries with valuable fossil fuel reserves don't want to abandon them and the jobs they sustain - even if renewable technologies may create more jobs elsewhere.\", \"This applies to China and the US - where President Biden has not banned fracking. The UK is phasing out coal for electricity from 2024 but ministers suggest there's still a case for producing suitable coal for steel. \", \"The issue is embarrassing for the UK, because it initiated the global \\\"Powering Past Coal\\\" alliance of countries seeking to persuade others to swap jobs in coal for jobs in clean sectors. \", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What happens now?</div>\", \"Cumbria County Council had originally backed plans for the new mine, but decided in February to review its decision.\", \"An inquiry closed in October, but a final decision is not expected until the new year. \", \"Under planning law Mr Gove is supposed to make that decision without referring to his colleagues.
