According to U.S. Capitol police, stationed officers \\\"spotted an image of a handgun in a bag on the X-ray screen\\\" after he went through security, leading to his arrest four minutes later. Allsbrooks is charged with carrying a pistol without a license.\", \"The Capitol police are trying to figure out how Allsbrooks was able to proceed into the building with the gun in his bag. Although they did not reveal the extent of their investigation, officers said they were \\\"looking into what happened before, during and after those four minutes.\\\"\", \"The incident is one of many that have plagued the U.S. Capitol this year, the most prominent of which was the riot on January 6. Numerous police officers were injured during the incident and one, Brian Sicknick, died one day later after suffering two strokes. Four other officers committed suicide in the weeks and months following the riot.\", \"Another officer died on April 2 when a car was rammed into a barricade outside the Capitol. One officer suffered injuries but recovered. In August, a man claimed he had explosives in his parked truck outside the Library of Congress, leading to nearby evacuations.
