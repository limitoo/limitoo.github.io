In Australia, billabongs form seasonally, filling with water but then drying up as temperatures rise.\", \"Guida said billabongs can dry up very quickly if they are shallow.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942135/bull-shark.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The baby bull shark was found over 30 miles from the nearest coast. </div>\", \"He posted the pictures of the bull shark to Twitter, saying: \\\"You know life on earth is extreme when you find a baked baby bull shark in a remote, isolated & shrinking billabong that's km's from the main river & some 80km upstream from the coast.\\\"\", \"Bull sharks spend the first few years of their lives in rivers in tropical and subtropical parts of the world. They move out to sea as they get older, but return to river systems to give birth. They can exist for long periods in freshwater.\", \"Guida said that based on its size, this bull shark was one year old at most. They are between 1.5 and 2 feet when they are born and can reach up to 11 feet when fully grown.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942139/bull-shark.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">It is thought the shark got stuck in a billabong that dried up as temperatures in Australia increased. </div>\", \"Finding one in this condition, he said, was unusual. \\\"Any other time I've seen any kind of shark dried up it's either been decomposing on a beach somewhere or in a market.\\\" he said. \\\"When you think of how remote and far from the coast this bull shark is, you realize it's quite an amazing example of nature at her most extreme in nearly every sense.\\\"\", \"Bull sharks are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List and their population is decreasing. The biggest threats facing them are commercial and recreational fishing. The Australian government also permits their killing as part of protection programs for bathers.\", \"However, the species is also at risk from climate change and human influence on the landscape. \\\"In northern Australia in particular, there are currently proposals to extract floodplain waters to support farming and mining industries,\\\" Guida said. \\\"Alterations to water flows and regimes, compounded by the effects of climate change, are going to ultimately affect how much and for how long suitable habitat is available.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"879e1a4a51c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"879e1a4a51c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}},
