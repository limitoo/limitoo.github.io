It was the fifth win for Team Penske, which has won three of the last six runnings of what had traditionally been a warmup for the Daytona 500.\", \"Nothing learned in Los Angeles will transfer into the Feb. 21 season-opening Daytona 500, but the race was the first for NASCAR's new car.

The Next Gen didn't disappoint in its debut on the shortest track on the NASCAR schedule.\", \"Tickets to the event ranged from $65 to $145, a cost well worth it to people who have never had the opportunity to experience an event like this.\", \"\\\"You gotta keep up with the times! I mean everything's booming in L.A.,\\\" another fan who took advantage of the chance said to CBS L.A. \\\"That's why we're here!\\\"\", \"Face echoed that, noting that it was well worth the hours-long drive, \\\"It's a one-off, you don't know if they're gonna do it again.
