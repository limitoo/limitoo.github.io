He was 91.\", \"His lawyer and friend, F. Richard Pappas, announced the death. He said he did not know the cause but added that Mr. Sondheim had not been known to be ill and that the death was sudden. The day before, Mr. Sondheim had celebrated Thanksgiving with a dinner with friends in Roxbury, Mr. Pappas said.\", \"An intellectually rigorous artist who perpetually sought new creative paths, Mr. Sondheim was the theater\\u2019s most revered and influential composer-lyricist of the last half of the 20th century, if not its most popular.\", \"His work melded words and music in a way that enhanced them both. From his earliest successes in the late 1950s, when he wrote the lyrics for \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d and \\u201cGypsy,\\u201d through the 1990s, when he wrote the music and lyrics for two audacious musicals, \\u201cAssassins,\\u201d giving voice to the men and women who killed or tried to kill American presidents, and \\u201cPassion,\\u201d an operatic probe into the nature of true love, he was a relentlessly innovative theatrical force.\", \"The first Broadway show for which Mr. Sondheim wrote both the words and music, the farcical 1962 comedy \\u201cA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,\\u201d won a Tony Award for best musical and went on to run for more than two years.\", \"In the 1970s and 1980s, his most productive period, he turned out a series of strikingly original and varied works, including \\u201cCompany\\u201d (1970), \\u201cFollies\\u201d (1971), \\u201cA Little Night Music\\u201d (1973), \\u201cPacific Overtures\\u201d (1976), \\u201cSweeney Todd\\u201d (1979), \\u201cMerrily We Roll Along\\u201d (1981), \\u201cSunday in the Park With George\\u201d (1984) and \\u201cInto the Woods\\u201d (1987).\", \"In the history of the theater, only a handful could call Mr. Sondheim peer. The list of major theater composers who wrote words to accompany their own scores (and vice versa) is a short one \\u2014 it includes Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Frank Loesser, Jerry Herman and No\\u00ebl Coward.\", \"Though Mr. Sondheim spent long hours in solitary labor, usually late at night, when he was composing or writing, he often spoke lovingly of the collaborative nature of the theater. After the first decade of his career, he was never again a writer for hire, and his contribution to a show was always integral to its conception and execution. He chose collaborators \\u2014 notably the producer and director Hal Prince, the orchestrator Jonathan Tunick and later the writer and director James Lapine \\u2014 who shared his ambition to stretch the musical form beyond the bounds of only entertainment.\", \"Mr. Sondheim\\u2019s music was always recognizable as his own, and yet he was dazzlingly versatile. His melodies could be deceptively, disarmingly simple \\u2014 like the title song of the unsuccessful 1964 musical \\u201cAnyone Can Whistle,\\u201d \\u201cOur Time,\\u201d from \\u201cMerrily,\\u201d and the most famous of his individual songs, \\u201cSend In the Clowns,\\u201d from \\u201cNight Music\\u201d \\u2014 or jaunty and whimsical, like \\u201cEverybody Ought to Have a Maid,\\u201d from \\u201cForum.\\u201d\", \"They could also be brassy and bitter, like \\u201cThe Ladies Who Lunch,\\u201d from \\u201cCompany,\\u201d or sweeping, like the grandly macabre waltz \\u201cA Little Priest,\\u201d from \\u201cSweeney Todd.\\u201d And they could be desperately yearning, like the plaintive \\u201cI Read,\\u201d from \\u201cPassion.\\u201d\", \"He wrote speechifying soliloquies, conversational duets and chattery trios and quartets. He exploited time signatures and forms; for \\u201cNight Music,\\u201d he wrote a waltz, two sarabandes, two mazurkas, a polonaise, an \\u00e9tude and a gigue \\u2014 nearly an entire score written in permutations of triple time.\", \"Over all, he wrote both the music and the lyrics for a dozen Broadway shows \\u2014 not including compendium revues like \\u201cSide by Side by Sondheim,\\u201d \\u201cPutting It Together\\u201d and the autobiographical \\u201cSondheim on Sondheim.\\u201d Five of them won Tony Awards for best musical, and six won for best original score. A show that won neither of those, \\u201cSunday in the Park,\\u201d took the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for drama.\", \"Of the many revivals of his shows, three won Tonys, including \\u201cAssassins\\u201d in 2004, even though it had not previously been on Broadway. (It was presented Off Broadway in 1990.)\", \"In 1993, Mr. Sondheim received the Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime achievement, and in 2015 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama. In 2008, he was given a Tony Award for lifetime achievement, and in 2010, in perhaps the ultimate show business accolade, a Broadway house on West 43rd Street, Henry Miller\\u2019s Theater, was renamed in his honor.\", \"For his 90th birthday in March 2020, a Broadway revival of \\u201cCompany\\u201d was planned, with a woman (played by Katrina Lenk) in the central role of Bobby, but it was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The New York Times published a special section devoted to him, and a virtual concert, \\u201cTake Me to the World: A Sondheim 90th Birthday Celebration,\\u201d was streamed on the Broadway.com YouTube channel, featuring Broadway performers singing his songs.\", \"Mr. Sondheim, who also maintained a home in Manhattan, a townhouse on East 49th Street, had been spending most of his time during the pandemic in Roxbury, in western Connecticut.\", \"But he returned to New York this month to attend revivals of two of his musicals: on Nov. 14, for the opening night of \\u201cAssassins,\\u201d at the Classic Stage Company in Lower Manhattan, and the next night for the long-delayed first preview, since Broadway reopened, of \\u201cCompany,\\u201d also starring Patti LuPone, at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater.\", \"Mr. Sondheim was \\u201cextremely\\u201d pleased by both productions, Mr. Pappas, his lawyer, said.\", \"In addition to his theater work, Mr. Sondheim wrote occasional music for films, including the score for \\u201cStavisky,\\u201d Alain Renais\\u2019s 1974 movie about a French financier and embezzler, and his song \\u201cSooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)\\u201d for Warren Beatty\\u2019s \\u201cDick Tracy\\u201d won an Academy Award in 1991. Six cast albums from his shows won Grammy Awards, and \\u201cSend In the Clowns\\u201d won the Grammy for song of the year in 1975.\", \"With the exception perhaps of \\u201cForum,\\u201d Mr. Sondheim\\u2019s shows had hefty ambitions in subject matter, form or both. \\u201cCompany,\\u201d which was built from vignettes featuring several couples and their mutual single male friend, was a bittersweet reflection on marriage. \\u201cPacific Overtures\\u201d aimed to tell the story of the modernization of Japan from the Japanese perspective. \\u201cSweeney Todd,\\u201d a bloody tale about a vengeful barber in 19th-century London, approached Grand Guignol in tone and opera in staging and scoring. \\u201cThe Frogs,\\u201d which was first performed in the Yale University swimming pool in 1974 (with Meryl Streep in the cast) before it was revised for Broadway in 2004, blended the Greek comedy of Aristophanes with present-day political commentary.\", \"Mr. Sondheim liked to think of himself less as a songwriter than as a playwright, albeit one who wrote very short plays and set them to music. His lyrics, scrupulously literate and resonant with complex ideas or emotional ambivalence, were often impossibly clever but rarely only clever; his language was sometimes erudite but seldom purple. He was a world-class rhyming gymnast, not just at the ends of lines but within them \\u2014 one of the baked dishes on the ghoulish menu in \\u201cSweeney Todd\\u201d was \\u201cshepherd\\u2019s pie peppered with actual shepherd\\u201d \\u2014 and he upheld the highest standards for acceptable wordplay, or at least tried to.\", \"His 2010 artistic memoir, \\u201cFinishing the Hat\\u201d (the name was taken from a song title in \\u201cSunday in the Park\\u201d; a follow-up, \\u201cLook, I Made a Hat,\\u201d came out in 2011), was in many ways a primer on the craft of lyric writing. In it, he took himself to task for numerous sins, including things like adding unnecessary adjectives to fill out lines rhythmically and paying insufficient attention to a melodic line. In the song \\u201cSomewhere\\u201d from \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d for example, the highest note in the opening phrase is on the second beat, which means that in the well-known lyric \\u2014 \\u201cThere\\u2019s a place for us\\u201d \\u2014 the emphasis is on the word \\u201ca.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe most unimportant word in the opening line is the one that gets the most important note,\\u201d he wrote.\", \"In another example from \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d he complained about a stanza from \\u201cAmerica,\\u201d which was sung by a chorus of young Puerto Rican women.\", \"\\u201cWords must sit on music in order to become clear to the audience,\\u201d he said to his biographer Meryle Secrest for her 1998 book, \\u201cStephen Sondheim: A Life.\\u201d \\u201cYou don\\u2019t get a chance to hear the lyric twice, and if it doesn\\u2019t sit and bounce when the music bounces and rise when the music rises, the audience becomes confused.\\u201d\", \"In \\u201cAmerica,\\u201d he added, \\u201cI had this wonderful quatrain that went: \\u2018I like to be in America/OK by me in America/Everything free in America/For a small fee in America.\\u2019 The little \\u2018for a small fee\\u2019 was my zinger \\u2014 except that the \\u2018for\\u2019 is accented and \\u2018small fee\\u2019 is impossible to say that fast, so it went \\u2018For a smafee in America.\\u2019 Nobody knew what it meant!\\u201d\", \"What most distinguished Mr. Sondheim\\u2019s lyrics, however, was that they were by and large character-driven, often probing explorations into a psyche that expressed emotional ambivalence, anguish or deeply felt conflict. In \\u201cSend In the Clowns,\\u201d for example, he couched the famous plaint about missed romantic chances largely in the language of the theater, because the character singing it is an aging actress:\", \"In the title song for \\u201cAnyone Can Whistle,\\u201d he wrote from the point of view of a woman who found it hard to love:\", \"Over the years, many people theorized that \\u201cAnyone Can Whistle\\u201d was a cri de coeur by the author, though Mr. Sondheim denied it. \\u201cTo believe that \\u2018Anyone Can Whistle\\u2019 is my credo is to believe that I\\u2019m the prototypical Repressed Intellectual and that explains everything about me,\\u201d he wrote in \\u201cFinishing the Hat.\\u201d\", \"Still, it\\u2019s true that he lived a largely solitary romantic life for many years.\", \"\\u201cI always thought that song would be Steve\\u2019s epitaph,\\u201d the playwright and director Arthur Laurents, who wrote the book for \\u201cAnyone Can Whistle,\\u201d as well as \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d \\u201cGypsy\\u201d and \\u201cDo I Hear a Waltz?,\\u201d told Ms. Secrest.\", \"For a time in his 60s, Mr. Sondheim shared his Manhattan townhouse with a young songwriter, Peter Jones, and in 2017 he married Jeffrey Romley, who survives him, along with a half brother, Walter Sondheim.\", \"For all these reasons \\u2014 the high-minded ambition, the seriousness of subject matter, the melodic experimentation, the emotional discord \\u2014 Mr. Sondheim\\u2019s shows, though mostly received with critical accolades, were almost never popular hits. He suffered from a reputation that he didn\\u2019t write hummable tunes and that his outlook was austere, if not grim. For some of the same reasons, not all performers were suited to his shows, though over the years several well-known singers became his stalwart interpreters, among them Elaine Stritch, Angela Lansbury, Barbara Cook and Bernadette Peters.\", \"Mr. Sondheim rarely gave audiences the fizzy, feel-good musical experience or the happily resolved narrative that the shows of his predecessors conditioned them to expect. He also didn\\u2019t give them the opulent spectacle, the anthemic score or the melodramatic storytelling that became the dominant musical theater style of the 1980s and \\u201990s with the arrival from Britain of Andrew Lloyd Webber\\u2019s megahits \\u201cCats\\u201d and \\u201cPhantom of the Opera,\\u201d and Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Sch\\u00f6nberg\\u2019s \\u201cLes Mis\\u00e9rables\\u201d and \\u201cMiss Saigon,\\u201d followed by the corporate productions of Disney.\", \"Of the shows for which Mr. Sondheim wrote both music and lyrics, his first, \\u201cForum,\\u201d had the longest Broadway run at 964 performances; his second, \\u201cAnyone Can Whistle,\\u201d lasted nine. \\u201cMerrily We Roll Along,\\u201d a famously problematic adaptation of the Kaufman and Hart reverse-chronology play about how idealistic young artists grow cynical as they age, closed after just 16. But even his successes were barely successful. Most of his Broadway shows, in their initial runs, failed to earn back the money it cost to put them on.\", \"\\u201cI have always conscientiously tried not to do the same thing twice,\\u201d Mr. Sondheim said, reflecting on his career in an interview with The New York Times Magazine in 2000, when he turned 70. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re broken-field running, they can\\u2019t hit you with so many tomatoes. I certainly feel out of the mainstream because what\\u2019s happened in musicals is corporate and cookie-cutter stuff. And if I\\u2019m out of fashion, I\\u2019m out of fashion. Being a maverick isn\\u2019t just about being different. It\\u2019s about having your vision of the way a show might be.\\u201d\", \"Stephen Joshua Sondheim was born on March 22, 1930, in Manhattan, and lived first on the Upper West Side. Herbert Sondheim, his father, was the owner of a dressmaking company; his mother, the former Etta Janet Fox, known as Foxy, worked for her husband as a designer until he left her, when Stephen was 10. He was sent for a time to military school, and later to the George School in Pennsylvania, but until he was 16 Stephen, her only child, lived mostly with his mother, with whom he had a troubled relationship throughout his life. (His father remarried and had two more sons.)\", \"In the years following his parents\\u2019 separation, Mr. Sondheim recalled for his biography, his mother treated him precisely as she had her husband: flirting with him sexually on the one hand, belittling him on the other. As an adult, Mr. Sondheim supported her financially; nonetheless, in the 1970s, the night before she was to have heart surgery, she wrote a letter to her son and had it hand delivered. It read, in part, \\u201cThe only regret I have in life is giving you birth.\\u201d \", \"His mother was, nonetheless, responsible for the most formative relationship of her son\\u2019s life. She was a friend of Dorothy Hammerstein, whose husband was the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II; their son Jamie became friends with young Steve, and when the Hammersteins moved to a Pennsylvania farm, Stephen, who had begun playing the piano at 7, went for a visit and stayed for the summer.\", \"His mother subsequently bought a home nearby, and Stephen was so often at the Hammersteins\\u2019 that he was thought of as a family member. Hammerstein himself became a surrogate father and mentor \\u2014 \\u201cIt was because of my teenage admiration for him that I became a songwriter,\\u201d Mr. Sondheim wrote in \\u201cFinishing the Hat,\\u201d although he later assessed Hammerstein as a lyricist of soaring ability but often flawed work. Hammerstein brutally criticized the boy\\u2019s first musical, written at the George School, as \\u201cthe worst thing I\\u2019ve ever read,\\u201d adding: \\u201cI didn\\u2019t say that it was untalented, I said it was terrible. And if you want to know why it\\u2019s terrible, I\\u2019ll tell you.\\u201d\", \"An afternoon-long tutorial followed, teaching him, by Mr. Sondheim\\u2019s account, more about the craft than most songwriters learn in a lifetime. Hammerstein laid out a path of writing exercises for him: Adapt a good play into a musical; adapt a flawed play into a musical; adapt a story from another medium into a musical; and, finally, write a musical from your own original story. This the young Mr. Sondheim did, a project that carried him through his graduation from Williams College in Massachusetts, where he complemented his theater work with serious composition study under Robert Barrow, an intellectually rigorous specialist in harmony, from whom Mr. Sondheim gleaned the lesson, as he put it, \\u201cthat art is work and not inspiration, that invention comes with craft.\\u201d Mr. Sondheim would later study independently with Milton Babbitt, the avant-garde composer.\", \"Mr. Sondheim\\u2019s first professional show business job was not in the theater at all; through the agency representing Hammerstein, he was hired to write for a 1950s television comedy, \\u201cTopper,\\u201d about a fussbudget banker haunted by a pair of urbane ghosts. (Much later, Mr. Sondheim wrote a whodunit film script, \\u201cThe Last of Sheila,\\u201d with the actor Anthony Perkins; it was produced in 1973 and directed by Herbert Ross.) By the \\u201950s he had become a connoisseur of word games and puzzles, and an inventor of elaborate games. From 1968 to 1969, he created cryptic crosswords for New York magazine.\", \"His affinity for theatrical misdirection and mystery was acknowledged by his friend, the playwright Anthony Shaffer, who based the cunningly vengeful cuckold in his play \\u201cSleuth\\u201d partly on Mr. Sondheim. (The play was once tentatively titled \\u201cWho\\u2019s Afraid of Stephen Sondheim?\\u201d)\", \"Mr. Sondheim was in his early 20s when he wrote his first professional show, a musical called \\u201cSaturday Night,\\u201d which was an adaptation of \\u201cFront Porch in Flatbush,\\u201d a play by Philip G. and Julius J. Epstein. He got the job, to write both words and music, after the composer Frank Loesser turned it down. The show was scheduled to be presented in 1955, but the producer, Lemuel Ayers, died before he had completed raising the money for it, and the production came to a halt. The show was not presented until 1997, by a small company in London; it subsequently appeared in Chicago and finally had its New York premiere in 2000, Off Broadway at the Second Stage Theater.\", \"Mr. Sondheim was loath to take either of his first Broadway gigs, \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d and \\u201cGypsy,\\u201d because he felt he was a composer, not only a lyricist \\u2014 \\u201cI enjoy writing music much more than lyrics,\\u201d he confessed in \\u201cFinishing the Hat.\\u201d But he agreed to both on the advice of Hammerstein, who told him that he would benefit from working with the likes of Bernstein; Laurents (who wrote the book), and the director Jerome Robbins, in the first instance, and from writing for a star like Ethel Merman in the second, even though it was she who had wanted a more experienced Broadway hand, Jule Styne, as the composer.\", \"Only once after \\u201cGypsy\\u201d would Mr. Sondheim write lyrics for another composer: an unhappy collaboration with Richard Rodgers, \\u201cDo I Hear a Waltz?,\\u201d based on Laurents\\u2019s play \\u201cThe Time of the Cuckoo.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Sondheim was asked to take the job by Laurents and by Mary Rodgers, Richard\\u2019s elder daughter, whom he had met as a teenager at the Hammersteins\\u2019 and for whom he had complicated feelings over many years. However, the two men proved antagonistic as writing partners \\u2014 years later Mr. Sondheim was quoted as saying that Hammerstein was \\u201ca man of limited talent and infinite soul\\u201d and Rodgers the reverse \\u2014 and though the show ran for 220 performances in 1965, it never had a Broadway revival, and neither man considered it a success.\", \"The period of Mr. Sondheim\\u2019s greatest work began when Harold Prince became his director. They were old friends, having been introduced by Ms. Rodgers in the late 1940s or early \\u201950s, and Mr. Prince had been the producer of \\u201cWest Side Story.\\u201d He had proved his chops as a director as well, with musical successes like \\u201cShe Loves Me\\u201d (1963) and \\u201cCabaret\\u201d (1966).\", \"Mr. Prince would direct five Sondheim musicals in the 1970s \\u2014 \\u201cCompany,\\u201d \\u201cFollies,\\u201d \\u201cA Little Night Music,\\u201d \\u201cPacific Overtures\\u201d and \\u201cSweeney Todd\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2014 and though not all were commercially successful, they were all innovative, the product of two supremely talented artists whose individually authoritative visions were, for the most part, complementary. As Mr. Prince naturally saw a show\\u2019s big picture, its look and its pace, Mr. Sondheim, who had inherited the Rodgers and Hammerstein belief that the songs are critical elements of the play, pushed the idea further \\u2014 not merely integrating the words and music but imbuing the songs with the concerns of a playwright; that is, providing singers with the material to deepen their character portrayals, and in rehearsals concentrating on their delivery and diction.\", \"The partnership foundered on \\u201cMerrily We Roll Along,\\u201d a show that was hampered in part by the youth of its cast members, who had to play not only young characters but also the disillusioned adults they become, and by Mr. Prince\\u2019s acknowledged failure to find an appropriate look for the show as a whole.\", \"\\u201cI never knew how to direct it because I work so much from \\u2018What is it going to look like?\\u2019 \\u201d Mr. Prince told Ms. Secrest for her Sondheim biography. \\u201cThat becomes the motor of the show. I never could figure it out.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMerrily\\u201d has had several lives since then, Off Broadway, in regional theater and overseas, as producers and directors have tried to solve its problems and showcase what is generally acknowledged to be a vivid and poignant score.\", \"In any case, the two men parted creative company for more than two decades, not working together again until they hammered out a version of a much-revised musical about a pair of entrepreneurial American brothers in the early 20th century that in other incarnations, before and after, was variously titled \\u201cGold,\\u201d \\u201cWise Guys\\u201d and \\u201cRoad Show.\\u201d Under Mr. Prince, it was called \\u201cBounce,\\u201d and it was produced in 2003 at the Goodman Theater in Chicago and the Kennedy Center in Washington.\", \"During Mr. Prince\\u2019s absence from his creative life, Mr. Sondheim teamed up with a younger collaborator, James Lapine, and together they created the most cerebral works of Mr. Sondheim\\u2019s career. These included \\u201cInto the Woods,\\u201d which reimagined familiar children\\u2019s fairy tales into darker adult fables; \\u201cPassion,\\u201d a nearly operatic meditation on the nature of love; and \\u201cSunday in the Park With George,\\u201d a work whose first act ingeniously creates the artistic process of the painter Georges Seurat as he produces his masterpiece, \\u201cA Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,\\u201d and whose second act jumps ahead a century to illustrate how a contemporary artist makes art in a more consumer-conscious age.\", \"With no dancing and a slim plot, there was little of musical theater convention in the show, but, as Frank Rich wrote in The Times, it was startlingly original and deeply satisfying. \\u201cIt\\u2019s anyone\\u2019s guess whether the public will be shocked or delighted by \\u2018Sunday in the Park,\\u2019 \\u201d Mr. Rich wrote. \\u201cWhat I do know is that Mr. Sondheim and Mr. Lapine have created an audacious, haunting and, in its own intensely personal way, touching work.\\u201d\", \"It was one of Mr. Sondheim\\u2019s most critically admired shows, running for 604 performances. And many critics and other Sondheim-ophiles found in it his most personal statement, as if he had used Seurat\\u2019s view of the artist\\u2019s life as a surrogate for his own. In the show\\u2019s signature song, \\u201cFinishing the Hat,\\u201d faced with the loss of the woman he loves because his devotion to painting has superseded his devotion to her, Seurat offers a sad but forceful paean to the joy of bringing original beauty into the world.
