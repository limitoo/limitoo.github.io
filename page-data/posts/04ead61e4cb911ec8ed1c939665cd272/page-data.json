a couple of years of development, the government is about to introduce its religious discrimination bill. Here's what's in it — and what's not — and what people think of it so far.","country":"au","create_time":"2021-11-23T23:57:04.000Z","content":"[\"The government is about to introduce its religious discrimination bill in an attempt to secure extra protections from state-based discrimination laws.\", \"It's been in the works for a few years now.\\u00a0It was first promised in the wake of the same-sex marriage debate in 2017 and then taken by the Coalition to the last election, with a first draft released in 2019.\", \"After delays, Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected to personally introduce the bill to\\u00a0parliament tomorrow.\", \"Here's a quick look at what's changed in the bill, and what people are saying so far.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What are the main points?</div>\", \"After several drafts, the proposed legislation released yesterday is a watered-down take on earlier versions.\", \"It wants to make sure \\\"statements of belief\\\" are not considered discriminatory, as long as they don't threaten, intimidate, harass or vilify a person or would be\\u00a0considered malicious to a \\\"reasonable person\\\".\", \"But a controversial stronger\\u00a0provision to protect someone from being sacked for expressing any religious belief \\u2014 the so-called Israel Folau clause that was included in an earlier draft \\u2014\\u00a0has been scrapped.\", \"So has a proposal to allow medical workers to refuse treatment to people for religious reasons.\\u00a0\", \"The bill also spells out that religious bodies can \\\"generally\\\" act in accordance with their faith in certain situations without it being discriminatory.\", \"For example, the bill says it wouldn't be discrimination if a religious primary school required all of its students and staff to practise its particular\\u00a0religion,\\u00a0meaning it could turn away people who don't.\", \"The same would apply\\u00a0to other organisations such as\\u00a0religious hospitals, aged care facilities and\\u00a0disability service providers.\", \"But any religious schools or institutions would have to have a publicly available policy that clearly explained\\u00a0how those religious views would be enforced.\", \"Under the law, a\\u00a0religious discrimination commissioner position would also be created and would sit within the Human Rights Commission.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Who's for and against it?</div>\", \"Despite the changes to the legislation, many conservative MPs are happy with the compromises, describing the proposed law\\u00a0as \\\"shield, not a sword\\\".\", \"Wendy Francis from the Australian Christian Lobby, one of the most outspoken groups on the proposal,\\u00a0said the organisation was satisfied with the bill.\", \"But some moderate government MPs have voiced concerns about what giving protections for statements of religious belief might mean in practice, and whether the bill could allow schools to sack gay teachers.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b1ecb76feeab15aae7fae373c767db59\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> LGBTIQ advocacy groups like Equality Australia are concerned the bill would\\u00a0allow discrimination against the queer community.(Kristy Lee: Public Domain)</div>\", \"Equality Australia, an LGBTIQ advocacy organisation, is also worried statements currently considered discriminatory\\u00a0could be protected under the proposed law.\", \"The federal opposition hasn't announced yet whether it'll support the bill,\\u00a0with leader Anthony Albanese saying he hasn't seen it yet.\", \"Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong has said protecting religious freedoms is important but shouldn't come at the cost of reducing protection from other forms of discrimination.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What happens now?</div>\", \"At the moment it looks like the legislation will be introduced this week, and then debated and voted on in the House of Representatives next week.\", \"From there it'll go to the Senate, but it's likely it'll be sent to a committee inquiry, given some of the concerns raised by government and crossbench MPs.\", \"Once that inquiry reports back, it'll go to a final vote, which could happen early next year \\u2014 before the next federal election.\", \"Whether it becomes law is another question, given the bill that gets voted on may end up being different again to what we have now if it's scrutinised by a committee.\", \"If the government holds on to its slim majority in the lower house, then it'll be able to pass it there no worries.\\u00a0\", \"But unless it has the support of Labor or key crossbenchers, the government\\u00a0won't be able to get it through the Senate.\", \"Labor's expressed in-principle support for the idea of protecting religious freedoms\\u00a0but wants to consider the bill before deciding on its stance.\", \"Which senators will back\\u00a0and which will try to\\u00a0block\\u00a0the bill from becoming law should be clearer closer to the vote next year.\"]","href_hash":"04ead61e4cb911ec8ed1c939665cd272"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"04ead61e4cb911ec8ed1c939665cd272"}},
