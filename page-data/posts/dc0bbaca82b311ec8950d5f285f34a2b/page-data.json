Hacker.\", \"\\\"I am asking that you immediately conduct a risk assessment of the Fulton County Courthouse and Government Center, and that you provide protective resources to include intelligence and federal agents,\\\" Willis wrote.\", \"Willis recently won approval to convene a special grand jury to aid her investigation into the former president.

Trump and his associates regarding alleged attempts to improperly influence the administration of Georgia's 2020 General Election.\\\"\", \"Willis has said in interviews that the investigation includes a January 2, 2021, phone call in which Trump told Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, \\\"I just want to find 11,780 votes.\\\" Trump lost the state to President Biden by that margin, and the outcome was affirmed by several recounts.\", \"The district attorney wrote that the grand jury will convene on May 2, adding that her office \\\"will not be influenced or intimidated by anyone as this investigation moves forward.\\\"\", \"A spokesperson for Trump did not reply to a request for comment.\", \"At the rally in Texas on Saturday, Trump also said he would consider pardoning defendants\\u00a0charged in connection with the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, in which throngs of his supporters stormed the building, assaulting police and others.\", \"In another part of his speech cited by Willis, Trump called the prosecutors investigating him \\u2014 in Manhattan for fraud and in Fulton County for election interference \\u2014 \\\"vicious, horrible people.\\\"\", \"\\\"They're racist and they're very sick. They're mentally sick,\\\" Trump said. \\\"They're going after me without any protection of my rights by the Supreme Court or most other courts. In reality they're not after me, they're after you and | just happen to be the person that's in the way.\\\"\", \"The Manhattan investigation was the subject of a landmark Supreme Court decision in July 2020 that affirmed that even sitting presidents can be subject to state criminal subpoenas.
