While we have not heard the entire trial, based on our assessment of Kyle on the stand, we believe that he will be found innocent by the jury.\\\"\", \"Ackman also encouraged others to watch Rittenhouse's testimony and not base their views on the defendant on what they have seen or read in the media during coverage of the highly divisive case.\", \"\\\"With respect to my own political bias, I am not a gun owner, nor a member of the NRA,\\\" he added. \\\"On balance, I support stronger gun regulations and removing loopholes in the sale of guns. Unfortunately, it seems that society's view of Kyle is innocence depends more on one's views about gun control rather than on what actually took place last August.\", \"\\\"Kyle Rittenhouse's life is at risk. Justice demands a fair trial. Society would benefit greatly if politics did not enter the courtroom and convict innocent people.\\\"\", \"Just 20 minutes after sending his last tweet regarding Rittenhouse, Ackman tweeted again to say someone from the media had called him to ask if his Twitter account had been hacked.\", \"\\\"That is, the reporter couldn't conceive of the idea that I could believe that Kyle is innocent because I am not a right winger. Crazy,\\\" Ackman said.\", \"The main outcome of the Rittenhouse trial rests on whether the jury believe that the then 17-year-old was right to shoot and kill his victims during the disorder in Kenosha.\", \"Under Wisconsin law, a person is allowed to use deadly force in self-defense if \\\"necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.\\\"\", \"Rittenhouse's lawyers have argued that the suspect came to Kenosha to provide medical assistance and protect the city from the protesters, and and only fired his semi-automatic rifle while being chased and attacked by an angry mob.\", \"The prosecution argue that Rittenhouse, who is not a trained Emergency Medical Technician [EMT] despite claiming to be, helped to initiate the violence that night and had no legal right to kill or injure his victims.\", \"Ackman has been contacted for further comment.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931402/bill-ackman-rittenhouse.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Bill Ackman, the billionaire founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, claims Kyle Rittenhouse acted in self-defense when he killed two BLM protesters and wounded a third last August.
