Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, Dec. 27-Jan. 2. Details and times are subject to change.\", \"THE LAST BLACK MAN IN SAN FRANCISCO (2019) 6 p.m. on Showtime. A drama that uses surreal imagery to comment on real issues of displacement, gentrification and income inequality, \\u201cThe Last Black Man in San Francisco\\u201d centers on a young man, Jimmie (Jimmie Fails, playing a version of himself), who fights to reclaim his childhood home in a San Francisco transformed by wealth and those who wield it. \\u201cIn moments,\\u201d Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times, \\u201cit feels as if Jimmie and his faithful artistic friend, Montgomery (Jonathan Majors, a mournful heartbreaker), are dreaming the movie into existence, pouring its surrealistic jolts and hallucinatory beauty out of their heads and straight into yours.\\u201d\", \"THE YEAR: 2021 9 p.m. on ABC. This annual year-end recap from ABC might strike some viewers as too daunting \\u2014 this edition focuses on 2021, after all \\u2014 but those in a reflective mood might appreciate the opportunity to look back at some of the biggest world events from the past year. Robin Roberts hosts.\", \"THE SUPER BOB EINSTEIN MOVIE (2021) 9 p.m. on HBO. Revisit the career of the comic actor and writer Bob Einstein, who died in 2019 at 76, in this feature-length documentary. After writing on \\u201cThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\\u201d in the late 1960s, Einstein stepped in front of the camera as the character Super Dave, a parody of stuntmen like Evel Knievel. More recently, Einstein appeared alongside Larry David in \\u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm.\\u201d David pays tribute to Einstein in the documentary, alongside a roster of other interviewees including Steve Martin, David Letterman, Jerry Seinfeld, Rob Reiner, J.B. Smoove and Sarah Silverman. In a succinct description of Einstein\\u2019s magic, Silverman says, \\u201cThe straight man is usually what the funny man bounces off of \\u2014 but he\\u2019s both.\\u201d\", \"MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS (1974) 8 p.m. on TCM. The director Sidney Lumet assembled a train full of famous actors for this classic take on the Agatha Christie story of the same name, about a billionaire\\u2019s on-rails murder. Albert Finney stars as the fictional detective Hercule Poirot, alongside Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, Vanessa Redgrave and Anthony Perkins. Working from a screenplay adapted by Paul Dehn, Lumet fills the story with stylistic nods to classic big-budget Hollywood movies \\u2014 this is a movie that felt old school even in the mid-70s. The result, Bosley Crowther wrote in his 1974 review for The Times, is a \\u201cterrifically entertaining super-valentine\\u201d to classic whodunits.\", \"SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE (2018) 4:30 p.m. on FX. Spider-Man once again proved his moneymaking superpowers this month with \\u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home,\\u201d which brought in the third-highest opening weekend box-office receipts in Hollywood history after a period of moviegoing malaise. But the animated rethink \\u201cInto the Spider-Verse\\u201d is probably still the recent Spidey movie to beat in terms of critical reception. It imagines its hero as a Brooklyn middle schooler named Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) who takes on the bad guys with the help of a group of heroes from different dimensions. In his review for The Times, A.O. Scott called the movie \\u201cfresh and exhilarating.\\u201d\", \"NEW YEAR\\u2019S EVE SHOWS various times on several networks.

The Vienna Philharmonic has long been prized for its warm, traditional \\u201cVienna sound.\\u201d So expect to feel a disorienting sense of timelessness as it performs a New Year\\u2019s program anchored by Strauss waltzes in this celebratory concert. \\u201cIt\\u2019s their obstinacy that has kept them so different, sound-wise, from the other orchestras of the world,\\u201d the conductor Zubin Mehta told The Times in 2014. \\u201cThe oboes, the clarinets, the horns, the trumpets, the timpani are still the same type of instruments that their forefathers used.\\u201d\", \"THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (2016) 9:30 p.m. on Paramount Network. In less time than it takes him to wax poetic about the moral cost of killing in the just-released \\u201cThe Tragedy of Macbeth\\u201d (\\u201cis this a dagger which I see before me?\\u201d), Denzel Washington cuts down a saloon full of bad guys in this western from Antoine Fuqua.

He enlists the help of some other gunslingers, played by the likes of Ethan Hawke and Chris Pratt. It\\u2019s \\u201ca remake of a remake that\\u2019s as fresh as recycled recycling suggests,\\u201d Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. But, she added, Washington \\u201chas that ineluctable what\\u2019s-it for selling the goods no matter what their sell-by date. And he has nice help in his amusing backup team.\\u201d\", \"MASTERPIECE: AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). David Tennant plays the peppy fictional adventurer Phileas Fogg in this new, family-friendly adaptation of the Jules Verne novel.
