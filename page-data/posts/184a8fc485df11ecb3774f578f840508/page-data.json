Several communities detected Omicron in wastewater before any test samples from infected residents showed they had the variant.\", \"\\u201cThese data are uniquely powerful because they capture the presence of infections from people with and without symptoms, and they\\u2019re not affected by access to health care or availability of clinical testing,\\u201d Amy Kirby, the program lead for the National Wastewater Surveillance System, said at a news briefing on Friday.\", \"The C.D.C., which established the system in September 2020, is now funding wastewater surveillance in 37 states, four cities and two territories, Dr. Kirby said. Not all of those jurisdictions have begun reporting data.\", \"The new dashboard, which will be updated daily, provides a color-coded view of how the levels of virus in the wastewater have changed in participating communities over the previous 15 days.\", \"But its coverage is limited, and provides an uneven view of the nation\\u2019s wastewater monitoring efforts. Of the 255 sites currently reporting data, many are concentrated in Wisconsin, Missouri and Ohio. More than a dozen states \\u2014 including Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana \\u2014 are reporting no data at all.\", \"Another 250 sites will be added to the dashboard in the next few weeks, Dr. Kirby said, though even then not all states will be covered.\", \"\\u201cThe real power of this program will be more evident in the coming weeks when hundreds more testing sites will begin submitting data,\\u201d she said.\"]","href_hash":"184a8fc485df11ecb3774f578f840508"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"184a8fc485df11ecb3774f578f840508"}},
