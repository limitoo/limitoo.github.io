He was 64.\", \"His death was confirmed by his publisher, Duke University Press. No cause was given.\", \"Mr. Tate exploded onto the New York cultural scene in the early 1980s, soon after graduating from Howard University, when he began contributing freelance music reviews to The Voice. Although he didn\\u2019t join the weekly newspaper\\u2019s staff until 1987, he almost immediately became its pre-eminent writer on Black music and art, and by extension one of the city\\u2019s leading cultural critics.\", \"New York at the time was an ebullient chaos of cultures, its downtown scene populated by street artists, struggling writers, disco D.J.s and punk rockers living in cheap apartments and crowding into clubs like Paradise Garage and CBGB. The Village Voice was their bible, and Mr. Tate was very often their guide.\", \"His tastes varied widely, as did his style; his whirlwind sentences might string together pop culture, French literary theory and the latest slang. He was equally at home discussing Chuck D or assessing the latest work of the theorist Edward Said, all deployed with a casual candor that left readers wanting more.\", \"He quickly graduated from reviews to cultural criticism. Among his most famous articles was \\u201cCult-Nats Meet Freaky Deke,\\u201d an incisive attempt, published in The Voice in 1986, to find a middle ground between the austere aesthetics of Black nationalist intellectualism and the emancipatory pandemonium of artists like James Brown.\", \"He could be both generous and exacting: He praised Michael Jackson\\u2019s \\u201cThriller\\u201d as one of the best albums ever made while calling the follow-up, \\u201cBad,\\u201d one of the worst, and eviscerating Jackson\\u2019s \\u201cblanched skin and disfigured African features\\u201d as the sad, inevitable result of white America\\u2019s ongoing appropriation of Black culture.\", \"\\u201cJackson was the under-weaned creation of two Black working-class traditions,\\u201d he wrote in The Voice in 1987: \\u201cThat of boys being forced to bypass childhood along the fast track to manhood, and that of rhythm and blues auctioning off the race\\u2019s passion for song, dance, sex and spectacle.\\u201d\", \"But he was less interested in castigation than in celebration and exploration. A single, clear thread ran through all his work: a belief that Black culture was fresh and innovative but at the same time deeply rooted in history, and that its disparate forms could be understood as emanations from a common heritage.\", \"\\u201cI marvel at hip-hop for the same reasons I marvel at Duke Ellington, Ralph Ellison, Malcolm X and Michael Jordan: a lust for that wanton and wily thing called swing and an ardor for Black artists who make virtuosic use of African-American vernacular,\\u201d he wrote in The New York Times in 1994.\", \"Mr. Tate\\u2019s first book, \\u201cFlyboy in the Buttermilk: Essays on Contemporary America,\\u201d was published in 1993. A compendium of his articles from The Voice, it catalyzed a generation of young writers of color with its vivid language, easy erudition and kaleidoscopic range.\", \"\\u201cHis best paragraphs throbbed like a party and chattered like a salon,\\u201d one of those young critics, Hua Hsu, wrote in 2016 in The New Yorker, where he is now a staff writer. \\u201cThey were stylishly jam-packed with names and reference points that shouldn\\u2019t have got along but did.\\u201d\", \"Some critics like to remain aloof from their subjects; not Mr. Tate. He palled around with the rapper Fab Five Freddy and the guitarist Vernon Reid, a founder of the band Living Colour, and he went out of his way to promote rising young Black artists, especially women.\", \"After a series of meetings in 1985 to discuss the racial disparities in New York\\u2019s music scene, he joined Mr. Reid and several others to form the Black Rock Coalition, which promotes Black musicians. Mr. Tate wrote the group\\u2019s manifesto.\", \"\\u201cRock and roll,\\u201d he wrote, \\u201clike practically every form of popular music across the globe, is Black music, and we are its heirs. We, too, claim the right of creative freedom and access to American and International airwaves, audiences, markets, resources and compensations, irrespective of genre.\\u201d\", \"He wrote as both a music fan and a musician; he played guitar, and in 1999 he formed Burnt Sugar the Arkestra Chamber, a genre-blending band of indeterminate size. Anywhere from 12 to 40 members might be onstage at a time, with Mr. Tate often playing the role of conductor.\", \"Mr. Tate left The Voice in 2005. He became a visiting professor at Brown and Columbia and wrote a series of books, including a sequel to \\u201cFlyboy\\u201d and a critical assessment of Jimi Hendrix. Both the pace and the style of his writing slowed down and became more deliberate as he shifted his attention to visual art and national politics.\", \"\\u201cWhen you\\u2019re younger, it\\u2019s all about expressionism, it\\u2019s all about trying to make as much noise as possible,\\u201d he told The L.A. Review of Books in 2018. \\u201cYou realize, after a while, your thoughts are incendiary enough; the language doesn\\u2019t have to also be on fire all the time.\\u201d\", \"Gregory Stephen Tate was born on Oct. 14, 1957, in Dayton, Ohio. Both his parents, Charles and Florence (Grinner) Tate, were active in the city\\u2019s civil rights movement as members of the Congress of Racial Equality, and their home served as a gathering place for fellow organizers.\", \"On weekends, as the family cleaned the house, his father would play jazz albums and his mother would play recordings of speeches by Malcolm X, followed by Nina Simone.\", \"His omnivorous nature emerged early on. His family moved to Washington when he was 13, and among their new friends was the playwright and poet Thulani Davis. In an interview, she remembered Greg coming to her apartment to listen to records and grilling her about music, art and literature. He read Amiri Baraka and Rolling Stone in equal measure.\", \"\\u201cWhen he discovered a new sound or set of ideas,\\u201d Ms. Davis said in an interview, \\u201che would listen to or read them obsessively.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Tate is survived by a daughter, Chinara Tate; a brother, Brian; a sister, Geri Augusto; and a grandson.\", \"He studied journalism and film at Howard, where he also hosted a radio show and began trying his hand at music criticism. Eventually Ms. Davis recommended that he submit something to The Village Voice, whose music editor, Robert Christgau, she knew.\", \"Just before moving to New York permanently, Mr. Tate struck up a friendship with Arthur Jafa, another Howard student, who was at the beginning of his own illustrious career as a video artist. A chance encounter outside the Howard library, just before Mr. Tate moved to Harlem, turned into an eight-hour conversation, ranging over Greek drama, avant-garde film and the latest sounds coming out of New York.\", \"The two remained close, bouncing ideas off each other and becoming famous for their public gab sessions. When Mr. Jafa needed an essay for an exhibition catalog, Mr. Tate wrote it in a night. On another occasion, Mr. Jafa joined Mr. Tate for an event in Minneapolis, where they ended up talking for 10 hours, becoming a sort of accidental performance art.\", \"\\u201cHe didn\\u2019t accept false boundaries,\\u201d Mr. Jafa said in an interview. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to describe what it\\u2019s like having the voice of a generation as your friend.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"2a62080a587a11ecb8fba1e76e4b7a4b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2a62080a587a11ecb8fba1e76e4b7a4b"}},
