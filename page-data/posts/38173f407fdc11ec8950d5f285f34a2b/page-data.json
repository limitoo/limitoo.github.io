The researchers have also, for the first time, incorporated information about land and soil characteristics.\", \"Coffee is the most susceptible crop to high temperatures. In those countries accounting for the majority of the world's production of Arabica - the dominant coffee variety - suitability for growing the crop will decrease by around half by 2050 - a \\\"drastic\\\" reduction, according to the report.\", \"Some key areas will see a heavier impact. In the lowest temperature scenario, there would be a reduction of 76 percent in Brazil's most suitable areas for coffee. In Colombia it would shrink by 63 percent.\", \"Some regions at the northern and southern ends of today's growing areas will become more suitable, including Argentina, South Africa, China and New Zealand among others.\", \"But according to the authors, this doesn't mean that these new regions can easily replace the current sites.\", \"\\\"The key message for those that are in the main producing regions today is that farming systems have to adapt to the changing conditions,\\\" said lead author Roman Gr\\u00fcter, from Zurich University of Applied Sciences.\", \"\\\"If there is already coffee grown in a new area where it is just about possible with some management options, it might get easier or might be possible to expand but it doesn't mean that we will get perfect coffee growing regions within 10 years or so.\\\"\", \"For cashews, the picture is different. Overall, the areas of the world that are highly suitable for growing the crop will increase by 17 percent.\", \"However, in some of the countries that currently reliant on cashews as a key cash crop the news is not good. India loses significant areas of suitability, while Benin loses half its suitable areas under the lowest modelled increase in temperature.\", \"For avocados, the picture is also complicated - especially in the biggest producing countries.\", \"Mexico, the world's largest producer, sees a major increase in suitable lands, up over 80 percent. However, Peru - another major grower - loses around half its suitable areas under the same climate model.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/15062/eight_col_avocado.jpg?1471486745\\\" alt=\\\"no caption\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPhoto: 123rf\\n</div>\", \"While the rise in temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns might make some areas more suitable, the authors are concerned that a major shift to develop these crops in new regions might see more forests converted to farmland or a rise of invasive species.\", \"\\\"In regions that might get more suitable for growing those crops, it is important to make sure that there are no negative environmental impacts such as deforestation,\\\" Gr\\u00fcter said.\", \"\\\"In all of these changes, the local stakeholders, the local communities have to get involved in these changing processes. It should be really participatory.\\\"\", \"While the changing temperatures might seem to be bad news for current growers of these crops, there are some active steps that producers can take that could mitigate climate change.\", \"\\\"It is possible that some regions where avocados are currently grown the use of the genetic variability of avocado might help,\\\" said Dr Joaquin Guillermo Ramirez Gil, from the National University of Colombia, who wasn't involved in the new study.\", \"\\\"This species has three 'races' with different geographical origins, which makes it quite 'plastic' to adapt to different climatic conditions.\", \"\\\"There are also local adaptations and new management alternatives such as the use of bio-stimulants and nanotechnology-based products as a basis for reducing stress due to extreme weather conditions.\\\"\", \"The research has been published in the journal Plos One.\", \"- BBC\"]","href_hash":"38173f407fdc11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"38173f407fdc11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
