Hoffa, who did not seek another five-year term.\", \"The outcome appears to reflect frustration over the union\\u2019s most recent contract with UPS and a growing dissatisfaction with the tenure of Mr. Hoffa, whose father ran the union from 1957 to 1971.\", \"With about 90 percent of the ballots tallied, Mr. O\\u2019Brien had more than two-thirds of the vote in his race against Steve Vairma, a fellow international vice president who had been endorsed by Mr. Hoffa. The election was conducted by mail-in ballots that were due Monday.\", \"Mr. O\\u2019Brien, 49, railed against the contract that the union negotiated with UPS \\u2014 where more than 300,000 Teamsters work \\u2014 for allowing the company to create a category of employees who work on weekends and top out at a lower wage, among other perceived flaws.\", \"\\u201cIf we\\u2019re negotiating concessionary contracts and we\\u2019re negotiating substandard agreements, why would any member, why would any person want to join the Teamsters union?\\u201d Mr. O\\u2019Brien said at a candidate forum in September in which he frequently tied his opponent to Mr. Hoffa.\", \"Mr. O\\u2019Brien has also criticized Mr. Hoffa\\u2019s approach to Amazon, which many in the labor movement regard as an existential threat. Although the union approved a resolution at its recent convention pledging to \\u201csupply all resources necessary\\u201d to unionize Amazon workers and eventually create a division overseeing that organizing, Mr. O\\u2019Brien said the efforts were too late.\"]","href_hash":"692d392548da11ecbfe86d0cb161ab1b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"692d392548da11ecbfe86d0cb161ab1b"}},
