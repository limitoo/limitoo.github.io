That crisis of trust is bigger than just one party \\u2014 both Republican and Democratic voters have expressed doubt in the system.\", \"As people stormed the Capitol last year, Sharon Story and her husband Victor didn't follow the crowd inside.\", \"The grandmother of 10, who had driven all the way from Gaffney, South Carolina, to be there, firmly believes that the American democracy she used to teach about in her sixth grade classroom is on the edge of collapse.\", \"\\\"I think if they push people too far against the wall, especially the Southerners, they're not gonna take it,\\\" Story said when asked if she thought a civil war was possible in her lifetime.\", \"And it's not just Story who worries that.
