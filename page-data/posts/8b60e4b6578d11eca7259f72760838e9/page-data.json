The musical takes place over two days inside a Los Angeles rehearsal studio, where a driven Jackson is in the final stages of rehearsing for his \\u201cDangerous\\u201d world tour.\", \"The show, capitalized for up to $22.5 million, offers context for Jackson\\u2019s creative choices through flashbacks to earlier chapters of his career, most of them prompted by questions from a documentary filmmaker who says she wants to observe Jackson\\u2019s process but turns out to be more interested in signs of trouble.\", \"The musical was announced in the spring of 2018, with a projected arrival on Broadway in 2020. But seven months later, a documentary called \\u201cLeaving Neverland\\u201d premiered at Sundance, bringing renewed attention to allegations, denied by Jackson when he was alive and by his estate since his death, that Jackson had sexually abused children. (The men featured in the documentary declined, through a spokesman, to comment on the musical.)\", \"Shortly after the documentary was first aired, the production canceled a planned pre-Broadway run in Chicago, citing labor woes, and later the musical\\u2019s name was changed, from a potentially problematic \\u201cDon\\u2019t Stop \\u2019Til You Get Enough\\u201d to the simpler \\u201cMJ.\\u201d When the Chicago run was scrapped, the producing team, led by Lia Vollack, announced a plan to bring it to Broadway in the summer of 2020, but then the coronavirus pandemic shut down Broadway. So the show is just getting underway now.\", \"In an interview in April 2019, a month after HBO released the documentary, Nottage and Wheeldon said they remained committed to the project, but were still processing their reactions to the documentary. Neither would say whether they believed Jackson was a child molester, and both said they did not see adjudicating that question as their role.\", \"\\u201cThis is obviously challenging \\u2014 it makes this not without its complications, for sure \\u2014 but part of what we do as artists is we respond to complexity,\\u201d Wheeldon said. He added: \\u201cWe\\u2019re sensitive to what\\u2019s going on and we\\u2019ll see whether it works into the show or not. But the primary focus of our show has always been focusing on Michael\\u2019s creative process.\\u201d\", \"Nottage said she aspired to craft \\u201ca musical that everyone can come to, regardless of how they feel about Michael Jackson.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI see the artwork that we\\u2019re making as a way to more deeply understand Michael Jackson and process feelings,\\u201d she said, \\u201cand ultimately that\\u2019s what theater can do.\\u201d\", \"On Tuesday, asked about the show\\u2019s narrative choices, Rick Miramontez, a spokesman for the musical, noted that Jackson remains \\u201ca global cultural icon,\\u201d and said, \\u201cThe producers hope the work, performance, and storytelling of the show\\u2019s talented Broadway creators, who have collaborated on this production since 2016, will make a valuable contribution to the continuing examination of the artistry, creativity and music of one of the most controversial and consequential artists of the modern era.\\u201d\", \"The musical, which currently features a whopping 37 songs (some performed in their entirety, and others as excerpts), has one reference to concerns about Jackson\\u2019s closeness to children, when one of the singer\\u2019s managers asks another employee \\u201cWho the hell is this family he wants to bring on tour?\\u201d\", \"And then, during a news conference, as reporters pelt Jackson with questions about his surgeries, his skin color, and so on, one asks \\u201cWhat do you have to say about the recent allegations that you \\u2014\\u201d without finishing the thought.\", \"The packed house \\u2014 in the Neil Simon Theater, which seats 1,445 people \\u2014 was rapturous, with audience members leaping to their feet after \\u201cWanna Be Startin\\u2019 Somethin\\u2019\\u201d and \\u201cThriller\\u201d and loudly cheering for familiar songs as well as costume elements (the glove!).\", \"Some ticketholders were dressed in outfits made famous by Jackson \\u2014 there were more than a few \\u201cThriller\\u201d cosplayers \\u2014 or in Jackson concert T-shirts; as the show ended, a toddler danced ecstatically in the orchestra aisle. Miramontez said the attendees came from as far as Hawaii, Croatia and parts of Asia to see the show.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve loved Michael Jackson since I was a little girl \\u2014 his music has always been so inspirational,\\u201d said Jerrell Sablan, a 38-year-old from Jersey City, who wore a shirtdress she had fashioned out of a 4XL men\\u2019s T-shirt featuring images of Jackson at various stages of his career.\", \"Her husband, Will Griffith, 43, was in a full-body candy-apple-red \\u201cThriller\\u201d costume. \\u201cLike her, I grew up with the music.
