South Korea's daily jump in coronavirus infections exceeded 5,000 for the first time since the start of the pandemic as a Delta-driven surge pushed hospitalizations and deaths to record highs. </div>\", \"While about three dozen countries worldwide have reported omicron infections, including India on Thursday, the numbers so far are small outside of South Africa, which is facing a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases and where the new variant may be becoming dominant. Still, much remains unclear about omicron, including whether it is more contagious, as some health authorities suspect, whether it makes people more seriously ill, or whether it can evade vaccine protection.\", \"\\\"The positive news in all of this is that none of the information we have currently about omicron suggests we need to change the directions of our response,\\\" said Kasai.\", \"That means continuing to push for higher vaccination rates, abiding by social-distancing guidelines, and wearing masks, among other measures, said WHO Regional Emergency Director Dr. Babatunde Olowokure.\", \"He added that health systems must \\\"ensure we are treating the right patients in the right place at the right time, and so therefore ensuring that ICU beds are available, particularly for those who need them.\\\"\", \"Kasai warned: \\\"We cannot be complacent.\\\"\", \"WHO has previously urged against border closures, noting they often have limited effect and can cause major disruptions. Officials in southern Africa, where the omicron variant was first identified, have decried restrictions on travelers from the region, saying they are being punished for alerting the world to the mutant strain.\", \"A few countries in Western Pacific region are facing surges that began before Omicron was identified, though COVID-19 cases and deaths in many others have decreased or plateaued, Kasai said. But that could change.\", \"Among the places that have found the variant in the region are Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia\\u2014and it is likely to crop up in more places.\", \"The emergence of omicron is of particular concern for organizers of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, now about two months away.\", \"Beijing is adopting a series of measures to reduce the risk the virus will spread during the Games, Zhao Weidong, spokesperson for the organizing committee, told reporters at a briefing on Friday.\", \"China has adopted a zero-tolerance policy toward COVID-19 transmission and has some of the world's strictest border controls. Games participants will have to live and compete inside a bubble, and only spectators who are residents of China and have been vaccinated and tested will be permitted at venues.\", \"\\\"It is clear that this pandemic is far from over and I know that people are worried about Omicron,\\\" Kasai said. \\\"But my message today is that we can adapt the way we manage this virus to better cope with the future surges and reduce their health, social and economic impacts.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945312/omicron-airport-amsterdam.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Above, a worker at a coronavirus testing facility waits for passengers to arrive from South Africa at Amsterdam Schiphol airport on December 2, 2021, in the Netherlands.
