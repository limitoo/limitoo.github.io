We are now moving to suggesting to them that we create that freedom of movement for Wellingtonians and businesses by getting you to move your vehicles to a staged area police we will facilitate for you.\\\"\", \"It is not clear where exactly the police want protesters to move their vehicles to.\", \"Police have tried to engage with organisers, he said.\", \"\\\"We've never sat on our laurels and been waiting here. You know, we've been working 24/7 around the clock in terms of looking to engage.\\\"\", \"Covid-19 spreading through the crowd is a major concern for the police, Parnell said.\", \"\\\"Common logic would tell you in the presence of the audience we've got there, primarily no masks, a lot of non vaccination mandate. That that is a very real risk, not only to the occupiers but indeed to my staff.\\\"\", \"Sanitation issues at the site are also a concern for police, Parnell said.\", \"\\\"Sanitisation has been in the form of portaloos down there ... some of the filming has being quite graphic, particularly around children, and on the grounds the squalor of the water, defecation and surrounding environments.\\\"\", \"When asked if officials were too slow in responding to the convoy and allowing the protesters to erect tents at the site, Parnell said \\\"hindsight is a wonderful thing.\\\"\", \"\\\"We were fully aware of a convoy.
