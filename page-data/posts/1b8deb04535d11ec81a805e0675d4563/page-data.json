\"The girl was returned to her family within an hour, but Mabb fled the scene, prompting an extensive police search using drones, the rescue helicopter\\u00a0and Parks and Wildlife rangers on foot.\", \"Mabb also pleaded guilty to assaulting one of the Parks and Wildlife rangers who found him during the search.\\u00a0\", \"The Supreme Court in Launceston\\u00a0heard the girl and a four-year-old boy from another family were riding their bikes from the campsite towards a boat ramp.\", \"And that Mabb had parked his vehicle in bushland near the campground before he grabbed the girl by her legs and threw her into his car as she screamed.\", \"In sentencing submissions, Justice Robert Pearce told the court the child said \\\"she had been choked\\\" and that there was bleeding into the whites of both eyes, along with redness and bruising on her neck.\\u00a0\", \"Justice Pearce said choking carries a high risk of death or brain injury.\\u00a0\", \"<img

campsite, the court heard.\", \"Doctors found she had injuries consistent with strangulation, as well as blunt force trauma to her head and scratches and grazes to much of her body, the court heard.\", \"Justice Pearce said there was no evidence the child had been sexually assaulted but said it cannot be excluded as a potential motivating factor.\\u00a0\", \"He told the Supreme Court in Launceston that the effects on the girl may be \\\"lifelong\\\" and she \\\"continues to suffer from nightmares.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">History of child sex abuse</div>\", \"Justice

Mabb committed several sexual offences against children and was later imprisoned for these acts.\\u00a0\", \"The court heard that on his release, Mabb commenced a new life with his wife and started a family.\", \"Justice Pearce said when this relationship broke down in 2019, Mabb \\\"began to heavily abuse alcohol and prescription drugs\\\" and became \\\"estranged from his children.\\\"\\u00a0\",
