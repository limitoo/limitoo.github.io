Her name has been changed to protect her identity.\", \"Like many others, she joined what started as peaceful protests against fuel price rises in early January. Kazakhstan has some of the world's largest oil reserves but most of the population doesn't share in the wealth.\", \"The demonstrations quickly spiralled into mass disturbances and looting that led to the worst bloodshed in the former Soviet state's 30 years of independence.\", \"The authorities are accused of using excessive force to restore order. Officially, 225 people were killed and many more were injured. Some 10,000 people have been detained in the wake of the disturbances, the authorities say.\", \"Like many others, Asel, who is 57, is now worried that she could be arrested and accused of participating in the unrest.\", \"Kazakhstan's prosecutor-general's office has opened nearly 700 criminal cases. Some of those accused are charged with terrorism, murder and seeking to overthrow the government.\", \"However, human rights groups say the authorities are cracking down on everyone who took part in the protests, including peaceful demonstrators.\", \"Even those who simply posted on Facebook in support of the protests are being detained. They face beatings and torture, activists say.\", \"\\\"There is no presumption of innocence,\\\" said Bakhytzhan Toregozhina, a human rights activist in Almaty. \\\"They are all potential terrorists for the authorities and they try to force confessions out of them.\\\"\", \"One activist Muratbek Yesengazy who took part in the protest on Almaty's main square is accused of participating in the violence.

Initially, the mood of the crowd was festive when people rallied on 4 January. They sang the anthem of Kazakhstan and chanted political demands.\", \"\\\"The crowd was very diverse,\\\" recalls Timur Nusimbekov, a local journalist who watched events unfold in Almaty. \\\"There were people from the suburbs, people from the city centre. There were hipsters and young working people.\\\"\", \"The atmosphere started to change when the authorities threw stun grenades and fired tear gas to disperse the crowd, leading to clashes between police and protesters.\", \"The next day, on 5 January, tensions grew. Some people on the square in Almaty were armed with knives and hunting rifles, says Nusimbekov.\", \"It's still not clear who these people were.\", \"Azirbek of the Almaty police said \\\"well trained men versed in combat tactics\\\" attacked police with the aim of seizing their weapons.\", \"Protesters who were there blame unidentified provocateurs. \\\"We protested peacefully,\\\" one activist, Konay Abdiyev, told the BBC.\", \"\\\"But then a group of young men arrived and ran straight towards the city hall. We couldn't stop them. They destroyed cars and smashed windows.\", \"\\\"They were wearing masks that hid their faces. We were afraid even to look into their eyes out of fear that they would assault us.\\\"\", \"Events soon spiralled out of control. Some in the crowd seized the city hall and set it on fire. The sounds of gunfire and stun grenades rocked the square.\", \"One of those hit by the bullets was Asel.\", \"\\\"I could feel blood gushing from my leg. I had a blackout and then regained consciousness when two men were dragging me, covering me with their shields. They shouted to lay low as bullets whizzed by.\\\"\", \"She was put into a truck and driven to hospital. \\\"I remember there were a lot of people inside the truck. I moaned from pain.

They lined up and waved with their hands [to show they were unarmed].\\\"\", \"At around 7pm, the military opened fire.\", \"\\\"It sounded as if they were firing into the air but people behind us were dropping dead.

Two young girls of about 17 or 18, and another young man, were lying on top of each other.
