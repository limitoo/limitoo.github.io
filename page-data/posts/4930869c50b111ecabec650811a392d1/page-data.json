Inside the pub, the Tan Hill Inn, the beers were cold, the fires were warming and the musicians were electric.\", \"But outside, the winds were howling and the snow was swirling. The pub-goers knew the forecast was dire, but not so much that piles of snow as high as three feet would block the pub\\u2019s exits, said Nicola Townsend, the inn\\u2019s general manager.\", \"After the tribute band, Noasis, finished its set, the local authorities said it was not safe to drive home, Ms. Townsend said on Sunday night.\", \"So the patrons, the band members and seven inn employees stayed the night.\", \"And then another.\", \"And on Sunday night, they were preparing to stay another.\", \"Though the roads were not safe to travel, a group of off-roaders took a couple of parents home to their young children, Ms. Townsend said. A local mountain rescue group also helped evacuate a man who needed medical treatment for an \\u201congoing condition.\\u201d\", \"That has left 61 people, mostly strangers, stranded at the pub. To pass the time, they took pub quizzes, watched movies like \\u201cGrease\\u201d and \\u201cMamma Mia!\\u201d and sang karaoke, Ms. Townsend said.\", \"\\u201cLots of Oasis at the moment,\\u201d she said, adding that the pub-goers have started calling the tribute band \\u201cSnowasis.\\u201d\", \"Band members had to cancel a performance on Saturday night because they were snowed in. \\u201cWe have no way of making it to our gig,\\u201d the band said on Facebook.\", \"Those at the pub have enjoyed a few beers but no one is \\u201cgetting loud and drunk,\\u201d Ms. Townsend said, because they want to be \\u201crespectful of each other.\\u201d\", \"Some of those who were stranded already had rooms at the inn, while others had parked their motor homes outside. The rest crammed into the lounge, where they slept on sofas or on the floor. Employees supplied them with mattresses, blankets and pillows and kept the fireplaces roaring.\", \"They hope they can leave on Monday afternoon, but the problem, Ms. Townsend said, is that a downed power line has blocked the road leading out of the remote pub. The pub is in Richmond, a town in North Yorkshire, which is more than 200 miles northwest of London.\", \"Outside the pub, the United Kingdom has been reeling from the storm, which has been blamed for the deaths of at least three people who died in separate episodes on Friday.\", \"A man died in Cumbria, England, after a tree hit him, the police there said, while the other two \\u2014 a man in Northern Ireland and a man in Aberdeenshire, Scotland \\u2014 were struck by falling trees in their cars, the authorities said.\", \"The storm has paralyzed swaths of Britain\\u2019s power grid and left thousands without power. The Met Office, Britain\\u2019s national weather service, has issued several warnings since Friday about high winds and snow from the storm, which it has named Storm Arwen.\", \"The weather has shown no signs of letting up for the pub patrons. A video on social media showed snow blanketing the doorway and the cars parked outside, though emergency workers looked to be clearing a path out of the pub.\", \"The episode has drawn attention from around the world, and the inn has kept people updated on Facebook. In a post on Sunday night, it jokingly called the pub-goers \\u201cinmates\\u201d and said that \\u201csome are at breaking point.\\u201d\", \"But Ms. Townsend said that, for the most part, \\u201ceverybody seems to be really quite happy.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe best way I can describe it is it\\u2019s like being at a party with all your friends,\\u201d she said, adding that the inn would not run out of food because it stocks up for the winter.\", \"Those gathered have shared roast dinners, a couple of beers and even a buffet (on the house) with \\u201clots of different picky bits,\\u201d she said. Patrons have helped wash dishes and taken up a collection for the staff.\", \"\\u201cWe will ALWAYS remember this group of amazing people who came together, and hopefully, in challenging circumstances, enjoyed what we all think was a life-changing experience,\\u201d another Facebook post said.\", \"This is not the first time people have been snowed in at the inn. Ms. Townsend said this also happened on New Year\\u2019s Day in 2010. Waitrose & Partners, a U.K. grocery chain, filmed a commercial at the inn in 2017 featuring snowbound pub-goers enjoying a meal together.\", \"The group stuck in the pub may have started on Friday as strangers, but they will leave as friends, Ms. Townsend said, adding, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve even talked about having a reunion next year.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4930869c50b111ecabec650811a392d1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4930869c50b111ecabec650811a392d1"}},
