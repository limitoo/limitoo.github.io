The Associated Press received an email from the company with the update.\", \"\\\"We have worked with the Division of Gaming Enforcement to investigate the cause of the event and in turn have taken corrective action,\\\" wrote Julia Boguslawski, chief marketing officer at AGS.\", \"The bug is at the center of a lawsuit filed by Lisa Piluso of Yardley, Pennsylvania, who says she is entitled to the $100,000 jackpot the game said she won. AGS instead offered $280 before upping the offer to $1,000. In addition, 13 other players allegedly filed complaints against the company citing similar incidents. Piluso is accusing AGS of consumer fraud.\", \"The email by Boguslawski addressed the lawsuit. \\\"Although Ms. Piluso may disagree with the outcome of that administrative process,\\\" she continued, \\\"there is no precedent for her demand, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in court, if necessary.\\\"\", \"AGS was fined $1,000 by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.
