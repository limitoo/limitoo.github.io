On the account, she documented her life in Brisbane, where she studied fine art, and her travels to Shanghai, where she built an augmented reality company called Metaverse Makeovers.\", \"She had fewer than 1,000 followers when Facebook, the parent company of Instagram, announced on Oct. 28 that it was changing its name. Henceforth, Facebook would be known as Meta, a reflection of its focus on the metaverse, a virtual world it sees as the future of the internet.\", \"In the days before, as word leaked out, Ms. Baumann began receiving messages from strangers offering to buy her Instagram handle. \\u201cYou are now a millionaire,\\u201d one person wrote on her account. Another warned: \\u201cfb isn\\u2019t gonna buy it, they\\u2019re gonna take it.\\u201d\", \"On Nov. 2, exactly that happened.\", \"Early that morning, when she tried to log in to Instagram, she found that the account had been disabled. A message on the screen read: \\u201cYour account has been blocked for pretending to be someone else.\\u201d\", \"Whom, she wondered, was she now supposedly impersonating after nine years? She tried to verify her identity with Instagram, but weeks passed with no response, she said. She talked to an intellectual property lawyer but could afford only a review of Instagram\\u2019s terms of service.\", \"\\u201cThis account is a decade of my life and work. I didn\\u2019t want my contribution to the metaverse to be wiped from the internet,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThat happens to women in tech, to women of color in tech, all the time,\\u201d added Ms. Baumann, who has Vietnamese heritage.\", \"She started Metaverse Makeovers in 2012. When a phone running her app was held above one of the intricate real-world fingernail designs created by her team, the image on the screen would show holograms \\u201cpopping\\u201d from the nails. This was before Pok\\u00e9mon Go, before Snapchat and Instagram filters became part of everyday life.\", \"She saw the potential to scale the technology to clothing, accessories and beyond, but her investment money ran out in 2017, and she returned to the art world.\", \"In the meantime, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\\u2019s chief executive, was investing heavily in his own futuristic vision of the metaverse \\u2014 what he called \\u201can embodied internet where you\\u2019re in the experience, not just looking at it.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe metaverse,\\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in announcing his company\\u2019s new name, \\u201cwill not be created by one company.\\u201d Instead, he said, it will welcome a range of creators and developers making \\u201cinteroperable\\u201d offerings.\", \"Cory Doctorow, a tech blogger and activist, said this professed openness came with big caveats.\", \"\\u201cHe built Facebook by creating a platform where other businesses meet their customers,\\u201d Mr. Doctorow said, \\u201cbut where Facebook structures the overall market, reserving to itself the right to destroy those businesses through carelessness, malice or incompetence.\\u201d\", \"That vast power, governed by opaque policies and algorithms, extends to the company\\u2019s control over individual user accounts.\", \"\\u201cFacebook has essentially unfettered discretion to appropriate people\\u2019s Instagram user names,\\u201d said Rebecca Giblin, director of the Intellectual Property Research Institute of Australia at the University of Melbourne. \\u201cThere can be good reasons for that \\u2014 for example, if they\\u2019re offensive or impersonating someone in a way that causes confusion.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBut the @metaverse example highlights the breadth of this power,\\u201d she said, adding that under Facebook\\u2019s policies, users \\u201cessentially have no rights.\\u201d\", \"On Dec. 2, a month after Ms. Baumann first appealed to Instagram to restore her account, The New York Times contacted Meta to ask why it had been shut down. An Instagram spokesman said that the account had been \\u201cincorrectly removed for impersonation\\u201d and would be restored. \\u201cWe\\u2019re sorry this error occurred,\\u201d he wrote.\", \"Two days later, the account was back online.\", \"The spokesman did not explain why it had been flagged for impersonation, or who it might have been impersonating. The company did not respond to further questions about whether the blocking had been linked to Facebook\\u2019s rebranding.\", \"Now that her account has been resurrected, Ms. Baumann plans to fold the saga into an art project she started last year, P\\u221est_Lyfe, which is about death in the metaverse. She\\u2019s also considering what she can do to help ensure that the metaverse becomes the inclusive place she said she had tried to help build.\", \"\\u201cBecause I have been working in the metaverse space for so long, 10 years, I just feel worried,\\u201d she said. She fears, she added, that its culture could be \\u201ccorrupted by the kind of Silicon Valley tech bros who I feel lack vision and integrity.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3ebc87b25bd611ec88ea59f0411b2589"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3ebc87b25bd611ec88ea59f0411b2589"}},
