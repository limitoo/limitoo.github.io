Ms AF said the father was hard working, but the mother was a disciplinarian. The extended family were worse.\", \"There was little effort made to vet them, she said.\", \"\\\"There was no process. They got the letter from the priest, they got other letters from leaders in that community, and they were white.\", \"\\\"So they were the perfect family, according to our state.\\\"\", \"It was a similar story for Ms AE, who also appeared anonymously before the commission.\", \"She too was adopted out as a child, to a couple who gave little care.\", \"\\\"Basically, I was adopted to work on their farm. I don't believe I was ever considered a child. I can remember trying so very hard to please and meet approval, but that never worked,\\\" she said.\", \"The Royal Commission is holding a special hearing into M\\u0101ori experiences in state- and faith-based care.\", \"So far this week, it's heard of violence at state-run institutions and by foster parents employed by the state.\", \"But today's witnesses were adoptees, and were never checked on by officials.\", \"They were both physically and sexually abused. They said they were both neglected and made to feel worthless.\", \"Ms AE and Ms AF say their abuse occurred because the Adoption Act sought to assimilate.\", \"Wh\\u0101nau were never considered, they said. Instead, they were placed into homes that treated them with cruelty.\", \"She recalled telling her adoptive mother her M\\u0101ori name that was gifted to her by a kuia, and she responded by asking why she would want to be known by it.\", \"\\\"They're nothing but dirty savages, they're dirty people. She couldn't understand why I would want to be M\\u0101ori. I'm white enough, why would I want to be that way?\\\"\", \"Eventually, both managed to leave their adoptive parents' houses. But they endured years of trauma from the abuse, which had set them back in life.\", \"Ms AE said the lack of identity is a pain that runs deep.\", \"\\\"Being M\\u0101ori that's the first thing you get asked. Where are you from? Not being able to answer those questions wholly, I suppose, has always been a particular mamae [pain].\\\"\", \"But she has gone on to big things, has gained academic success and has her own wh\\u0101nau. Through great effort, she managed to track down details of her birth family and her whakapapa.\", \"Ms AF, too, has always sought to prove the world wrong.\", \"Reading through her adoption notes, she discovered an official had written her off as a baby. The notes read \\\"imbecile\\\" and \\\"idiot.\\\"\", \"She's got a PhD now. She asked to sing a waiata to the Royal Commission.\", \"And Bette Middler's The Rose rang out through the wharenui at \\u014cr\\u0101kei marae.\"]","href_hash":"b78672349fc411ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b78672349fc411ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
