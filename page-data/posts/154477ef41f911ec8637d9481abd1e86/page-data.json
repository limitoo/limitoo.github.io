I was the more pressure fighter, I was making the fight happening. All he wanted to do was hold, that whole Kronk style, holding and resting on you.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"That's what they do, which is good for them, but all I\\u2019m saying is if I have to pay somebody, if I have to pay one of the judges or anything, please let me know what account I have to send the money to.\\\"\", \"The 37-year-old, who confessed he's yet to watch the fight back, then turned his attention to Matchroom Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn at the top of the table to address his requirements directly.\", \"\\\"I'm going to say this honest, publicly to the press, that I need you Eddie [Hearn] to get a good referee, an American referee - not a British Board of Control referee because those guys in the past have stuffed me and they've messed me around. If [BBBOC general secretary] Robert Smith is listening, I do not want your referee to ref for me for this fight.\", \"\\\"And I need (Hearn) to get good refs and good judges for this fight, because I know for a fact that come [19th] of December, we're going to have a war.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Joseph Parker doesn't scare me, he hasn't got anything which I am scared of. He hasn't got power punches - I don't even know how they gave him the last fight to be honest with you. I'm just disappointed that they gave it to him.\\\"\", \"In response, Parker - preparing for the first rematch of his 31-fight profesisonal career - dismissed Chisora's complaints regarding their first contest and remains adamant his declaration as victor was justified.\", \"\\\"I did watch the fight back and I thought I won, so I'm not sure, he thought he won too so that\\u2019s why we're here again,\\\" said Parker.\", \"\\\"We didn't have the longest camp last time but we\\u2019ve had a longer camp this time so there are no excuses.\\\"\", \"Parker has been based in the English boxing stronghold of Morecambe since April, where he's been working alongside new trainer Andy Lee.\", \"The 29-year-old is eager to show off the improvements he's made and justify the sacrifice he's made in being separated from his young family, insisting he knows exactly what to expect against a fired-up Chisora.\", \"\\\"Derek is one tough guy. He comes forward and puts on the pressure. Like he said, bite the gumshield and throw the kitchen sink, that\\u2019s exactly what he did and what he's going to do for the next fight.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I feel like this fight is going to be different. I've had a lot more time to work on things that Andy has suggested I work on and now that I'm here with him in camp my confidence is growing every day seeing the improvements.\", \"\\\"We have to make these sacrifices as fighters, I know a lot of fighters that make sacrifices, I'm away from my wife and family, my parents. I feel like it's my time to make it count.\\\"\", \"Also featuring on the card will be fellow Kiwi David Nyika, who'll fight his first professional bout since his bronze medal win at the Tokyo Olympics in July.\\u00a0He'll take on undefeated Mancunian Jordan Thompson, who boasts nine knockouts in his 11 career wins to date.\", \"Nyika has been training alongside Parker in Morecambe and says he's primed to make a statement on the big stage, after making significant strides under Lee.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I'm in the heart of professional boxing here so this is a massive opportunity for me,\\\" Nyika states. \\\"I'm looking to put myself on notice in the cruiserweight division.\", \"\\\"I think there\\u2019s a lot more to professional boxing than I initially though. I feel like I\\u2019m rebuilding Rome starting to work with Andy Lee.\", \"\\\"I'm in great company with the likes of Joseph Parker, the Fury\\u2019s are in camp, I'm a sponge right now and this is a great opportunity for me to grow, learn and develop as a boxer and also, as a person.\\\"\", \"Join Newshub on December 19 for live updates of Parker v Chisora II\"]","href_hash":"154477ef41f911ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"154477ef41f911ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
