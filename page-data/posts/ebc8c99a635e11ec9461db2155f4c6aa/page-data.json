Shina Vang and his fellow soldiers in the Minnesota National Guard have had an exceptionally busy year. They helped process Afghan refugees fleeing Kabul for the United States, provided security at American military bases across the Horn of Africa and stood sentinel in Washington, D.C., following the Jan. 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol.\", \"Closer to home, they have been deployed across Minnesota during the civil unrest prompted by the police killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Daunte Wright in nearby Brooklyn Center.\", \"But none of those experiences prepared Private Vang and his fellow Guard members for their latest deployment: collecting bedpans, clipping toenails and feeding residents at North Ridge Health and Rehab, a sprawling nursing home in suburban Minneapolis that is the largest in the state.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve had protesters throw apples and water bottles at me but that doesn\\u2019t compare to the challenge of giving someone a bed bath,\\u201d Private Vang said.\", \"Over the past two weeks, 30 Guard members have been working as certified nursing assistants at North Ridge, which has been so badly hobbled by an exodus of employees that administrators have been forced to mothball entire wings, severely limiting new admissions.\", \"As a result, hospitals cannot send patients to long-term care centers like North Ridge, creating a backup that is eroding Minnesota's capacity to treat people with Covid-19 and other medical emergencies. Similar backlogs \\u2014 hospital patients well enough to be discharged but too fragile to go home \\u2014 are choking health systems across the country.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s beyond a crisis,\\u201d said Katie Smith Sloan, the president of LeadingAge, an association of nonprofit long-term care facilities. \\u201cFor many providers across the country, it\\u2019s a collapse.\\u201d\", \"On Tuesday, President Biden announced that 1,000 military medical professionals would be dispatched to hospitals across the country this winter to help overwhelmed doctors and nurses.\", \"Public health experts fear the worst is yet to come as the highly transmissible Omicron variant spreads to communities where health care workers are already straining to handle the surge of patients sickened by Delta. Maine, New Hampshire, Indiana and New York have deployed the National Guard to overburdened hospitals and nursing homes in recent weeks, but Minnesota\\u2019s initiative may be the most ambitious, with 400 guard members who have no previous nursing experience going through rapid-fire training before being sent to long-term care facilities across the state.\", \"Last week, chief executives from nine of the state\\u2019s largest hospital networks took out advertisements in Minnesota newspapers beseeching residents to get vaccinated and to take other steps to limit transmission of the coronavirus. \\u201cWe\\u2019re overwhelmed,\\u201d the ads said.\", \"Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat and National Guard veteran whose mother was a nursing assistant, said he conceived of the program as a stopgap measure.\", \"\\u201cOur health care work force is heartbroken and fatigued,\\u201d Governor Walz said in an interview on Tuesday, not long after learning that he and his wife and son had tested positive for the coronavirus. \\u201cHaving the Guard provide a bit of a respite is a godsend but just to be clear, looking to the horizon we don\\u2019t see an end to the surge right now.\\u201d\", \"Staffing shortages have long been a problem for nursing homes in the United States, but the coronavirus has pushed many to the brink as low-wage aides retire early or quit for jobs that are better paid and less taxing. \\u201cThe pandemic has underscored the system\\u2019s fragility, and the need for fundamental change,\\u201d said R. Tamara Konetzka, an expert in the economics of long-term care at the University of Chicago.\", \"In Minnesota, that means 23,000 nursing home positions were unfilled in October, up from 8,000 last March, according to a survey of providers.\", \"North Ridge has been hit especially hard by the pandemic, with more than 592 cases and 52 Covid deaths among its residents since March 2020, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, though the vast majority of those cases, 472, were among patients already sickened by Covid when they arrived. Over the past four years, North Ridge has been fined more than $180,000 by federal inspectors, and cited for a number of health and safety violations. It has received two out of five stars for overall care from C.M.S., a \\u201cbelow average\\u201d rating.\", \"Austin Blilie, the vice president of operations, said the two-star rating was based on surveys from 2018, and that North Ridge had greatly improved the quality of care since then. He noted that the most recent rating from earlier this year gave the facility five stars for staffing quality. The 8.5 percent mortality rate for Covid patients at North Ridge, he added, was less than half the state average for patients in congregate care settings.\", \"\\u201cEvery time I look at the numbers of those who we lost, I am struck anew by the fact that every one represents an individual person, with a life and a history, and connections to other people,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPlease know that we never lose sight of that here.\\u201d\", \"A low-slung collection of brown and tan brick buildings, North Ridge has 320 beds, but 100 of those are empty at the moment because of staff shortages. The employees that remain have been running ragged as they work overtime, and on some days, administrators, dietitians and physical therapists are forced to help with making beds and filling water pitchers. \\u201cWe do what we can because the show must go on,\\u201d said Liz Ellenz, 37, the director of dining, who often works weekends and stays until 9 p.m. washing dishes. \\u201cSome days are really dark.\\u201d\", \"But on Thursday, Ms. Ellenz was positively giddy as five Guard members zipped around the kitchen with soldierly purpose and precision. They hosed down food carts, bagged trash and helped prepare the day\\u2019s lunch: ham and macaroni au gratin, stir-fried snow peas and citrus gelatin cubes.\", \"One of them, Staff Sgt. Nathan Madden, 47, whose civilian job is an assistant manager at a home improvement store, said the past two weeks had given him a newfound appreciation for those who care for the sick and the elderly. His past deployments have taken him to Kuwait, Croatia and, more recently, the Minneapolis courthouse where Derek Chauvin was on trial for the murder of Mr. Floyd. \\u201cThis kind of work is humbling for sure,\\u201d Sergeant Madden said, adjusting the hairnet on his head. \\u201cIt\\u2019s great to help out in the community, but I have older parents, so in a way this is preparing me for what I might have to do one day.\\u201d\", \"Certified nursing assistants, the workhorses of long-term care facilities, normally go through five weeks of training before taking final exams, but nursing school leaders condensed the program to eight 10-hour days. \\u201cIt feels like we\\u2019re supporting a natural disaster,\\u201d said Traci Krause, the director of nursing at Minneapolis Community & Technical College, as a group of students practiced pulse taking and face washing on bed-bound mannequins.\", \"Besides gestures like providing free pizza and ice cream, there isn\\u2019t much North Ridge\\u2019s administrators can do to stem the exodus of staff members; the number of employees at the nursing home has dropped to 450 from 590 since the start of the pandemic. Although burnout and fears of infection have spurred some nursing assistants to quit, the root of the problem is money, employees and administrator say.\", \"North Ridge and other long-term care facilities in Minnesota that serve mostly patients on Medicaid pay around $16 an hour for newly hired nursing assistants. That\\u2019s comparable to what some fast-food outlets in and around New Hope have been offering. (Kitchen staff at North Ridge are paid even less: $11.25 an hour.)\", \"Such low wages are essentially tied to the state\\u2019s reimbursement rate for nursing home patients, which averages about $270 a day, according to the Minnesota Department of Human Services. Efforts by Governor Walz to raise reimbursement rates have stalled in the state\\u2019s politically divided legislature, as has his push to use some of the $1.2 billion in unspent Recovery Act funds on bonuses and raises for nursing aides.\", \"Fatimate Massquoi, a nursing manager at North Ridge, said meager pay coupled with the physical demands of the job, the anxieties of treating Covid patients and the unending loss, inevitably takes a toll. \\u201cPeople don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to hold the hand of someone dying alone because their family isn\\u2019t allowed to be here,\\u201d she said. \\u201cSometimes after a patient dies, I have to go into the bathroom to cry so no one will see me because I have to stay tough.\\u201d\", \"With Omicron racing across the country, staff and administrators worry about the weeks ahead. Only 60 percent of residents have received their booster shots, slightly higher than the national average, and a federal appeals court ruling last week means that North Ridge may have to fire the 10 percent of employees who remain unvaccinated.\", \"But last Thursday, Ms. Massquoi and her colleagues were feeling buoyant after learning that the National Guard would be staying an extra week, including 18 soldiers who had volunteered to work over the Christmas holiday. Having extra hands available does not mean North Ridge can increase its number of admissions, but it does allow exhausted workers to take a few days off.\", \"\\u201cThe Guard has really given us the opportunity to take a breather, and allow people to spend time with their families and try to deal with the emotional burnout of the last 18 months,\\u201d said Mr. Blilie, the vice president of operations. \\u201cHopefully, they\\u2019ll come back feeling a bit refreshed, and ready to go back at it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ebc8c99a635e11ec9461db2155f4c6aa"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ebc8c99a635e11ec9461db2155f4c6aa"}},
