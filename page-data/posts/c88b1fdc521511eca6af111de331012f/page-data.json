She ultimately pleaded guilty in June to helping Mr. Guzm\\u00e1n smuggle drugs across the U.S. border and make his dramatic flight from a high-security Mexican prison, an operation that involved a self-powered rail cart, a watch outfitted with a GPS device and a mile-long tunnel dug into the shower of his cell.\", \"A dual U.S.-Mexican citizen, Ms. Coronel has, like her husband, long been a figure of public fascination, a role that she has often stoked by her lavish lifestyle and her laissez-faire attitude toward paparazzi. At her sentencing hearing in Federal District Court in Washington, she expressed \\u201ctrue regrets\\u201d for her crimes and begged Judge Rudolph Contreras to ignore the fact that she was the wife of an infamous drug lord.\", \"\\u201cPerhaps because of this, there is reason for you to be harder on me,\\u201d Ms. Coronel said. \\u201cBut I pray that you do not do that.\\u201d\", \"While it is unusual for law enforcement to go after the spouses of drug-world figures, prosecutors at Mr. Guzm\\u00e1n\\u2019s trial offered substantial evidence that Ms. Coronel, while still in her 20s, was deeply enmeshed in her husband\\u2019s criminal business.\", \"They introduced BlackBerry messages, for instance, that made clear that she had helped Mr. Guzm\\u00e1n conduct his illicit operations, sometimes alongside her own father, In\\u00e9s Coronel Barreras, who was one of her husband\\u2019s top lieutenants and was taken into custody in 2013 in Mexico.\", \"Other messages indicated that Ms. Coronel was intimately involved not only in Mr. Guzm\\u00e1n\\u2019s famous 2015 tunnel escape from Altiplano prison in Toluca, Mexico, but also in helping him to evade capture by American and Mexican authorities after a botched raid in 2012 in the Mexican resort town Cabo San Lucas.\", \"At Mr. Guzm\\u00e1n\\u2019s trial, his onetime chief of staff, D\\u00e1maso L\\u00f3pez N\\u00fa\\u00f1ez, told the jury that Ms. Coronel had sought to help her husband escape from prison yet again after he was recaptured in 2016 and returned to Altiplano. According to Mr. L\\u00f3pez, Ms. Coronel hatched a plot to bribe Mexico\\u2019s top prison official, but Mr. Guzm\\u00e1n was extradited to the United States to stand trial before the plan could be carried out.\", \"As part of her plea deal with the government, Ms. Coronel agreed to turn over about $1.5 million in illicit proceeds from her husband\\u2019s illegal operations. While she admitted to helping him move at least 450 kilograms of cocaine, 90 kilograms of heroin and nearly 90,000 kilograms of marijuana into the United States over the years, she still received a relatively light sentence in part because her role in smuggling even that amount of drugs made her a \\u201cminimal participant\\u201d in a much larger criminal enterprise, according to her plea deal.\", \"\\u201cThe defendant was not an organizer, leader, boss or other type of manager,\\u201d Anthony J. Nardozzi, a federal prosecutor, told the court. \\u201cRather she was a cog in a very large wheel of a criminal organization.\\u201d\", \"In the wake of Ms. Coronel\\u2019s arrest, there was widespread speculation that she \\u2014 like so many of Mr. Guzm\\u00e1n\\u2019s former allies \\u2014 had decided to cooperate with U.S. authorities against other members of the organization he once led, the Sinaloa drug cartel. But in court papers filed this month, prosecutors said she had helped the government only in the prosecution of her own case.\", \"Ms. Coronel\\u2019s lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, called the allegations that she had cooperated with the government \\u201cgarbage,\\u201d adding that they had put his client\\u2019s life in danger. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if she can ever go back to her home in Mexico,\\u201d Mr. Lichtman said.\", \"The Sinaloa cartel remains one of Mexico\\u2019s most powerful criminal mafias, even in Mr. Guzm\\u00e1n\\u2019s absence. It is said to be run by an uneasy alliance of his sons, one of his brothers and his longtime partner, Ismael Zambada Garc\\u00eda, all of whom have been indicted in the United States.\"]","href_hash":"c88b1fdc521511eca6af111de331012f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c88b1fdc521511eca6af111de331012f"}},
