NRL players who refuse to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before the 2022 season.\", \"The NRL has decided against following the AFL's lead by mandating vaccination, leaving it up to individual\\u00a0choice.\", \"But Smith, 38, who retired in March after a record 433 games with the Storm over 19 seasons as hooker and occasional half-back, said state coronavirus laws would\\u00a0make it almost impossible for unvaccinated players to take part.\", \"The NRL confirmed last week that players who were not vaccinated against COVID-19 would not be able to play or train in Victoria or Queensland as state borders opened up.\", \"For now, unvaccinated players will be able to train and play in NSW, but with strict protocols.\", \"\\\"It really doesn't matter the position the NRL has taken,\\\" Smith told the ABC at the City of Logan Sports Awards, south of Brisbane.\", \"\\\"So\\u00a0there are consequences for [unvaccinated] athletes in the NRL
