We know local authorities are conducting a full investigation, and we're here to support them however we can. Our thoughts and prayers go to Mr. Luna, his family, friends, and the medical team providing him care.\\\"\", \" The Rams beat the 49ers 20-17 before a crowd of 70,000 to advance to the Super Bowl.\", \" Luna owns a Peruvian fusion restaurant called Mistura in Oakland.
