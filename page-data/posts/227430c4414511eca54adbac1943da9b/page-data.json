Those who are not eligible for the shots will be exempt from the rule, it said, including children under 12 and people with certain medical conditions.\", \"The announcement came as the number of severe cases, which have been mainly among unvaccinated people, has stabilized but remains high, the ministry said. Of about 280 intensive-care beds for Covid patients, 134 are occupied, and most are among those not vaccinated, a senior minister of state, Janil Puthucheary, said at a news conference.\", \"\\u201cWe have to continue to try to keep this number as small as possible,\\u201d he said, since health care workers \\u201ccontinue to be stretched.\\u201d\", \"Singapore has vaccinated more than 80 percent of its population, outpacing most other countries. But the sustained numbers of severe cases have put such a strain on Singapore\\u2019s health care system that officials said they would expand the overall hospital capacity to 4,000 hospital beds from 2,500 by the end of the month.\", \"Most Covid patients vulnerable to severe illness and requiring intensive care are people ages 60 and over, Mr. Puthucheary said. At least 6 percent of people 60 and over in Singapore have yet to get shots, according to the Health Ministry.\", \"\\u201cWe have to send this important signal to urge everyone to get vaccinated if you are eligible,\\u201d the health minister, Ong Ye Kung, said at the news conference.\", \"Patients who are unvaccinated by choice may still use other health care financing options to pay their bills, such as government subsidies and private insurance, it added. Even for those who are unvaccinated, billing \\u201cwill still be highly supported and highly subsidized,\\u201d Mr. Ong said.\", \"Singapore will continue to cover partly vaccinated patients until Dec. 31 to allow them time to get their second shots, the health ministry said.\", \"To encourage vaccinations, the officials said they would also begin allowing five fully vaccinated people from any household to dine in restaurants together starting on Wednesday, up from the two that are currently allowed.\"]","href_hash":"227430c4414511eca54adbac1943da9b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"227430c4414511eca54adbac1943da9b"}},
