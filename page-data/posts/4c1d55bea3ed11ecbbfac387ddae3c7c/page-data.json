We woke up when we heard the sound of the first explosion. We went to the bunker,\\\" he said. \\\"It looked scary.\\\"\", \"His 25-year-old cousin was training at the facility, Mr Vitalii said, and his family were still trying to contact him.\", \"Another resident, Nadin Berezovska, said she could see the fire from her parents' flat, where she had been living after fleeing the country's capital, Kyiv. \\\"It was very scary. We're in shock,\\\" Ms Berezovska, a 39-year-old photographer, said.\", \"\\\"Now we realise that it doesn't matter where you live,\\\" she said. \\\"We aren't safe. How can Poland be safe?\\\"\", \"The base has previously been used for military training of Ukrainian troops, often with instructors from the US and other Nato countries. It was not immediately clear whether foreign instructors were at the centre when it was hit.\", \"The attack is significant because the base, one of Ukraine's largest military facilities, is located just 25km from Poland, a Nato member. The border with Poland is a vital route for refugees, but also for weapons being sent by countries in the military alliance - which have included anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/139887/eight_col_000_324Z778.jpg?1647109115\\\" alt=\\\"Ukrainian police officers help residents to cross a destroyed bridge as they evacuate Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, on 12 March 2022. \\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nUkrainian police officers help residents to cross a destroyed bridge as they evacuate Irpin, north-west of Kyiv, on 12 March. \\nPhoto: AFP\\n</div>\", \"It is also the first major attack in western Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion of the country, on 24 February. The region has become a hub for millions of people escaping the war in other areas of the country. Around 2.6 million have left Ukraine so far.\", \"\\\"We're very scared,\\\" Yurii Vitiv, a 50-year-old driver, said. \\\"Until this morning we had hoped that the war would stop on eastern Ukraine.\\\"\", \"Hours earlier, Sergei Ryabkov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, said Moscow had warned the US that \\\"pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn't just a dangerous move, it's an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets\\\".\", \"Despite sending weapons, Nato has, so far, ruled out a request by Ukraine's government to establish a no-fly zone over the country, saying this would trigger a wider conflict with Russia.\", \"But Andriy Sadovyy, the mayor of Lviv, said such a measure was necessary to prevent Russia from carrying our aerial strikes.\", \"\\\"Europeans, understand this situation: it's easy to talk and drink coffee and say they're deeply concerned... but every hour the skies are not closed, the Russians are killing civilians and children,\\\" he told the BBC in an interview.\", \"\\\"We need closed sky.
