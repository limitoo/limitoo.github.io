The first crash, which caused the Chevrolet Equinox to flip, reportedly occurred around 2:30 a.m., police said\", \"According to police, the driver of the Equinox was pulling out of a parking lot when she reportedly collided with a Nissan Maxima, causing the Equinox to flip onto its right side and land in the far left lane.\", \"\\\"Alcohol and speed are believed to be factors in the initial collision, according to investigators,\\\" the Durham Police Department said. \\\"Alcohol is not believed to be a factor in the fatal collision. Both crashes remain under investigation.\\\"\", \"According to the American Automobile Association (AAA), accidents that occur on the shoulders of roads are not uncommon, especially among people who work or respond to accidents in those zones. Last month, AAA issued a release about the danger of assisting on the shoulders of roads in the wake of the deaths of two AAA tow truck drivers in separate accidents.\", \"\\\"The recent deaths of two AAA tow providers, killed while assisting motorists, highlight just how dangerous it is for individuals who regularly work along the shoulders of America's busy and congested roads,\\\" said the AAA release.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928476/police-car-lights.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Police are investigating a car accident in which a woman was struck and killed on the shoulder of a road after she tried to help trapped motorists in North Carolina.

In an effort to reduce the number of these collisions, AAA has worked to pass Move Over laws throughout the country.\", \"North Carolina's Move Over law took effect in January 2002 to protect state troopers and other law enforcement officers and emergency and utility workers, per the North Carolina Department of Public Safety.\", \"The law states that motorists must slow down when nearing an emergency vehicle that is stopped on the shoulder of the roadway with its lights flashing. If a driver is found in violation of the law, they may be fined $250, plus court costs.\"]","href_hash":"4cd46ab340d911ec888609cf38cb383a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4cd46ab340d911ec888609cf38cb383a"}},
