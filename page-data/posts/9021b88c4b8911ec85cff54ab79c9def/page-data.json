Tonga and Samoa are set to vaccinate their adult populations before the end of the year, according to the modeling, which is subject to change.\", \"However, the Solomon Islands are not expected to fully vaccinate their adult population until April 2026, while it is estimated to take Vanuatu until then to vaccinate 86 percent of its adult population. And Papua New Guinea, the slowest in the region, will have vaccinated only about 16 percent of its population by December 2022.\", \"These countries have been hampered by overstretched health care systems and rampant vaccine misinformation, Mr. Dayant said.\", \"Facebook is often people\\u2019s primary source of information there, and unsubstantiated theories of Western plots to inoculate people with microchips and black magic circulate on social media, he said, adding: \\u201cmisinformation spreads much quicker than the virus in the Pacific.\\u201d\", \"He said wealthy countries could do more, like bolstering local health care systems. \\u201cIt is in the interest of the world to vaccinate developing countries,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"9021b88c4b8911ec85cff54ab79c9def"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9021b88c4b8911ec85cff54ab79c9def"}},
