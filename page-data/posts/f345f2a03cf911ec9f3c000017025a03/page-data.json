In Virginia, where Republicans made schools central to their pitch, education rocketed to the top of voter concerns in the final weeks of the race, narrowly edging out the economy.\", \"The message worked on two frequencies. Pushing a mantra of greater parental control, Glenn Youngkin, the Republican candidate in Virginia, stoked the resentment and fear of some white voters, who were alarmed by efforts to teach a more critical history of racism in America. He attacked critical race theory, a graduate school framework that has become a loose shorthand for a contentious debate on how to address race. And he released an ad that was a throwback to the days of banning books, highlighting objections by a white mother and her high-school-age son to \\u201cBeloved,\\u201d the canonical novel about slavery by the Black Nobel laureate Toni Morrison.\", \"But at the same time, Mr. Youngkin and other Republicans tapped into broader dissatisfaction among moderate voters about teachers\\u2019 unions, unresponsive school boards, quarantine policies and the instruction parents saw firsthand during months of remote learning. In his stump speeches, Mr. Youngkin promised to never again close Virginia schools.\", \"While Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic nominee, and his party allies eagerly condemned the ugliest attacks by their opponents, they seemed unprepared to counter the wider outpouring of anger over schools.\", \"For weeks before the Virginia election, Republicans pointed to the school strategy as a possible template for the entire party. Mr. Youngkin\\u2019s narrow but decisive victory on Tuesday confirmed for Republicans that they had an issue capable of uniting diverse groups of voters. The trend was most evident in Mr. Youngkin\\u2019s improvement over former President Donald J. Trump\\u2019s performance in the Washington suburbs, which include a mix of communities with large Asian, Hispanic and Black populations.\", \"Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, listed education as a main plank of his party\\u2019s plan to reclaim power, with promises to introduce a \\u201cParents\\u2019 Bill of Rights.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIf the Virginia results showed us anything, it is that parents are demanding more control and accountability in the classroom,\\u201d he wrote in an election-night letter to his caucus.\", \"Steven Law, the president of American Crossroads, one of the most active outside groups working to elect Republicans to the House and Senate, said the strategy was ripe for replicating in races across the country.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s always possible to overdo something,\\u201d he added, cautioning that Republicans would be unwise to pursue attacks that appear hostile to teachers themselves. \\u201cBut very clearly there\\u2019s a high level of concern among parents over political and social experimentation in schools that transcends ideology.\\u201d\", \"While the conservative news media and Republican candidates stirred the stew of anxieties and racial resentments that animate the party\\u2019s base \\u2014 thundering about equity initiatives, books with sexual content and transgender students on sports teams \\u2014 they largely avoided offering specific plans to tackle thornier issues like budget cuts and deepening educational inequalities.\", \"But the election results suggested that Republicans had spoken about education in ways that resonated with a broader cross-section of voters.\", \"In Virginia, the Youngkin campaign appealed to Asian parents worried about progressive efforts to make admissions processes in gifted programs less restrictive; Black parents upset over the opposition of teachers\\u2019 unions to charter schools; and suburban mothers of all races who were generally on edge about having to juggle so much at home over the last year and a half.\", \"\\u201cThis isn\\u2019t partisan,\\u201d said Jeff Roe, the Youngkin campaign\\u2019s chief strategist. \\u201cIt\\u2019s everyone.\\u201d\", \"Democrats largely declined to engage deeply with such charged concerns, instead focusing on plans to pump billions into education funding, expand pre-K programs and raise teacher pay.\", \"In Virginia and New Jersey, the Democratic candidates for governor adopted the approach of Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who faced a recall challenge that exploited similar lines of attack but beat it back by leaning into vaccination and mask mandates in schools. \", \"Ahead of the midterms, many of the educational issues are sure to linger.\", \"Already, the effects of remote learning on parents have been severe: School closures drove millions of parents out of the work force, led to an increase in mental health problems among children and worsened existing educational inequalities. Many of those effects were borne most heavily by key parts of the Democratic base, including women and Black and Latino families.\", \"Strategists, activists and officials urged Democrats to prepare for the Republican attacks to be echoed by G.O.P. candidates up and down the ticket.\", \"Geoff Garin, a top Democratic pollster, said the party\\u2019s candidates needed to expand their message beyond their long-running policy goals like reducing class sizes and expanding pre-K education.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be incumbent on Democrats to have a compelling response,\\u201d said Mr. Garin, who worked as a pollster for Mr. McAuliffe during his 2013 campaign for governor. \\u201cThey also need to be prepared to assert the value of public education in terms of a place where there\\u2019s a common curriculum and common set of values that most voters agree are the right ones for public schools.\\u201d\", \"Katie Paris, a party activist who runs a group that works to mobilize suburban women, said that even as she warned that attacks over critical race theory had been \\u201cspreading like wildfire,\\u201d her pleas for resources had gone largely unanswered by party donors and officials.\", \"\\u201cThese outside forces have come for our schools and our communities, and at the highest levels within the Democratic Party, people have just said, \\u2018Well, don\\u2019t talk about it,\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cThe unwillingness to engage in this was a big mistake, and it will be in 2022, too.\\u201d\", \"Rashad Robinson, the president of the racial justice organization Color of Change, expressed a similar concern, saying that Democrats\\u2019 reluctance to defend the need for public schools to teach honestly about race had left the party at a disadvantage.\", \"Democrats, he said, \\u201cdon\\u2019t show up when the conversation gets tough.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cCritical race theory isn\\u2019t being taught, but we need to actually tell people what is being taught and why this is a strategy to prevent our kids from learning about all of our history,\\u201d said Mr. Robinson, who has advised Democratic strategists and candidates about their messaging on the issue. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about banning Black history, but it\\u2019s also about banning American history.\\u201d\", \"The issue, some party strategists admitted, is particularly complicated for Democrats who rely on teachers\\u2019 unions for financial and volunteer support. National and state union leaders drew public ire for slowing the reopening of schools even after teachers were given early access to vaccines. In the final days of the Virginia campaign, Mr. McAuliffe appeared with Randi Weingarten, the influential president of the American Federation of Teachers, which drew rebukes from Republicans.\", \"After the election, Ms. Weingarten blamed Mr. McAuliffe\\u2019s defeat on his comment that he did not believe \\u201cparents should be telling schools what they should teach.\\u201d But she also chided Democrats for their timidity, warning that tough conversations were needed to rebuild trust between parents and their schools.\", \"There are signs of limitations to the Republican approach. Though the party poured outside money and advertising into school board races \\u2014 typically sleepy local affairs \\u2014 the early results were mixed, with conservative candidates losing in Wisconsin, Connecticut and Minnesota. \", \"Yet nationally, the issue seems particularly resonant in affluent suburban communities that faced some of the longest periods of remote schooling. While schools are universally open this year, education in Virginia and nationwide has continued to be disrupted by occasional quarantines and classroom closures to contain the coronavirus.\", \"Last year, Virginia was among the East Coast states that were slowest to reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning. While some parents supported the cautious approach \\u2014 driven by teachers\\u2019 unions, school boards and some administrators \\u2014 others became frustrated and angry, especially in suburban counties like Fairfax and Arlington.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s a level of anxiety and anger and people wanting to have their lives back,\\u201d said Ms. Weingarten, who faced blowback for hosting a town hall event in September with Open Schools USA, a group that opposes masks and vaccine mandates in schools. \\u201cBut we have to engage. That, I think, is the big lesson.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f345f2a03cf911ec9f3c000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f345f2a03cf911ec9f3c000017025a03"}},
