The manatees will be fed by humans, although the officials reiterated that it is still illegal for civilians to feed wild animals in Florida.\", \"Water pollution from farms and sewage in the state breeds harmful organisms like blue-green algae, which kills or stifles the growth of underwater seagrass, the main source of food for the manatees.\", \"Over 1,000 manatees have died in the state this year which is a record for the state, and officials said about 7,000-8,000 manatees are left in the oceans around the state.\", \"The program is a temporary measure as the state spends millions to improve the water quality in other common seagrass growth areas like the Indian River Lagoon, a refuge for manatees in the winter.\", \"Last month, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced $481 million for grants to improve water quality, with about $53 million being used in the Indian River Lagoon region, according to the Associated Press.\", \"The plan is a drastic step taken by what Executive Director of the Save the Manatee Club Patrick Rose told the AP last week is necessary because the record number of deaths constitutes an emergency that requires unprecedented action.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952771/florida-manatees-starving-feeding-program.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">On Wednesday, state wildlife officials say a test feeding plan will save many threatened manatees from starvation as winter approaches Florida, but they say the manatees will still face the threat of manmade water pollution stifling their food supply.
