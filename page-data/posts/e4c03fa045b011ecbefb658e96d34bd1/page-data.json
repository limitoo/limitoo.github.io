The result, a quarterly drop of 0.8 percent, followed a slight expansion in the previous three-month period, when economic output grew at a revised annualized rate of 1.5 percent, or a quarterly rate of 0.4 percent.\", \"But brighter days may be ahead, at least in the near term.\", \"Japan now has one of the highest vaccination rates among major nations, and it has lifted virtually all restrictions on its economy as its virus caseload has fallen in recent weeks to one of the lowest levels in the world.\", \"Seventy-five percent of the country is fully vaccinated. And coronavirus case counts have hovered in the low hundreds since mid-October, a decline of about 99 percent since their August peak, heralding the return of long-suppressed consumer spending.\", \"Bolstering the positive outlook, policymakers, fresh off an election, are preparing a new round of stimulus that would provide support to ailing businesses and put cash in the hands of people nationwide.\", \"The payments are likely to be more effective than previous ones, which went straight into people\\u2019s savings accounts, said Wakaba Kobayashi, an economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research in Tokyo.\", \"\\u201cThis time, people are less constrained; it\\u2019s become OK to go out,\\u201d she said, adding that \\u201cunder these conditions, it\\u2019s easier to promote consumer spending.\\u201d\", \"Even before the pandemic, Japan, with its aging population and waning business competitiveness, was struggling to achieve economic growth. After a growth spurt in the second half of last year, the economy has been stuck in a cycle of expansion and contraction, ebbing and flowing with the virus\\u2019s waves.\", \"While other major economies have returned to life on the back of loosened restrictions, Japan has seemed unable to extricate itself from the virus-induced quagmire, the consequences of months spent struggling with the pandemic.\", \"The country started the July-to-September period on the back foot because of a clunky vaccine rollout that left it far behind its peer countries.\", \"By midsummer, it was in the midst of its toughest battle yet with the virus. The Delta variant caused cases to surge just as Tokyo prepared to kick off the Summer Olympics. Sponsors rolled back advertising campaigns, and tourists stayed home. The Games, which were conducted without spectators, failed to deliver the economic boost that had been promised when the country was chosen as host.\", \"As the virus spread, Japan entered a new state of emergency. Restaurants and bars closed early and travel dried up, with many people deciding to stay home rather than brave record-high case counts.\", \"At the same time, semiconductor shortages battered the country\\u2019s automakers, forcing many to drastically cut production. In September, the top eight Japanese manufacturers made about half as many cars as they had at the same time in the previous year.\", \"\\u201cThere was an enormous drop in production, and even if people wanted to buy cars, they couldn\\u2019t,\\u201d Ms. Kobayashi said.\", \"Since the country ended its state of emergency last month, however, foot traffic has nearly returned to prepandemic levels, said Tomohiko Kozawa, a researcher at the Japan Research Institute.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s a risk that infections could begin to spread again, but for the moment, the outlook points to recovery,\\u201d he said, adding that \\u201cwe can expect high growth\\u201d in domestic consumption in the coming months.\", \"The auto industry, too, is expected to rebound, he said, as chip manufacturers expand production and the pandemic ebbs in Southeast Asia, where the virus shut down factories that manufacture critical parts for Japanese vehicles.\", \"\\u201cExports should recover in the first three months of next year,\\u201d Mr. Kozawa said.\", \"Hoping to get the economy back on track, the government is expected to pass its economic stimulus package in the coming days, which would provide cash handouts to families with children under 18, give aid to small businesses and put in place measures to offset rising fuel prices, which have increased costs across a range of industries.\", \"Still, other factors will continue to weigh on growth. The country remains closed to tourists \\u2014 and difficult to enter for many businesspeople and students \\u2014 and it is unclear when the borders might reopen. Before the pandemic, many businesses in Japan had relied on a steady stream of visitors from abroad.\", \"Although the country should be congratulated for its success in tackling the virus, it needs to articulate a vision for what comes next, said Daisuke Karakama, chief market economist at Mizuho Bank.\", \"Even as daily reported infections in Tokyo have dropped to low double digits, \\u201cthere\\u2019s no road map\\u201d he said, and \\u201cno strategy.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e4c03fa045b011ecbefb658e96d34bd1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e4c03fa045b011ecbefb658e96d34bd1"}},
