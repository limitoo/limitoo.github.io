The report details how, according to its data, the richest 52 percent of the world population now takes in 52 percent of the world's income. By contrast, the poorest half of the entire world makes up only 8 percent.\", \"Additionally, the report found even starker contrasts in wealth ownership. In 2021, the richest 10 percent own a considerable 76 percent of the world's wealth. Meanwhile, the poorest half own a paltry 2 percent.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946812/wealth-inequality-2021.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">According to the latest World Inequality Report, the richest 52 percent of the world population now takes in 52 percent of the world's income.

In general, it found that the region known as \\\"MENA,\\\" constituting the Middle East and Noth Africa, has the worst inequality, while Europe has the least disparity. For comparison, the wealthiest 10 percent in the MENA region make 58 percent of the income, compared to 36 percent in Europe.\", \"The national average income for a country is a poor indicator of a country's overall economic inequality, according to the report. The report noted that the U.S., with its generally high income, boasted significant inequality. Meanwhile, medium-to-low income nations like Malaysia and Uruguay were found to have relatively moderate levels of inequality.\", \"\\\"Income and wealth inequalities have been on the rise nearly everywhere since the 1980s, following a series of deregulation and liberalization programs which took different forms in different countries,\\\" the report continued. \\\"The rise has not been uniform: certain countries have experienced spectacular increases in inequality [including the US, Russia and India] while others [European countries and China] have experienced relatively smaller rises. These differences, which we discussed at length in the previous edition of the World Inequality Report, confirm that inequality is not inevitable, it is a political choice.\\\"\", \"In November, Mexican President Andr\\u00e9s Manuel L\\u00f3pez Obrador touched on the issue of global wealth inequality, calling on the rich to take action toward helping the poor. Speaking before the U.N. Security Council, he proposed a plan that would take only 4 percent of the income from the world's 1,000 wealthiest people and 0.2 percent of the GDPs from 20 major economies to help generate funds for the world's very poorest communities.\", \"\\\"The spirit of cooperation is losing ground to the desire for profit, and this is leading us to slide from civilization into barbarity,\\\" L\\u00f3pez Obrador said. \\\"We are moving forward, alienated, forgetting moral principles, and turning our backs on the pain of humanity.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"a4243b56577b11ec9e4921f6dab68d9f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a4243b56577b11ec9e4921f6dab68d9f"}},
