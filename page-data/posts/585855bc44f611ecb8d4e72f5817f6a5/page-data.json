soon\\u00a0be eased for those fully vaccinated.\", \"The state was initially expected to hit the milestone \\u2014 70 per cent of Queenslanders aged 16 years or older double dosed \\u2014\\u00a0on November 19.\", \"Based on the most recent figures, 81.99\\u00a0per cent of Queenslanders aged 16 years or older have received one dose\\u00a0of a COVID-19 vaccine and 70.25 per cent are now fully vaccinated.\", \"It means\\u00a0arriving in\\u00a0Queensland, including from a hotspot, is about to\\u00a0become a lot easier for people who are fully vaccinated, coming\\u00a0by air and have had a negative COVID test.\", \"When the state reaches 80 per cent double-dose vaccinations, or December 17,\\u00a0restaurants and cafes, nightclubs and bars, cinemas, festivals and theme parks will no longer have density limits for fully vaccinated customers.\", \"Weddings will be unrestricted, as long as everyone attending is fully vaccinated.\", \"Double-vaccinated people will also be able to visit aged care facilities, disability services and hospitals\\u00a0and loved ones in prison.\", \"However, none of the\\u00a0freedoms will apply to people who are not fully vaccinated.\", \"Unveiling Queensland's roadmap last month, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said lifting restrictions\\u00a0was a reward for Queenslanders who had taken public health advice.\", \"\\\"That is good news for families to be reunited for Christmas,\\\" she said.\", \"However, Ms Palaszczuk asked people not to start making their way into Queensland just yet.\", \"\\\"I will let you know,\\\" she said on Thursday.\", \"Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said the Premier would provide more details about the state's changing border restrictions at Monday's press conference.\", \"<img

enter\\u00a0the state must have had two doses of a COVID-19\\u00a0vaccine, with their second shot\\u00a0being administered at least two weeks before entering the state.\", \"If they are\\u00a0coming\\u00a0from an interstate hotspot, or have been to one in the previous 14 days, several factors will determine whether they\\u00a0can enter and if they have to hotel quarantine.\", \"If you have been to a COVID hotspot in Australia 14 days prior to arrival, you must arrive by air.\\u00a0\", \"Along with being fully vaccinated, you must\\u00a0have proof of a negative TGA-approved COVID test within the previous 72 hours.\", \"You must then undergo quarantine at home for 14 days before going\\u00a0out into\\u00a0the Queensland community.\", \"If you do not meet these criteria,

you have not been to a hotspot in the 14 days before\\u00a0your arrival, you can enter Queensland without restrictions and without having to undergo\\u00a0quarantine.\", \"You will\\u00a0need to provide a negative TGA-approved COVID\\u00a0test taken within the previous 72 hours and complete any necessary documentation.\\u00a0\", \"Ms D'Ath said interstate travellers from hotspots\\u00a0would be able to apply for a border pass as soon as Queensland hit\\u00a0the 70 per cent\\u00a0target.\", \"\\\"If you can meet all that criteria, the border pass will be automatic so you won't have to wait one, two, three days to get that approval,\\\" Ms D'Ath said.\", \"\\\"So when we hit that 70 per cent mark \\u2026 people can start booking their flights, going off and getting their [COVID-19] test
