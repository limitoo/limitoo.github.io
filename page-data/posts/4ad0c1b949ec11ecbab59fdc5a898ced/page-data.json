Here’s how to respond.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-20T10:26:59.000Z","content":"[\"There are a few things that I know will likely happen during holiday family gatherings. My 7-year-old son will show an embarrassingly small amount of gratitude for any gift that isn\\u2019t a toy; my 3-year-old son will hurt himself jumping off furniture; and someone from my extended family will ask me when the boys\\u2019 father and my partner of eight years plans on proposing. This will force me to say the same thing I say every year: not anytime soon.\", \"We\\u2019re hardly alone in such thinking. Studies have shown that many young couples prefer to cohabitate rather than marry; and about a quarter of parents living with a child are unwed. Societal views on marriage have also shifted, with the vast majority of Americans now believing it\\u2019s acceptable for a couple to live together sans wedding plans.\", \"Of course, not everyone has accepted nontraditional relationship paths, especially in more conservative circles.\", \"\\u201cWhen a couple chooses not to marry and the family decides that they have a role in that decision, that can create a lot of family gossip and what looks like an alliance \\u2014 one side versus another,\\u201d said Katherine Hertlein, a relationship therapist and professor in the couple and family therapy program at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, School of Medicine. This can sow division between a couple, she said.\", \"If you\\u2019re planning on attending a holiday event this season, and are expecting to have friends, family members, or even nosy co-workers pester you about setting a wedding date, here\\u2019s how you can respond in a healthy, respectful way.\", \"Dr. Hertlein believes that people asking about a possible wedding may be looking more to validate their own personal values. Couples, she said, need to communicate their shared principles and decide in advance what they wish to divulge with others.\", \"It\\u2019s best that the person related to the inquiring family member be the one to take the lead, while the other person plays a supportive role. This will help to minimize any reasons, real or perceived, for a family member to blame a partner.\", \"\\u201cThese conversations can involve a great deal of tension,\\u201d Dr. Hertlein said, \\u201cand the last thing I want is for someone who is not related to the family directly to bear the brunt of any negativity and the sole responsibility of the decision making.\\u201d\", \"Melanie Cote, 43, a child care provider living in Vancouver, Canada, met her partner, Jamie, 45, when she was 35. The two have a 4-year-old daughter together, but have no plans to marry. It is a decision her family doesn\\u2019t entirely support, especially her mother. Before attending family functions, the couple create what Ms. Cote refers to as a \\u201cgame plan\\u201d to handle the marriage question.\", \"\\u201cWe just make sure we know what we\\u2019re going to say: that we\\u2019re committed, we have a kid, and we\\u2019ve been together for eight years,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe always do this respectfully, and we don\\u2019t challenge people\\u2019s thought process or their values or even how they grew up.\\u201d\", \"[Sign up for Love Letter and always get the latest in Modern Love, weddings, and relationships in the news by email.]\", \"Some family members may attempt to divide and conquer, cornering one individual when they are alone. Dr. Hertlein suggests you hold off on any discussion until your partner returns.\", \"\\u201cYou can say, \\u2018We\\u2019ve had some really good talks about marriage. If this is a conversation you want to have with us, let me just go get my partner,\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cMake sure that you reflect that boundary you have as a couple.\\u201d\", \"Maria Afentakis, 41, an author living in London, has been with her boyfriend, Timothy, 43, an accountant also living in London, for five years. She said her aunt usually waits until her boyfriend of five years leaves before she pesters her with the marriage question, despite Ms. Afentakis consistently telling her family the pair have no plans to get married.\", \"\\u201cIf my partner is gone somewhere, she\\u2019ll corner me and ask what\\u2019s going on with us,\\u201d she said. When this happens. Ms. Afentakis will often stall the conversation until her partner returns. \\u201cThankfully, he\\u2019s supportive and has great communication skills, so he knows how to navigate the discussion and move onto a different question.\\u201d\", \"If you are considering marriage sometime down the road, discussing any future dates with prodding family members should mostly be avoided. \\u201c\\u200b\\u200bThe \\u2018right time\\u2019 is more of an abstract concept, and it\\u2019s more difficult for families to understand,\\u201d Dr. Hertlein said. \\u201cThe family will focus on ways they can help you accelerate the timeline, making it more difficult for the couple to resist their meddling.\\u201d\", \"So instead of assuaging marriage-minded family members with a possible timeline, simply share that marriage is an ongoing discussion in your relationship. Irina Firstein, a therapist practicing in Manhattan, said couples can tell people that they\\u2019re figuring it out on their own, and would appreciate it if no one asked them questions because it just \\u201cputs the pressure on us\\u201d and doesn\\u2019t help them reach an understanding any faster.\", \"\\u201cYou can also add that you appreciate their concern and understand their anxiety, but their questions are causing problems for you as a couple,\\u201d she said. \\u201cJust say that when you know a wedding date, they\\u2019ll be the first to know.\\u201d\", \"Eric Hutchison, 29, a life raft technician living in Seattle, said he had no intention of getting married until he met his now-fiance, Rebecca Anderson, 33, an event manager also living in Seattle. Six months into their relationship he began fielding questions from family members about his intentions \\u2014 questions he couldn\\u2019t answer.\", \"\\u201cI know it made my partner uncomfortable because she didn\\u2019t have a great answer either, or knew when and if I would propose to her,\\u201d Mr. Hutchison said. \\u201cThe more that question was asked the more pressured she felt and I could see it. We had talked about marriage a few times early in our relationship and I knew it meant a lot to her.\\u201d\", \"The couple eventually started telling inquiring family members that they simply didn\\u2019t \\u201chave a date yet.\\u201d Mr. Hutchison said the question did force the two to discuss the possibility of marriage. When the time did come, the decision to propose was his and his alone. \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t willing to jump into marriage before I wanted to, just to make those people happy,\\u201d Mr. Hutchison added. \\u201cIt took 4 years, but ultimately I ended up proposing because I love my partner and want to show her I am committed to her.\\u201d\", \"While not ideal, if a family member isn\\u2019t respecting a verbal boundary, you may need to set a physical one and avoid some family functions entirely. Dr. Firstein says that the decision to stay away from certain family members doesn\\u2019t have to be permanent, though it might be necessary to salvage a relationship.\", \"Ms. Afentakis said that her boyfriend recently declined to attend one of her family\\u2019s gatherings, because he \\u201ccouldn\\u2019t face\\u201d the marriage question again. That breather gave them both a chance to prepare for Afentakis\\u2019 next family affair \\u2014 her mom\\u2019s 60th birthday party, which took place two months later. She said that while they generally try to avoid the conversation entirely, a break allowed them some respite before being around family again.\", \"Usually, family members with marriage on the brain will let the question go \\u2014 either because you set a date or perhaps they were able to see how you value your relationship in other ways outside of marriage. In the meantime, know that these conversations can actually bring you and your partner closer together.\", \"\\u201cIf the two of you feel like you\\u2019re supporting each other, you\\u2019re articulating the same message, you\\u2019re staying strong as a couple, and you\\u2019re setting boundaries, you\\u2019re going to be better off and that\\u2019s going to be a bonding experience,\\u201d Dr. Hertlein said. \\u201cEmotionally intense periods can enhance relationships.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Cote said that her and her boyfriend \\u201cfeel more unified than ever.\\u201d And she added, \\u201cI set my intentions right from the beginning and he did too, so neither of us had ever veered from that path. We\\u2019ve always presented a united front and we know we\\u2019re on the same page.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4ad0c1b949ec11ecbab59fdc5a898ced"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4ad0c1b949ec11ecbab59fdc5a898ced"}},
