If you don't ship up (sic), we're gonna ship you out,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We're not standing here waiting for another three years when the next election rolls down, we'll roll this place and tip them out with a revolution of the people.\\\"\", \"Tennis balls emblazoned with threatening and abusive messages, many of them targeted at politicians, were also thrown by the crowd at reporters later in the day.\", \"Photos of the balls posted to social media by journalists from Newstalk ZB and Stuff show them labelling MPs \\\"paedophiles\\\" and carrying death threats aimed at the Prime Minister.\", \"Newshub has also seen death threats toward Jacinda Ardern posted on private anti-vaxx chatrooms.

We can see straight through you.\\\"\", \"Responding to the tetchy atmosphere and threats, Ardern told reporters on Tuesday she didn't believe the protesters to be representative of the majority of New Zealanders.\", \"Asked if she'd seen an increase in threats against her, she said \\\"I haven't necessarily\\\".\", \"\\\"But nor necessarily would I see all of that. Yes, I do run my own social media so of course I get a slice of that, but I'm very clear that's not indicative of the vast bulk of New Zealanders.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"fbcecb6f41f811ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fbcecb6f41f811ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
