They never lost control of a single chamber, even as Democrats won some of the states\\u2019 races for president, governor and Senate.\", \"All three of those Northern states are likely to see some shift back toward parity this year, with a new independent commission drawing Michigan\\u2019s maps, and Democratic governors in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania will probably force the process to be completed by the courts.\", \"Gerrymandering is a tool used by both parties in swing states as well as less competitive ones. Democrats in deep-blue states like Illinois are moving to increase their advantage in legislatures, and Republicans in deep-red states like Utah and Idaho are doing the same.\", \"But in politically contested states where Republicans hold full control, legislators are carefully crafting a G.O.P. future. They are armed with sharper technology, weakened federal voting statutes and the knowledge that legal challenges to their maps may not be resolved in time for the next elections.\", \"In Texas, North Carolina and Ohio, Republican governors have signed into law new maps with a significant advantage for the party. Georgia is moving quickly to join them.\", \"Republicans say that the growth of such heavily skewed legislatures is both the result of the party\\u2019s electoral victories and of where voters choose to live.\", \"State legislative districts are by nature much smaller in population than congressional districts, meaning they are often more geographically compact.\", \"As Democratic voters have crowded into cities and commuter suburbs, and voters in rural and exurban areas have grown increasingly Republican, G.O.P. mapmakers say that they risk running afoul of other redistricting criteria if they split up those densely populated Democratic areas across multiple state legislative districts.\", \"\\u201cWhat you see is reflective of the more even distribution of Republican and right-leaning voters across wider geographic areas,\\u201d said Adam Kincaid, the director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust. Trying to draw more competitive legislative districts, he said, would result in \\u201cjust a lot of squiggly lines.\\u201d\", \"He pointed to maps in Wisconsin that were proposed by a commission created by Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat. Under those designs, Republicans would still have a majority in both state legislative chambers (though with significantly smaller margins).\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re limited by geography,\\u201d Mr. Kincaid said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s only so many things you can do to spread that many voters across a wide area.\\u201d\", \"Democrats note that Republicans are still cracking apart liberal communities \\u2014 especially in suburbs near Akron and Cleveland in Ohio and in predominantly Black counties in northern and central North Carolina \\u2014 in a way that helps the G.O.P. and cuts against a geographical argument.\", \"\\u201cThey are carving up Democratic voters where they can\\u2019t pack them,\\u201d said Garrett Arwa, the director of campaigns at the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. He argued that Democratic map proposals \\u201call put forth better and more fair maps that I would say are far from a Rorschach test.\\u201d\", \"Democrats have fewer opportunities to unilaterally draw state legislative maps, particularly in battleground states. Of the 14 states where the margin of the 2020 presidential race was fewer than 10 percentage points, Democrats are able to draw state legislative maps in just one: Nevada. Republicans control the redistricting process in six of those 14 states. (The rest have divided governments, or their maps are drawn by commissions.)\", \"But when Democrats have had an opening, they have also enacted significant gerrymanders at the state legislative level. In Nevada, Democrats are close to finalizing a map that would give them supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature, despite President Biden\\u2019s winning just 51 percent of the state\\u2019s vote last year.\", \"The same holds true in deeply blue states. In Illinois, newly drawn State Senate maps would give Republicans roughly 23 percent of seats in the chamber, even though former President Donald J. Trump won more than 40 percent of voters in the state in 2020.\", \"Republicans have taken two approaches to ensure durable majorities in state legislatures. The tactics in Texas and Georgia are more subtle, while Republicans in Ohio and North Carolina have taken more brazen steps.\", \"In Texas and Georgia, the party has largely eliminated competitive districts and made both Republican and Democratic seats safer, a move that tends to ward off criticism from at least some incumbents in the minority party.\", \"\\u201cOut of the 150 seats in the Texas House, only six of them are within seven points or closer,\\u201d said Sam Wang, the director of the Princeton Redistricting Project. Republicans now hold a 20-seat advantage in the chamber, 85 to 65, and the new maps will give the party roughly two more seats. So while the G.O.P. lawmakers did not try to draw an aggressive supermajority, \\u201cwhat they really did a good job of there is getting rid of competition and getting a reasonably safe majority for themselves,\\u201d Mr. Wang said.\", \"Democrats in the Texas Legislature argue that the new maps are yet another reason that the party\\u2019s leaders in Washington must redouble their efforts to pass federal voting rights protections.\", \"\\u201cAs long as Democrats sit in this ma\\u00f1ana moment and do nothing on federal voting rights legislation, there\\u2019s nothing to stop Republicans from getting whatever they want,\\u201d said Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democratic state representative from San Antonio.\", \"Republicans in the Texas Legislature, however, say that the state\\u2019s maps are a fair representation of voters, and that if any districts are unfair, it is largely the result of incumbents on both sides protecting themselves.\", \"\\u201cIncumbents generally get to draw their own maps, so that\\u2019s how it\\u2019s done \\u2014 it\\u2019s each member being able to draw it for their re-election,\\u201d said Briscoe Cain, a Republican state representative from the Houston area. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a big state, we\\u2019ve got many regions and cultures. I believe the Texas House reflects those distinctions.\\u201d\", \"In Georgia, where redistricting is ongoing, early maps follow a trend line similar to that of Texas, as Republicans try to eliminate competitive districts. \", \"With the current gerrymandered maps in place, Democrats in the state legislature would have needed to win more than 55.7 percent of the vote to flip the Georgia House in 2020, according to the Princeton Gerrymandering Project.\", \"The new maps proposed in Georgia maintain that 55 percent threshold, according to Princeton.\", \"In Ohio and North Carolina, however, Republicans are taking a forceful tack. By keeping some districts moderately competitive, they are taking more risks in an attempt to create significant majorities or supermajorities \\u2014 and in doing so, they are often flouting laws or court decisions.\", \"In Ohio, after Republicans drew themselves supermajorities in both the State House and Senate in 2011, voters approved a ballot initiative creating a bipartisan commission to draw the maps and dictating that \\u201cno district plan should be drawn to favor or disfavor a political party.\\u201d\", \"But this year, Ohio Republicans ignored the commission, creating a House map that favors roughly 67 percent of G.O.P. seats and a Senate map that gives Republicans an advantage in roughly 69 percent of districts, preserving supermajorities. \", \"\\u201cThe suggestion we hear from Republicans in Ohio is that the Republicans hold the statewide offices so that means that, \\u2018Oh, we prefer Republicans,\\u2019\\u201d said Emilia Strong Sykes, the Democratic minority leader in the State House. \\u201cAnd sure, maybe that is the case. But it is not in a three-to-one fashion that they have concocted in their minds and in their maps.\\u201d\", \"In North Carolina, Republicans in the legislature were forced by courts to redraw their maps twice in the past decade for obvious partisan gerrymandering. But with the opportunity to draw fresh maps, Republicans reverted to their old strategies, proposing maps that would give the party a 64-to-56 edge in the State House and a 32-to-18 advantage in the State Senate if the statewide vote were split 50-50, according to PlanScore.org, a nonpartisan site.\", \"Both the Ohio and North Carolina legislative maps were met with immediate lawsuits, and North Carolina legislators were sued even before the maps were finalized. But the legal process for redistricting can take years, meaning that extremely gerrymandered maps can remain in place for multiple election cycles while challenges trudge along in the courts.\", \"Republicans are \\u201cwilling to be a bit more aggressive in a state like Ohio and in North Carolina,\\u201d said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice. \\u201cThey\\u2019re daring the courts to strike them down.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a5b91c8e4e0011ecb0e9ab886255e1c0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a5b91c8e4e0011ecb0e9ab886255e1c0"}},
