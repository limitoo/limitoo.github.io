The requirement is to kick in January 4. Failure to comply could result in penalties of nearly $14,000 per violation.\", \"Schmitt said Missouri has 3,443 private employers, with a combined 1.3 million employees, who could be covered by the vaccine requirement. He said he sued \\\"to protect personal freedoms, preserve Missouri businesses, and push back on bureaucratic tyrants who simply want power and control.\\\"\", \"The Biden administration\\u00a0has been encouraging widespread vaccinations\\u00a0as the quickest way out of the pandemic. A White House spokeswoman said Thursday that the emergency standard was intended to halt the spread of a disease that has claimed more than 750,000 lives in the U.S.\", \"Missouri was joined in the lawsuit by the\\u00a0Republican attorneys general\\u00a0of Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. The office of Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, a Democrat, also joined in the suit, along with several private, nonprofit and religious employers.\", \"The Daily Wire, a conservative media company, filed a challenge in federal court on Thursday. So did companies in Michigan and Ohio represented by a conservative advocacy law firm, as well as\\u00a0two Wisconsin manufacturers\\u00a0represented by a conservative law firm.\", \"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis Thursday also said that the new regulations are \\\"unconstitutional\\\" and that he plans to sue OSHA.\\u00a0\", \"Florida has\\u00a0banned counties\\u00a0from enforcing their employees to be vaccinated. It has also\\u00a0banned school districts\\u00a0from universally enforcing mask mandates among students, and officials have voted to withhold funds from districts that do not adhere to these rules.\", \"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton tweeted on Thursday that he will announce his plans to sue \\\"once this illegal, unconstitutional regulation hits the Federal Register.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"c479e61c3e5111ec913d5d713c26f64c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c479e61c3e5111ec913d5d713c26f64c"}},
