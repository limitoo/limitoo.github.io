The clip, posted by @dumpsterdivingfreegan, has generated 2.6 million views since it was shared late last week, amassing over 200,000 likes and thousands of outraged comments.\", \"This wasn't the first time that @dumpsterdivingfreegan visited the supermarket and reportedly came away with a massive haul: In October, she said in a video that she found \\\"nearly 100\\\" bread products, cases of olive oil, and much more in one night at a particular Whole Foods location.\", \"TikToker @dumpsterdivingfreegan makes videos about her freegan lifestyle, a central tenet of which is minimizing waste\\u2014often exemplified in the practice of dumpster diving.\", \"\\\"Perhaps the most publicized Freegan waste-reduction strategy, commonly called dumpster diving or urban foraging, involves foraging through the waste of retailers, residences, offices, and other facilities for useful goods,\\\" explained the resource site Freegan.info.\", \"\\\"These goods are safe, usable, clean, and often in perfect or near-perfect condition, a symptom of a throwaway culture that encourages disposability. Some urban foragers go at it alone, others dive in groups, but Freeganism emphasizes sharing discoveries with one another and with anyone along the way who wants them,\\\" they added.\", \"\\\"Every time I come to this particular store I find cases of organic food that is thrown out well before its best-by date,\\\" explained the TikToker in her video. \\\"Last night, I found enough meat to feed an entire community. I found everything from organic chicken and beef to Beyond Meat.\\\"\", \"\\\"It was 33 degrees Fahrenheit outside, so everything here was still super cold and had been recently tossed,\\\" she added. \\\"Everything had been thrown out on or before its best-by date, and as we know, best-by dates are not hard rules and everything was still good to consume.\\\"\", \"The video footage showed huge quantities of food, including a whole turkey, rows of packaged, raw meat, yogurt, guacamole, salads and fruit.\", \"\\\"I've never seen any discount stickers on any of the items a Whole Foods has thrown out,\\\" she added.\", \"The TikToker provided some additional context for the uninitiated in her comments section: \\\"To those who are not familiar with what I do: I have survived on scavenged food for nearly two years now. I take the [utmost] safety precautions when diving and do not feed anyone food without telling them where it comes from.\\\"\", \"Moreover, the spokesperson noted that, due to the TikToker's anonymity, the company hasn't been able to verify the video's accuracy. They also pointed out that food can be rendered unsafe and discarded for a number of reasons besides its best-by date, such as if a refrigerator case breaks down overnight.\", \"Though @dumpsterdivingfreegan's video remains unverified, its engagement from viewers highlights consumers' ever-growing interest in more sustainable practices from large companies and corporations.\", \"\\\"Food scarcity, like all aspects of poverty, is a policy choice,\\\" wrote @sadcat31.\", \"\\\"Let's start holding companies accountable and give to those in need,\\\" echoed @diyrenovator.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950853/whole-foods-produce.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Last week, a TikToker went viral for showing food waste allegedly scavenged from a Whole Foods dumpster.
