The man who crushed the trade deadline by bringing in four outfielders who would carry his team through the World Series was now crushed himself.\", \"Alex Anthopoulos, Atlanta\\u2019s president of baseball operations and general manager, architect of one of the greatest trade deadlines in memory, a man who not long ago left a five-year contract extension and millions on the table in Toronto as a matter of principle, now would have to stay home and miss Games 4 and 5 in Atlanta and, ultimately, Game 6 here Tuesday night as his team clinched its first championship since 1995.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m fully vaxxed, I don\\u2019t have any symptoms, I feel great,\\u201d Anthopoulos said by phone from his home in the Atlanta area around 2 a.m. Eastern time Wednesday as Atlanta\\u2019s celebration roared on without him at Minute Maid Park. \\u201cI was surprised. My family is fine.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cWe watched the game together at home like it was a New Year\\u2019s Eve party at my house counting down the outs at home. I\\u2019d love to be there.\\u201d\", \"Only Terry McGuirk, the club\\u2019s chairman, and Manager Brian Snitker knew about the positive test, Anthopoulos said, because \\u201cwhat I didn\\u2019t want was for it to become a story where the players and manager were getting asked about it. I wanted all the focus on the team.\\u201d\", \"The players didn\\u2019t even know until after they won the title, Anthopoulos said, because \\u201cone minute of time spent with me being the topic would have been inappropriate.\\u201d It turned out he wasn\\u2019t alone: Kevin Liles, a photographer for the team, revealed a positive test Wednesday as well.\", \"Everyone in and out of an Atlanta uniform playing for the team, working for the organization or simply lucky enough on this night to be somehow related to all this fun, agreed: Life and baseball both sometimes are not fair, but it is how you play the hops that counts.\", \"Anthopoulos played them beautifully. This was a team that didn\\u2019t quite take off until the season\\u2019s second half. The starting pitcher Mike Soroka (Achilles\\u2019 tendon) and outfielder Ronald Acu\\u00f1a Jr. (knee) were lost early in the season to devastating injuries. Another outfielder, Marcell Ozuna, did not play after June 1 after he was arrested on domestic violence charges.\", \"The story already has been told countless times and will be told by Atlanta baseball fans for generations to come. Rather than feel sorry for themselves and wave the white flag, Anthopoulos and his front office acquired four outfielders at the trade deadline: Joc Pederson from the Chicago Cubs, Eddie Rosario from Cleveland, Adam Duvall from Miami and Jorge Soler from Kansas City.\", \"Duvall and Soler combined to knock in 12 of Atlanta\\u2019s 25 runs in this World Series. Rosario, who was the most valuable player of the National League Championship Series, scored five of them. Soler was named the most valuable player of the World Series. Never before have two midseason acquisitions cornered both postseason M.V.P. awards for a team.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s here, he really is,\\u201d McGuirk said of Anthopoulos while celebrating on the field. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve lived dog years through this year. We were left for dead multiple times in the first half.\\u201d\", \"Back home in Georgia, Anthopoulos\\u2019s family was back in bed. Alex watched the game with his wife, Cristina, and, partly, with his daughter, Julia, 11, and son, John, 9. The kids went to bed at 8:30 p.m., but Alex woke Julia when Soler smashed a three-run homer in the third inning. Then he woke John in the ninth inning \\u201cso he could watch the end.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t trade Alex Anthopoulos for any executive in baseball,\\u201d McGuirk said. \\u201cI fell in love with him the first time I met him, and he\\u2019s more than rewarded the faith we had in him. I just FaceTimed him a few minutes ago and he\\u2019s as ecstatic as all of us.\\u201d\", \"Anthopoulos\\u2019s path to the World Series came after a near miss in 2015 and then a bombshell. A native of Montreal, he started in baseball with the Expos in 2000, moved to the Blue Jays in 2003 and ascended to vice president of baseball operations and general manager there in 2009. By 2015 he had built a 93-game winner that nearly pushed Kansas City, the eventual World Series champion, to a Game 7 in the A.L.C.S., leaving runners on second and third in the ninth inning of a 3-2 loss in Game 6. It was Toronto\\u2019s first playoff appearance in 22 years.\", \"Less than a week later, he was gone. The team had hired Mark Shapiro from Cleveland to replace Paul Beeston as president and, unlike Beeston, Shapiro\\u2019s style was to involve himself in baseball operations. Anthopoulos, the newly minted A.L. Executive of the Year, declined the five-year extension that he termed a \\u201cbeyond generous offer\\u201d and bet on himself.\", \"\\u201cTrust me, I was 38, I remember walking out of that meeting with that offer thinking, \\u2018OK, I think I\\u2019m going to stay,\\u2019\\u201d Anthopoulos said. \\u201cBut the more I thought about it, I just couldn\\u2019t get comfortable. I wanted to get comfortable, I really did. But I couldn\\u2019t. And it wouldn\\u2019t have been fair to the organization and to everyone there for me not to be all in. And if I was not all in, I wasn\\u2019t going to sign.\\u201d\", \"He and Cristina talked that night.\", \"\\u201cHer family was there, our kids were in school, we were settled and she said, \\u2018What do you think?\\u2019\\u201d Anthopoulos said. \\u201cI said, \\u2018I want to take it. It\\u2019s unbelievable for my family. But I don\\u2019t believe I\\u2019m going to be happy. But if you want me to sign it, I\\u2019ll sign it.\\u2019 She said: \\u2018If you\\u2019re not happy, you\\u2019re not going to be a good dad and you\\u2019re not going to be a good husband. You\\u2019re 38. Let\\u2019s not worry about the money.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"So they slept on it. Anthopoulos asked Cristina the next morning if she was sure she was OK with the decision. And with that he left the Blue Jays.\", \"Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers\\u2019 chief baseball executive, quickly added Anthopoulos to a powerhouse staff that included Farhan Zaidi, now San Francisco\\u2019s president of baseball operations. Two years later, when M.L.B. issued a lifetime ban to Atlanta\\u2019s general manager, John Coppolella, for violating international signing rules, the club brought Anthopoulos east.\", \"He inherited a team that included several key components of this year\\u2019s run, including Freddie Freeman, Dansby Swanson, Ozzie Albies and Acu\\u00f1a. He added several of his own touches, like naming Snitker as manager and this year\\u2019s trade deadline flourishes.\", \"\\u201cPersonally, it is impossible to be any happier for Alex, Cristina and their kids,\\u201d Friedman said in a text message shortly after Atlanta won Tuesday night. \\u201cHe is as committed, passionate and knowledgeable of an executive as I have been around. He and his staff have done an incredible job adjusting to all of the challenges they were confronted with this season.\\u201d\", \"John Schuerholz, the Hall of Fame executive who was Atlanta\\u2019s general manager from 1990-2007 and remains vice chairman emeritus, called Anthopoulos the \\u201cperfect fit.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s smart. He cares about people. He knows how to interact with people,\\u201d Schuerholz said. \\u201cHe plans ahead. He\\u2019s always got good plans and he activates them when it\\u2019s appropriate.\\u201d\", \"At home in the wee hours, Anthopoulos paused to take inventory. Toronto is in a \\u201cgreat position\\u201d right now, he said. He had two good years with Friedman and Zaidi out west and, now, this. He is the first Canadian-born general manager to win a World Series title, and while he said that everything happens for a reason, he acknowledged \\u201cthis isn\\u2019t the way I thought it would work out.\\u201d\", \"The first World Series game Anthopoulos attended was in Toronto, Game 5, 1992, when Atlanta\\u2019s Lonnie Smith hit a grand slam. His uncle was a Toronto season-ticket holder and his friend had seats. And Anthopoulos watched Atlanta regularly in Montreal because his family had TBS, the cable network that carried Braves games for more than 30 years.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s incredible,\\u201d Anthopoulos said. \\u201cYou never know where your path is going to bring you. As long as you make decisions in life for the right reasons, in the long run things should work out.\\u201d\", \"He paused, then added: \\u201cObviously, I would have loved to be there. \\u2018Elated\\u2019 is probably an understatement, but I view this as not a one-night thing. It is something you celebrate forever.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"dc82de383def11ecba5e000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dc82de383def11ecba5e000017025a03"}},
