The malware compromised everything from militaries to central government offices.\", \"Insikt told the Associated Press it believes the targeting is state-sponsored because it \\\"aligns with the political and economic goals of the Chinese government.\\\"\", \"\\\"We believe this activity is highly likely to be a state actor as the observed long-term targeted intrusions into high-value government and political targets is consistent with cyberespionage activity, coupled with identified technical links to known Chinese state-sponsored activity,\\\" the company said.\", \"Insikt said all of the affected countries were notified of the findings in October.
