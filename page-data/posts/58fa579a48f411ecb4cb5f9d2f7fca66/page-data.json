chief have all disappeared in China in recent years.\", \"The\\u00a0latest high-profile casualty is one of the country's biggest sport stars,\\u00a0tennis player Peng Shuai.\", \"Ms Peng went missing earlier this month after claiming on social media that\\u00a0a former member of China's Politburo Standing Committee, Zhang Gaoli, coerced her into sex\\u00a0and that they later had an on-off consensual relationship.\", \"But an email published this week by\\u00a0China's global TV network, CGTN, said to have been sent by Ms Peng to\\u00a0Women's Tennis Association (WTA) chairman\\u00a0Steve Simon, said the 35-year-old was\\u00a0\\\"not missing, nor am I unsafe\\\".\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I've just been resting at home and everything is fine,\\\" the email stated.\", \"The email said the allegation of sexual assault was \\\"not true\\\".\", \"We've seen similar scenarios play out many times before \\u2013\\u00a0a public figure who speaks out against the

came to power in 2012 there has been little room for dissent in China, and he has made it clear that no matter how rich, famous or powerful you are, no-one is beyond the reach of

minority groups alone it could be upwards of a million people.\", \"When taking power, Mr Xi\\u00a0introduced new laws that essentially made arbitrary and secret detentions legal under Chinese law.\", \"Regardless of citizenship, these complex laws can be used to strip detainees of their rights on the grounds of \\\"national security\\\".\", \"There is speculation over what happens to people when they go missing.\", \"For the high-profile, it may be a case of being forced to lay low, while others can be held in custody under the \\\"residential surveillance at a designated location\\\" scheme, which cuts suspects off from the outside world.\", \"The location for the residential\\u00a0surveillance scheme\\u00a0is usually a facility\\u00a0run by the secret police, and can involve a person being held in solitary confinement and subjected to continuous interrogations.\", \"But this form of detention is usually used for those\\u00a0accused of endangering state security.\", \"<div

missing\\u00a0three months after giving a controversial speech in late 2020 where he\\u00a0blasted China's regulatory system.\", \"The disappearance of Mr Ma, who had been ranked by Forbes as China's richest person and was adoringly referred to by many as \\\"Daddy Ma\\\", sparked a wave of international attention.\", \"Mr Ma\\u00a0reappeared in a short video for a charity event in\\u00a0January

\"While high-profile disappearances have become common, Dr Pichamon Yeophantong, a political scientist and China expert at UNSW Canberra, said Ms Peng's case stood out.\", \"She said that was

country.\", \"Terms like \\\"feminism\\\"\\u00a0and \\\"MeToo\\\" are considered sensitive\\u00a0and are subject to online censorship, and dozens of feminist accounts have been abruptly shut down on popular social media sites like Weibo and Douban.\", \"Dr\\u00a0Yeophantong said there had been some growth in\\u00a0grassroots women's rights movements, but much of it was still constrained by political and traditional culture, with the younger generation voicing grievances that \\\"there's still a sense of superficiality\\\".\", \"\\\"For such a tennis star to disappear, in a country that
