As co-founders, we're all farmers and we actually came at this thinking it would be an incredible plant to add diverse income to farms, but also to be beneficial to the soils in the land that we farm.\\\"\", \"The garments are also an alternative to fast-fashion, O'Malley said, as they're biodegradable at the end of life.\", \"\\\"That's one of the key drivers for us. There's nothing worse than looking at those giant piles of garments in a landfill that are just never going to biodegrade, they're never going anywhere,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Lots of people don't realise that in some merino products, that beautiful natural fibre is blended with an acrylic and as a result, it's not biodegradable - it lives forever.\", \"\\\"That's really what motivated us to try and look for alternatives to that and what led us to hemp fibre.\", \"\\\"I think people are starting to wake up to the idea that natural fibres are nicer to wear, they're more pleasant next to your body, they last a long time. And also when they're done, effectively you could put them in the compost heap and they would biodegrade and return to the soil.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"3581b646bb8911ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3581b646bb8911ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
