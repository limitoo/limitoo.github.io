A good night\\u2019s sleep? Good luck. That can wait.\", \"When Houston\\u2019s Dusty Baker decided to move the slumping Alex Bregman down to seventh in the lineup for Game 5 against Atlanta on Sunday, it was not a thunderbolt idea that struck as he was filling out the lineup card in his office before the game.\", \"\\u201cUsually, the thoughts come to me in the middle of the night, like most of them do,\\u201d Baker said. That\\u2019s exactly when the Bregman idea hatched, he said, overnight Saturday, \\u201cwhen I should have been sleeping.\\u201d\", \"His Atlanta counterpart, Brian Snitker, can relate.\", \"\\u201cYou toss and turn and wake up and go to the bathroom, I get a lot of things the same way,\\u201d Snitker said on the field before Game 6 on Tuesday. \\u201cOr if you think of something, you want to sleep on it and see how you feel the next day. There\\u2019s been stuff that comes to me in the middle of the night. It\\u2019s just one of those instinctual things that hits you.\\u201d\", \"These middle-of-the-night moments come two at a time, packaged during the week or 10 days\\u2019 worth of heavy pressure and light sleep. Beyond the two managers leading the current teams, there are a select few other men who know exactly what this whirlwind experience is like.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re so busy,\\u201d said Bruce Bochy, who guided the San Francisco Giants to World Series titles in 2010, 2012 and 2014. \\u201cYou have so many responsibilities. Your time is when you get away from the park and back to your room at night.\\u201d\", \"But even then, a manager is not so alone.\", \"\\u201cWhen you lay your head down, that\\u2019s when your head starts to work,\\u201d Bochy said.\", \"By day, World Series managers face responsibilities with their baseball operations departments, players and coaches. They are heavily scheduled for news media interviews and television obligations. There are fleeting moments for family members in town to help share these moments of a lifetime. There are ticket requests that can become consuming. The days seem too short for a manager to cover every detail while also attempting enjoy the culmination of a life\\u2019s work.\", \"By night, alone with their thoughts and the latest game result churning in their stomachs, managers often find their brains working overtime to find peace amid a cacophony of sleep-delaying obstacles that can include distant, poignant family memories, television remote controls, Scotch and, even, peanut butter.\", \"\\u201cThese things, they come to me, and you can\\u2019t really control when they come,\\u201d Baker said of the thoughts that dance through his mind at night. \\u201cLike my dad used to tell me, some things you\\u2019ve got to sleep on. So I\\u2019ll try to sleep on it.\\u201d\", \"Managers have slept on worse during a World Series. Cleveland\\u2019s Terry Francona revealed on the day of Game 7 against the Chicago Cubs in 2016 that he had a terrible nightmare the night before, dreaming that somebody \\u201cwas breaking my ribs.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI woke up and my ribs hurt,\\u201d Francona said then. \\u201cI kind of got scared.\\u201d\", \"As he was regaining consciousness, he said, he reached down to feel his rib cage and discovered no broken bones, but that the TV remote was \\u201clike, stuck in my rib cage. Evidently, I had slept on it for a couple of hours. I got up to go to the bathroom and, I mean, it hurt.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not easy being a manager. My bedroom looked like a national disaster last night.\\u201d\", \"That wasn\\u2019t the end of it. Francona also woke up with peanut butter on his glasses, he said, because he had been dipping pretzels into a jar of peanut butter as he fell asleep in bed.\", \"\\u201cI go straight home and I hit the bed and everything\\u2019s laid out next to me,\\u201d Francona said. \\u201cAnd I fell asleep at some point while eating. I wake up sometimes in the middle of the night, and I\\u2019ll just reach over and grab something. Unfortunately, it\\u2019s true.\\u201d\", \"Baker said he generally enjoys one glass of Scotch before bed \\u2014 \\u201cI don\\u2019t need it, I just like it\\u201d \\u2014 and falls asleep quickly. But he called himself a \\u201cmid-sleep insomniac,\\u201d as diagnosed by a friend of his who is a clinical psychologist.\", \"\\u201cI wake up in the middle of the night,\\u201d Baker said. \\u201cI can go to sleep in 30 seconds, but then 3, 3:30 in the morning, my brain wakes me up with lineup changes or thoughts that I have to say to somebody or something. I always keep a pencil or pen by my bed and a piece of paper and write it down or else I\\u2019ll forget some of those great thoughts that I had in the middle of the night when I should be asleep.\\u201d\", \"Bochy understands.\", \"\\u201cThings are going through your head constantly,\\u201d Bochy said. \\u201cAfter the game you\\u2019ve got the media and everything, and by the time you get back to the hotel you\\u2019ve got all kinds of thoughts that can maybe help the club \\u2014 a lineup change, going through your pitching, thoughts on what you want to convey to the club. Your mind is going nonstop, and it continues into the next day.\\u201d\", \"He vividly remembers the night before Game 7 in Kansas City in 2014. \\u201cWe got smoked in Game 6,\\u201d Bochy recalled \\u2014 10-0, in a game that evened the series at three games apiece.\", \"\\u201cSo you get back to the room and you\\u2019re thinking, \\u2018OK, how are we going to work through this? We\\u2019ve got Tim Hudson starting Game 7, how can we use Bumgarner?\\u2019\\u201d Bochy said. \\u201cAll of this is going through your head.\\u201d\", \"Of course, in one of the more memorable moments of any World Series, after Hudson went one and two-thirds innings the next day and Jeremy Affeldt bridged the next two and a third innings, the Kauffman Stadium bullpen gate swung open and Madison Bumgarner emerged. After throwing a shutout three days before, Bumgarner shut down the Royals over the last five innings as the Giants won their third title in five years.\", \"Sorting through those thoughts in his hotel room on a Tuesday night in Kansas City did not cost Bochy as much sleep as his first time piloting the Giants in the World Series, when they took a lead of three games to one over Texas in 2010. That\\u2019s when his brother, Joe, starting kidding him: If you blow this one \\u2026\", \"\\u201cListen, I didn\\u2019t sleep at all that night,\\u201d Bochy said. \\u201cYou just lay there tossing and turning. Morning comes and you\\u2019ve got to get up.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re running on adrenaline. Adrenaline is a wonderful drug.\\u201d\", \"Though he is managing a World Series for the first time, Snitker said he learned long ago that sleep is at a premium.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s probably one of the hardest things you have to encounter here after experiencing it,\\u201d he acknowledged. \\u201cThe games are so long, the days are so long. It\\u2019s hard to get to bed at a decent hour. You\\u2019re never hungry. And you don\\u2019t sleep good. I sleep like a baby: I wake up every two hours and cry.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to get into the routines and all that stuff. But you know what? I wouldn\\u2019t have it any other way. I\\u2019ll have a time to sleep over the next couple days.\\u201d\", \"When Snitker and his wife, Ronnie, were talking earlier this year about his eventual retirement, she told him that it would be nice when he doesn\\u2019t wake up worrying about something every morning.\", \"\\u201cYeah, but I\\u2019m really good at worrying,\\u201d Brian told her, chuckling.\"]","href_hash":"4a064dd83c6e11ecb695000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4a064dd83c6e11ecb695000017025a03"}},
