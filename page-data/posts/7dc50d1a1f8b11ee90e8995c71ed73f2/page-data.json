Roads were closed across the state, including many along the spine of the Green Mountains.\", \"Some people canoed their way to the Cavendish Baptist Church in Vermont, which had turned into a shelter.

It's just stressful,\\\" shelter volunteer Amanda Gross said.\", \"Vermont Rep. Kelly Pajala said she and about half a dozen others had to evacuate early Monday from a four-unit apartment building on the West River in Londonderry.\", \"\\\"The river was at our doorstep,\\\" said Pajala. \\\"We threw some dry clothes and our cats into the car and drove to higher ground.\\\"\", \"U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned Monday evening that it expected two dams in Vermont \\u2014 the Ball Mountain Dam in Jamaica and the Townshend Dam in the Townshend/Windham area \\u2014 to release \\\"large quantities of water over their spillways. This will result in severe flooding downstream of the dam.\\\"\", \"\\\"We anticipate floodwaters to increase rapidly overnight, and we recommend taking precautions now. We encourage everyone to follow the guidance from their local emergency management officials,\\\" the Corps' New England District tweeted.\", \"The slow-moving storm reached New England in the morning after hitting parts of New York and Connecticut on Sunday.

The additional warming that scientists predict is coming will only make it worse.\", \"The storm also interrupted air and rail travel. There were hundreds of flight cancellations at Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark airports and more than 200 canceled at Boston's Logan Airport in the last 24 hours, according to the Flightaware website.
