So, this project will be beneficial in continuing to evolve and learn so much more in the aerodynamic realm which was a significant factor in AC36.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/287095/eight_col_m4807_211222_ETNZ_26438.jpg?1645296863\\\" alt=\\\"Emirates Team New Zealand Wind Powered Land Speed World Record design and planning\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nTeam New Zealand Wind Powered Land Speed World Record design and planning \\nPhoto: Emirates Team New Zealand\\n</div>\", \"The obvious element of uncertainty and point of difference for all the Team New Zealand designers is tyre technology and the dynamic forces associated with tyres on the ground, as opposed to hydrodynamic forces on foils in the water.\", \"\\\"This is the big unknown for us,\\\" explained TNZ Mechanical Engineer Tim Meldrum.\", \"\\\"Tyres on a flat salt surface going at over 200km/h is a whole lot different to foils in the water at over 50 knots. The rules stipulate we must run on a flat natural surface. The best ones we know of where it can be windy are dry salt lakes. With the tyres being the only point of contact to the salt it is a pretty important factor in finding the sweet spot in maintaining sufficient grip- with the least amount of rolling resistance.\\\"\", \"Another contradictory problem to the norm in the America's Cup is around weight.\", \"In the AC75's the less weight in the boat the easier it will be to fly and faster it will be.\", \"With a land yacht, weight is a positive in certain respects according to construction manager Sean Regan.\", \"\\\"In land speed, weight will be our friend if used in the right location. So, we can refine our construction techniques that account for additional weight in certain aspects and not be so focused on weight savings. On the outrigger pod we are actively adding weight or ballast to counter the wind force on the wing sail, without which, the craft would just tip over. Not something we want for Glenn approaching such high speeds.\\\"\", \"It is these sorts of design problems that will have to be overcome in the typically condensed lead up to a shot at the World Record in July or early August which Ashby and the team are working towards attempting on one of Australia's vast salt lakes with Lake Gairdner in South Australia or Lake Lefroy in Western Australia as potential locations.\", \"Any world record needs to be stringently verified and will require officials from the North America Land Speed Association to measure and record the run with a specific set of rules that must be adhered to in order to qualify for the World Record.\"]","href_hash":"a07cf9ce926c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a07cf9ce926c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
