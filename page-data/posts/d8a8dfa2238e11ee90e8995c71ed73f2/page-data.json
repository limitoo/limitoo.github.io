We had some other things that weren't that great, but I like the fact that we were able to still win the game.\\\"\", \"One area in which Cheika is looking to improve the side in his second year in charge is the attack and, although the Pumas wasted a fair few overlaps, he was happy with how that part of their game looked.\", \"\\\"We're trying to work out how we can play with more possession but still have balance around our game,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"The attacking side of the game is something that we definitely need to improve from last year.
