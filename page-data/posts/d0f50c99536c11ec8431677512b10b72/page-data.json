No surprise there, I guess. Twelve months ago, the year began with promise, but we\\u2019ve hardly returned to old comforts. Rather than breaking out, we spent 2021 getting used to a feeling of unquiet, making the most of being mostly alone. The best improvised music of the year understood that, and met us there.\", \"Why fight it: This year\\u2019s big talker in the experimental-music world ended up being just as powerful as we\\u2019d hoped. Not really jazz, not exactly classical, definitely not electronic music per se, \\u201cPromises\\u201d is the first-ever collaboration between Pharoah Sanders, the octogenarian spiritual-jazz eminence, and Floating Points, nee Sam Shepherd, a 30-something British composer and polymath. They each use music to get at questions of healing \\u2014 Shepherd typically as a solo musician, Sanders as a communitarian \\u2014 and although \\u201cPromises\\u201d was recorded before the coronavirus pandemic began, it arrived a year into lockdown, just when we needed it most.\", \"A pianist, visual artist, curator, writer and guiding force in jazz, Jason Moran has been quietly releasing albums on his Bandcamp over the past few years, after ending a lengthy relationship with Blue Note Records. He doesn\\u2019t have a publicist, and barely self-promotes beyond his personal social media feeds, but these releases are worth seeking out. Moran recorded \\u201cThe Sound Will Tell You\\u201d alone in January, just as he was mounting an exhibition of deep-blue works on paper at Luhring Augustine in Tribeca. This is an intimate and tender, harmonically lush piano record, heavily inspired by the writings of Toni Morrison, blurred occasionally by electronic effects but always clear in its melodic intent. (Listen to \\u201cThe Sound Will Tell You\\u201d on Bandcamp.)\", \"The tenor saxophonist James Brandon Lewis tends to blow hard into his horn, but he likes to save up extra breath in the bottom of his lungs, so that his notes don\\u2019t necessarily fade, but sometimes grow louder and stronger over time. It\\u2019s a way of broadcasting patience and urgency all at once, and reminding you that he\\u2019s in control. After years of mounting buzz, Lewis cashed in his chips with \\u201cJesup Wagon.\\u201d The album\\u2019s seven original compositions \\u2014 composed for an unorthodox quintet, with the life of George Washington Carver in mind \\u2014 are built around yawning, polyphonic melodies (Lewis\\u2019s saxophone intertwined with Kirk Knuffke\\u2019s cornet) and layers of rhythm stacked underneath (William Parker\\u2019s bass and guimbri, Christopher Hoffman\\u2019s cello and Chad Taylor\\u2019s drums and mbira).\", \"Twinkling and mesmeric, the debut album from this Mexican-born, New York-based vibraphonist and marimba player mixes composed material with tracks that were improvised in the studio whole cloth. Some are retouched with echoey, scrambling effects, but none is particularly lush or layered. Moving way outside the standard language of jazz vibraphone, Patricia Brennan has created something like a landscape of vapor, full of wandering melodies lost in the fog.\", \"Weaving, pulsing, fine-grain complexity, intense focus: They\\u2019re all at play in the trumpeter Adam O\\u2019Farrill\\u2019s tangled compositions. On \\u201cVisions of Your Other,\\u201d his third album with his quartet, Stranger Days (featuring Xavier Del Castillo on tenor saxophone, Walter Stinson on bass and Zack O\\u2019Farrill on drums), the group slips into the music like a perfectly tailored suit.\", \"Sam Gendel, a saxophonist, and Sam Wilkes, a bassist, are millennial pals who seem equally interested in using music for the purposes of comfort and disruption. In 2018, they put out \\u201cMusic for Saxofone and Bass Guitar,\\u201d a stealthy little album that might have spluttered out of a vat where time, space, genre and the titular instruments themselves had all melted down into a roux. Recorded live to tape and released on Bandcamp, it became an underground obsession. Their follow-up LP, \\u201cMore Songs,\\u201d contains nine additional tracks in the same vein, and it\\u2019s at least as hypnotic as the first.\", \"The bassist, composer and organizer William Parker\\u2019s five-decade career sends a galvanizing message: Yes, you can do it all. You can play in and outside of any improvising style you choose; you can lead and you can follow; you can play the bass like a heavy rhythm instrument while coaxing grace and lyric from it. \\u201cMigration of Silence Into and Out of the Tone World\\u201d is not one new LP, but in fact 10, each featuring Parker\\u2019s original music recorded with a different collaborator or band. So it works as a measure of his enormous range, and an index of his network on the downtown avant-garde \\u2014 a scene that would hardly be the same without him.\", \"Sara Serpa, a Portuguese singer whose voice is both small and bold, has spent the past few years immersing herself in the shocking history of Portugal\\u2019s colonial misadventures on the African continent, and responding through music. On \\u201cIntimate Strangers,\\u201d she collaborates with Emmanuel Iduma, a Nigerian memoirist and critic, who has written in evocative detail about the experiences of migrant laborers on the continent today. Through him, Serpa found a way to explore the present-day legacy of colonialism, while usefully decentering her own perspective. But the music remains distinctly Serpa\\u2019s: cool-toned, vocal-driven, abstract and yet immediately beautiful.\", \"Nearing 80, Wadada Leo Smith retains one of the fullest and most arresting trumpet sounds around. But playing alongside him means getting in touch with silence, too, as if there might be energy coming from his horn that hasn\\u2019t yet become sound but still needs room to breathe. The saxophonist and multi-instrumentalist Douglas R. Ewart \\u2014 who, like Smith, moved to Chicago in the 1960s and became an early member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians \\u2014 brings a similarly restful approach to improvisation. Working with the younger Chicagoan drummer Mike Reed, Smith and Ewart created an album of expanse and vision that lives up to its name. (Listen to \\u201cSun Beams of Shimmering Light\\u201d on Bandcamp.)\", \"\\u201cSongwrights Apothecary Lab\\u201d takes the form of an album here, but it began as more than that (and it\\u2019s likely to continue as more, too). Esperanza Spalding, the bassist, vocalist and self-described \\u201csongwright,\\u201d held residencies in New York and her native Oregon during the pandemic, bringing together a mix of healers and artists in search of new and therapeutic methods of making music. Each of the LP\\u2019s 12 tracks is a \\u201cformwela,\\u201d blending lyrical and wordless vocals, instrumental textures and hooks that condense out of thin air.\"]","href_hash":"d0f50c99536c11ec8431677512b10b72"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d0f50c99536c11ec8431677512b10b72"}},
