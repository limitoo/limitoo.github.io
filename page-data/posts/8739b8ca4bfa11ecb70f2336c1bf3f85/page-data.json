Mr. Cruz, now 23, pleaded guilty to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder last month. He is scheduled to go on trial early next year. A jury will decide if he faces capital punishment or life imprisonment.\", \"\\u201cAlthough the financial details of the agreement are presently confidential, it is an historic settlement and the culmination of the Parkland families\\u2019 long and arduous efforts toward truth and accountability,\\u201d the law firm representing the families, Podhurst Orseck, said in a statement.\", \"The Justice Department said in court papers that it was in the process of completing a settlement, without disclosing the amount. Two people familiar with the case said it would total about $130 million, though the precise number could change before the final agreement.\", \"The revelation that the F.B.I. had received information about the gunman ahead of the shooting devastated victims\\u2019 families and the Parkland community in the days immediately following the shooting. Fred Guttenberg was picking out a casket for his 14-year-old daughter, Jaime, two days after the shooting when he got an urgent call from an F.B.I. agent working with the families. The agent delivered the difficult news.\", \"\\u201cAre you telling me that if the F.B.I. did not make a mistake and did their job a month sooner, my daughter would still be alive today?\\u201d Mr. Guttenberg asked the agent, according to the lawsuit Mr. Guttenberg and the 39 other families eventually filed against the bureau.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m afraid so, sir,\\u201d the agent replied, according to Mr. Guttenberg.\", \"The first tip had come five months before the shooting, in September 2017, when a bail bondsman in Mississippi reported that a commentator with the user name \\u201cnikolas cruz\\u201d had left a disturbing message on his YouTube channel: \\u201cIm going to be a professional school shooter,\\u201d it read. Two F.B.I. agents interviewed the bondsman about the comment but found no particular information linking it to a specific person and closed the inquiry the following month.\", \"The second tip came on Jan. 5, 2018, from a woman who called the F.B.I.\\u2019s tip line and gave the bureau information about Mr. Cruz\\u2019s social media accounts and troubled family life and school record. She mentioned that he had posted photos of mutilated animals and that his mother had died recently \\u2014 both considered by experts to be warning signs or triggers for potential shooters.\", \"\\u201cI do believe something\\u2019s going to happen,\\u201d said the woman, who identified herself as a family friend.\", \"Mr. Guttenberg and his wife, Jennifer Guttenberg, sued the F.B.I. for negligence in November 2018 and were eventually joined by 39 other families. They argued that the shooting had been \\u201ccompletely preventable.\\u201d\", \"The case had been scheduled to go to trial in January 2022. In its court filing on Monday, the Justice Department asked the court for a stay of all upcoming hearings and deadlines pending completion of the settlement.\", \"\\u201cOnce those details are finalized and approval is granted, the plaintiffs will ask that the court dismiss these actions in their entirety,\\u201d the Justice Department filing said.\", \"The Justice Department had no further comment.\", \"Last month, victims\\u2019 families reached a $25 million settlement with the Broward County school district.\"]","href_hash":"8739b8ca4bfa11ecb70f2336c1bf3f85"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8739b8ca4bfa11ecb70f2336c1bf3f85"}},
