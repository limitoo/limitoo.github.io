You might need what Powers calls a personal moniker for a letterhead, thank-you notes, to sign artwork or legal documents. Powers says the emblem should represent an aspect of yourself that goes back to a childlike state, something that is a simple visual extension of who you are. \\u201cLet your 3-year-old inner self take the wheel and draw something,\\u201d Powers says. \\u201cYou can get into this mind-set by drawing right when you\\u2019re out of a nap.\\u201d He recommends a midday nap for which you take off your socks, get under the covers and fall into a good deep sleep \\u2014 \\u201cthen when you\\u2019re out, you\\u2019re ready.\\u201d A nap helps you free associate without questioning the designing you do.\", \"Grab any kind of marking implement \\u2014 a pencil or crayon or even a feather or avocado pit. \\u201cIt\\u2019s important not to think at first, but to just start with the things you immediately know about yourself,\\u201d Powers says. These could be your name or initials or an image, like an animal silhouette or a slice of pizza. \\u201cThink about what you love,\\u201d he says. \\u201cWhat animates you? What gets you feeling excited and feeling good?\\u201d Simple actions and clear lines are best.\", \"A logo shouldn\\u2019t be complicated; you want your mark to be easily recognizable. Powers uses the example of a recent workshop attendee \\u2014 a young child named Kiki: \\u201cShe instinctually wrote a backward K and a forward K, then what would have been the straight line of each of those Ks was a single line that they shared. It was a very clever visualization of the name \\u2018Kiki.\\u2019\\u201d Powers, who goes by Espo, has refined his personal symbol to be a simple cursive signature that ends in a bird.\", \"Once your symbol is out of your head and on paper, draw and redraw it. \\u201cRefine it, reduce it, expand it and memorize it \\u2014 you want it to be something that just becomes an extension of who you are, and that happens with repetition,\\u201d Powers says. Once you\\u2019ve done this, consider making a rubber stamp or digital file of it. \\u201cIntegrate it in small and large ways throughout your life,\\u201d he says.\", \"\"]","href_hash":"a0398eae51c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a0398eae51c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}},
