So the key message for us is just to ensure that we're following guidelines,\\\" says Keith Ikin, Maniapoto M\\u0101ori Trust Board chairperson.\", \"But testing sites were virtually empty on Friday, with the holiday period blamed for putting people off coming in.\", \"Vaccination rates make better reading, with local M\\u0101ori approaching that 90 percent second dose target.\", \"\\\"We are one of the probably leading districts in rural New Zealand in terms of vaccinations. First doses, we're at 95 percent. With second doses for M\\u0101ori are at 80 percent, the general population is 90 percent. So it's fantastic,\\\" says Waitomo district mayor John Robertson.\", \"Forty-five percent of the almost 5000 there are M\\u0101ori. Community leaders say they face similar challenges to wh\\u0101nau living in south Auckland and worry it could lead to more cases.\", \"\\\"The combination of those two things - a home environment and multiple generations, large families in small homes, and then a small group of employers that employ a large number of the working population - that combination makes it quite challenging,\\\" Ikin says.\", \"The community is working with iwi to help curb the spread and has a simple New Year's message: test, test, test.\"]","href_hash":"542b54d06a0811ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"542b54d06a0811ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
