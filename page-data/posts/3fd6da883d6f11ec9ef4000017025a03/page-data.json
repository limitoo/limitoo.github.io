This correlation could be used to develop water as a tracer of star formation, which could then be applied to galaxies on a cosmological scale.\\\"\", \"Studying early galaxies like those in SPT0311-58 helps researchers to investigate the conditions in the early Universe. This in turn leads to a better understanding of how galaxies, stars, and eventually planets like our own, form and evolve.\", \"\\\"Early galaxies are forming stars at a rate thousands of times that of the Milky Way,\\\" said Jarugula. \\\"Studying the gas and dust content of these early galaxies informs us of their properties, such as how many stars are being formed, the rate at which gas is converted into stars, how galaxies interact with each other and with the interstellar medium, and more.\\\"\", \"Despite arriving at this important detection of water molecules in the largest galaxy of SPT0311-58, Jarugula believes that his team and ALMA, comprised of 66 radio telescopes spread across the Atacama Desert region of northern Chile, are far from done with this duo of galaxies.\", \"\\\"This study not only provides answers about where, and how far away, water can exist in the Universe but also has given rise to a big question, how has so much gas and dust assembled to form stars and galaxies so early in the Universe?\\\" Jarugula concludes.\", \"\\\"The answer requires further study of these and similar star-forming galaxies to get a better understanding of the structural formation and evolution of the early Universe.\\\"\", \"Astrophysicist and ALMA Program Director at the National Science Foundation, Joe Pesce was not involved in the current research. He said: \\\"This exciting result, which shows the power of ALMA, adds to a growing collection of observations of the early Universe.\", \"\\\"These molecules, important to life on Earth, are forming as soon as they can, and their observation is giving us insight into the fundamental processes of a Universe very much different from today's.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926013/galaxies-spt0311-58.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">An illustration of the pair of galaxies that make up SPT0311-58.
