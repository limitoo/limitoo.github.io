It's clear the terrorist had spent a great deal of time in the deepest recesses of the web, spiralling into extremism. And so two months after the attack, alongside France, we brought together heads of state and government and leaders from the tech sector to adopt the Christchurch Call, to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online.\\u201d\", \"According to Ardern, the Christchurch Call community is growing, with dozens of countries and online service providers having signed up.\", \"\\u201cWe pledged to work with each other and with civil society to tackle the underlying causes of terrorism and violent extremism and to develop technical solutions that improve the online environment, and make social media platforms less hospitable to terrorists and violent extremists. We have made substantial progress but the work continues, including on our own social cohesion agenda.\\u201d\", \"But the sense that much more work is needed to prevent a repeat of something like the mosque attacks was spelt out clearly by the Greens MP Golriz Ghahraman who warned that history repeatedly showed that if left unchecked, hate speech begets atrocities.\", \"She lamented the way that police and national security agencies failed to see the threat posed by white supremacists before 15 March 2019 because they were more focussed on the perceived threat of the Muslim community itself as well as M\\u0101ori activists. Meanwhile,\\u00a0problems of hate fester\\u00a0on.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/135102/eight_col_Golriz_Ghahraman.jpg?1512614819\\\" alt=\\\"Green MP Golriz Ghahraman on the Foreign Affairs, Defence, and Trade select committee. \\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nGreen MP Golriz Ghahraman on the Foreign Affairs, Defence, and Trade select committee.  \\nPhoto: VNP / Daniela Maoate-Cox\\n</div>\", \"\\u201cEvery minority in New Zealand knows that threat in online spaces and bleeding into our everyday lives. Our Muslim wh\\u0101nau, M\\u0101ori - our East Asian and Pacific communities saw it with the racist threats after Covid - our rainbow community, trans women. And it spreads online. As leaders, we have to stop and listen.\", \"\\u201cThe truth is that this is a global phenomenon\\u2014disinformation deliberately spread, eventually radicalising and making us all unsafe. We can no longer depend on the goodwill of online platforms to police themselves. Facebook doesn't care about our marginalised communities. Twitter doesn't care. Google and YouTube only took down that video on the day because they were forced,\\u201d Ghahraman said.\", \"\\u201cThe violence and vitriol of the recent protests outside Parliament with elements of far-right hate, with signs of white supremacy, taking advantage of disillusion, grifting disinformation, is a perfect example of that. The royal commission told us we need hate speech laws. We need hate crimes defined. The New Zealand Police wants that. It's time to act. That is what compassion would look like.\\\"\", \"Recognising a positive to come out of what is now forged in the country\\u2019s history as a day of utter horror and pain,\\u00a0 Labour MP Ibrahim\\u00a0Omer cited the values displayed by New Zealand in the immediate aftermath of the attacks.\", \"\\u201cI think of our community organisations who dropped everything they were doing and rushed to offer their services to the impacted communities. Finally, I think of all New Zealanders who were at home and went out into their local communities and wrapped their arms around their neighbours and communities,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cIt's important to remember that the terrorist utterly failed. The plan to turn the whole country against each other was fruitless.\\u201d\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/272337/eight_col_Ibrahim_Omer_20210812-0O9A6874.JPG?1629070653\\\" alt=\\\"Ibrahim Omer in the House\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nIbrahim Omer in the House \\nPhoto: \\u00a9VNP / Phil Smith\\n</div>\", \"The mosque attacks bookend a chaotic three years in which the government has had to grapple not only with terrorism, but a major natural disaster, an ongoing pandemic, a war wreaking havoc on the economy and, quite recently, an occupation of parliament grounds by a dishevelled protest hijacked by extremists.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s no doubt the last three or four years have been incredibly disruptive both in New Zealand and around the world. The word \\u2018unprecedented\\u2019 has been used very widely and I think quite appropriately,\\u201d said the Leader of the House, Chris Hipkins.\", \"\\u201cI never would have imagined that we\\u2019d be confronting so many things in rapid succession.
