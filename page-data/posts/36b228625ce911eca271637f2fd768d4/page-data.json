Mr. Rushfield, the founder of The Ankler, which bills itself as \\u201cthe newsletter Hollywood loves to hate and hates to love,\\u201d will be the company\\u2019s editorial director and chief columnist.\", \"\\u201cOne of the things that really sold me on doing this with Richard is he gave me visibility into the subscriber list, and it\\u2019s insane,\\u201d Ms. Min said in an interview. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a Who\\u2019s Who of power in the entertainment community, and from that base I feel like there is so much potential to exercise that level of influence.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Rushfield wrote for BuzzFeed, The Los Angeles Times and Gawker before going solo with a newsletter in 2017, a move he made because he felt there was room for coverage that was \\u201csharper-elbowed, more irreverent and more fun than what was out there,\\u201d he said.\", \"The Ankler started as something he wrote to amuse his friends. Eventually, he moved it to the digital newsletter platform Substack, and he now charges $10 a month for a subscription. According to Substack\\u2019s public leaderboard, which ranks newsletters by revenue, it is in the platform\\u2019s top three business publications.\", \"\\u201cSo have you met Americans lately or the entertainment consumers of the world?\\u201d he wrote in Monday\\u2019s edition, on the disappointing box-office results for Steven Spielberg\\u2019s big-budget adaptation of \\u201cWest Side Story.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt may shock you to learn that they aren\\u2019t versed in the history of midcentury American musical theater,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cThe mass culture as it stands can barely remember who Katy Perry was and won\\u2019t take kindly to anyone pointing out to them that entertainment existed in a time before that.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Min said she first saw The Ankler\\u2019s potential for expansion after reading a post by Mr. Rushfield on the lack of diversity in the executive ranks at film studios, which included screenshots of \\u201cAbout Us\\u201d pages that showed mostly white leadership teams.\", \"Over the last 18 months, Ms. Min and Mr. Rushfield discussed ways to expand the newsletter, including with other media companies, before deciding to stick with Substack. They said they planned to keep The Ankler as the flagship and would introduce additional newsletters, as well as podcasts and events, starting in January. \", \"They will also bring on new hires, with the first being Tatiana Siegel, the executive film editor of The Hollywood Reporter, who will join in January to report on the worlds of Hollywood and entertainment.\", \"Ms. Min and Mr. Rushfield said the company would be part of a three-month program run by Y Combinator, a start-up incubator known for its early investments in Airbnb and Reddit. The program gives company founders seed money and business guidance.\", \"A focus of Ankler Media\\u2019s coverage will be the clashes between the tech executives now making big decisions in Hollywood and the ones who have been around since moviegoers waited in line to buy tickets.\", \"\\u201cThat push-pull tension between the people who eat McCarthy Salads at the Polo Lounge with the Silicon Valley algorithm people \\u2014 that\\u2019s a real tension that\\u2019s going to drive the next 10, 20, 30 years here,\\u201d Ms. Min said.\"]","href_hash":"36b228625ce911eca271637f2fd768d4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"36b228625ce911eca271637f2fd768d4"}},
