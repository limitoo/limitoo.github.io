The answer among coffee drinkers varies, but the vast majority would pay somewhere in the range of one to five dollars. About one in 10 wouldn't pay more than a dollar for a cup of coffee, while 16% are willing to pay upwards of five dollars for a cup.\\u00a0\", \"Most Americans, however, avoid paying for coffee by brewing most of the coffee they drink themselves. Fifty-seven percent brew most of their own coffee, though about one in five say they buy most of the coffee they drink from coffee shops or caf\\u00e9s. Another one in five adults say they don't drink coffee at all. \\u00a0\", \"Younger adults under 30 are particularly likely to buy the coffee they drink from a shop:\\u00a0 43% do so, a higher percentage than those who brew most of the coffee they drink themselves. Most adults 30 and older brew most of the coffee they drink. \\u00a0\", \"Those who buy most of their coffee from shops and caf\\u00e9s are willing to pay more for the privilege of doing so. 12% of those who mostly brew their own coffee would pay five dollars for a cup, but this rises to 29% of those who mostly buy their coffee from a coffee shop. \\u00a0\", \"This poll was conducted by telephone November 9-14, 2021 among a random sample of 1,008 adults nationwide.\\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, PA.\\u202f Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. \\u00a0\", \"The poll employed a random digit dial methodology.
