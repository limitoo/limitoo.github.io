Did you see Taylor Swift perform \\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d on \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d last weekend? Even if you don\\u2019t count yourself a \\u201cSwiftie,\\u201d it\\u2019s worth 10 minutes of your time.\", \"On Friday, Swift released \\u201cRed (Taylor\\u2019s Version),\\u201d a rerecording of her 2012 album, \\u201cRed,\\u201d on which \\u201cAll Too Well,\\u201d an indictment of a relationship in its aftermath (sample lyric: \\u201cAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own/Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone\\u201d), originally appeared.\", \"\\u201cThe five-and-a-half-minute cut of \\u2018All Too Well\\u2019 that appeared on \\u2018Red\\u2019 was an achievement of taut, streamlined storytelling and vividly spot-lit details,\\u201d writes Lindsay Zoladz. \\u201cThe new version knows no such restraint. It is gloriously unruly and viciously seething. With its release, the millennial \\u2018You\\u2019re So Vain\\u2019 has suddenly become the millennial \\u2018Idiot Wind.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAll Too Well (Taylor\\u2019s Version)\\u201d is a weepie \\u2014 a belt-the-lyrics, crying-while-driving tune. It\\u2019s a song for the heartbroken, for the fed-up, for the older and wiser who\\u2019ve seen some things they\\u2019re not going to forget any time soon. I won\\u2019t go so far as to say it\\u2019s an anthem for the moment \\u2014 a pop song about a breakup, even a good one, doesn\\u2019t begin to encompass the events of the past two years \\u2014 but it\\u2019s a song for letting it all out, a song of catharsis. As Jason Farago wrote in The Times in January, about the release that art can provide, \\u201cNot since 1945 has the United States required catharsis like it does in 2021.\\u201d Have a listen.\", \"Do you have a catharsis song?
