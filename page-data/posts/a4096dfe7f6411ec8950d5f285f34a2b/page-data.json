William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall did not do so either, retiring during George H.W. Bush\\u2019s presidency instead of trying to wait for the 1992 election. And Earl Warren, the liberal chief justice of the 1950s and \\u201960s, announced his retirement so late in Lyndon Johnson\\u2019s presidency that Richard Nixon was able to fill the slot after Johnson fumbled the nomination process.\", \"These forfeited liberal court seats are a central reason that conservatives now dominate the court. Democrats and Republicans have held the White House for a similar number of years in recent decades, yet Republican appointees hold six of the Supreme Court\\u2019s nine seats.\", \"Circumstance has definitely played a role, too \\u2014 and the sample size of Supreme Court justices is so small that it\\u2019s hard to be confident about retirement patterns. (Another factor: Republicans\\u2019 refusal to let Obama replace Antonin Scalia in 2016.) Yet a few liberal justices really do seem to have had a more blas\\u00e9 attitude toward retirement than their conservative colleagues.\", \"Conservative judges seem to view themselves as members of a legal movement, especially since the rise of the Federalist Society in the 1980s. Not since John F. Kennedy\\u2019s presidency has a justice from the right half of the ideological spectrum been replaced by one from the left half.\", \"Liberal justices, on the other hand, have sometimes placed more emphasis on their personal preferences \\u2014 whether they enjoy being on the court or would rather retire \\u2014 than the larger consequences for the country.\", \"In 2013 and 2014, Ginsburg \\u2014 who, like many justices, loved the job \\u2014 rejected pleas to step down, despite being in her 80s and having cancer. After her death in 2020, Donald Trump replaced her with Amy Coney Barrett, who may provide the deciding vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, affirmative action and more.\", \"Even Warren\\u2019s retirement, more than 50 years ago, still shapes the court. He feared being replaced by Nixon and deliberately announced his retirement while Johnson was still president, in 1968. But Warren had waited too long. In the final months of Johnson\\u2019s presidency, Senate conservatives filibustered his nominee, Abe Fortas, and Nixon was then able to replace Warren as chief justice with Warren Burger.\", \"A conservative has held the job of chief justice ever since.\", \"Breyer has made it clear that he does not want to be seen as a liberal justice or a Democratic appointee. He would prefer that people think of him as an impartial judge. The court\\u2019s authority, he said in a speech last year, depends on \\u201ca trust that the court is guided by legal principle, not politics.\\u201d\", \"Other justices have made similar arguments. \\u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts said in 2018. Barrett put it bluntly last year: \\u201cThis court is not comprised of a bunch of partisan hacks.\\u201d\", \"That is a fair description of the justices\\u2019 rulings on many cases. Unanimous verdicts and heterodox coalitions of justices are common, especially in technical cases that receive little attention outside legal circles. Sometimes, it\\u2019s also true on high-profile cases, such as recent ones on Obamacare and L.G.B.T.Q. rights.\", \"But on many of the closely watched cases that shape daily life in the U.S., the justices do split along ideological lines, especially in recent years. On abortion, guns, labor unions, corporate regulation, gerrymandering, campaign finance and voting rights, the best way to predict the justices\\u2019 votes is to know whether a Democratic or Republican president appointed them. The court can often resemble a kind of super-legislature, despite the protestations of Breyer and his colleagues.\", \"For that reason, his retirement is likely to have only a modest effect on major upcoming cases. One Democrat \\u2014 Bill Clinton \\u2014 nominated Breyer, and another Democrat \\u2014 Joe Biden \\u2014 will replace him. Breyer\\u2019s successor may be somewhat more liberal than him, a reflection of the Democratic Party\\u2019s shift since Clinton\\u2019s presidency. But any such difference will matter little in most cases.\", \"The biggest impact of Breyer\\u2019s retirement is the situation that it prevents (assuming, of course, that the Democratic-controlled Senate confirms Biden\\u2019s nominee). His departure means that Breyer has not followed the pattern of Ginsburg, Brennan, Marshall and Warren. Breyer will never be the liberal icon each of them is, but he has managed to uphold liberal ideals \\u2014 the ideals he and they have shared \\u2014 in the closing chapter of his public life.\", \"The transition to a clean energy economy could empower Russia and other petrostates before it diminishes them, Meghan L. O\\u2019Sullivan and Jason Bordoff argue.\", \"The champ: Amy Schneider\\u2019s \\u201cJeopardy!\\u201d run has ended at 40 games.
