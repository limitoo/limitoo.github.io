Wearing a raggedy dress and frumpy sweater, she is treated like a lowly servant by her imperious stepmother and snide stepsisters.\", \"Left alone to ponder her fate, Cinderella sings a wistful aria, music that suggests an old folk song, and allows herself a moment to dream. There must be someone who can rescue her; somewhere a loving soul mate is waiting. Leonard, who has excelled at the Met as Debussy\\u2019s M\\u00e9lisande and in other major roles, does it meltingly.\", \"Cinderella\\u2019s rescuer, unfortunately, is not her father, Pandolfe (the bass-baritone Laurent Naouri). As we learn, Pandolfe was a widower living contentedly in the country with his beloved daughter when he foolishly married the energetic Madame de la Halti\\u00e8re, who already had two children. Soon she revealed herself as overbearing and ambitious. Pandolfe proves incapable of standing up to her and protecting his daughter.\", \"And who could stand up to this production\\u2019s Halti\\u00e8re, the mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe? With her powerful, deep-set voice and take-charge presence, Blythe is hilariously withering.\", \"In the bustling opening scene, she orders her fearful servants and obsequious milliners to create fancy gowns for her daughters to attend a royal ball; the king of the realm (the robust bass-baritone Michael Sumuel, in his Met debut) has decreed that the recalcitrant prince will finally choose a wife. Massenet\\u2019s music teems with rustling flourishes and pomp, vibrantly led by the conductor Emmanuel Villaume. Left behind, poor Cinderella curls up on the floor and falls asleep.\", \"But her longing to attend the ball has been heard by the Fairy Godmother (the bright-voiced coloratura soprano Jessica Pratt), who arrives with spirit-helpers \\u2014 a dancing chorus of women dressed eerily like Cinderella, who wakes up draped in silver-cream and is taken to the palace in a horse-drawn carriage. Is it all a dream?\", \"What comes through in Massenet\\u2019s telling, elegantly rendered in this performance, is that Prince Charming (Emily D\\u2019Angelo, a rich-voiced mezzo) is also a dreamer. We first see him looking miserable in his red pajamas, dreading the ball and his responsibilities.\", \"During a faux-courtly, tartly comic choral scene, a parade of eligible women in outrageous outfits \\u2014 Pelly also designed the costumes \\u2014 appear before the sullen prince, who can barely respond. Then, in a vision, Cinderella arrives. As their silent glances turn into lyrical exchanges, beautifully sung by Leonard and D\\u2019Angelo, these young people truly seem like the answers to one another\\u2019s dreams.\", \"And so the familiar tale unfolds: the glass slipper that falls off Cinderella\\u2019s foot as she rushes away at midnight; the prince\\u2019s relentless search to find its owner; and the joyous outcome when their dream of love becomes reality.\", \"The production is a delight, with lines from Perrault\\u2019s fairy tale written all over Barbara de Limburg\\u2019s set and Laura Scozzi\\u2019s choreography a deft blend of sleek moves and silliness. The cast (including Jacqueline Echols and Maya Lahyani as the stepsisters) could hardly be better. It is an apt companion for the Met\\u2019s other family fare for the holidays: Mozart\\u2019s \\u201cMagic Flute,\\u201d which opened last week.\"]","href_hash":"972df49060e411ecaf0cb594308ae889"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"972df49060e411ecaf0cb594308ae889"}},
