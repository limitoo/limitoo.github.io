A lot of people were happy to see it\\u2014most people.\\\"\", \"Later in the interview, Trump declared: \\\"I helped save Kenosha.\\\"\", \"\\\"As you know, I went there and I sent in a lot of people... because Democrats that run places don't do too well,\\\" he said. \\\"And you had a governor, somebody, he didn't want to call in anybody. He just wanted to let it burn.\\\"\", \"The former president then compared Kenosha to other cities like Minneapolis, Minnesota; Seattle, Washington; and Portland, Oregon. The three cities experienced citizen unrest and property damage during the racial justice protests of summer 2020, sparked by the death of George Floyd in police custody.\", \"\\\"I sent in a lot of people... I didn't wait,\\\" Trump told Ingraham. \\\"If you looked at Minneapolis, that place was burning down, and we really got it stopped.... We saved it and we saved Kenosha. It was really a horrible couple of nights. They got individual stores, the place didn't burn down to the ground because we sent in a lot of good people.\\\"\", \"Rittenhouse came to Kenosha amid several days of unrest, arson and looting following the August 23, 2020 police shooting of Jacob Blake. The shooting left Blake, a Black man, paralyzed from the waist down.\", \"Federal agents arrived in the city on August 28, 2020 and Trump visited the city on September 1, 2020. The state's governor, the city's mayor and the city's NAACP chapter advised against Trump's visiting, saying that it would inflame tensions in the city.\", \"During the Kenosha uprising, citizens destroyed 40 buildings and damaged an additional 100 buildings, WLS-TV reported. The uprising cost an estimated $50 million in damages, according to the Kenosha Area Business Alliance.\", \"During the summer protests, racial justice activists criticized Trump for sending federal agents into cities experiencing uprisings. They alleged that the agents assaulted peaceful protesters and escalated conflicts.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937176/trump-comments-rittenhouse-verdict-kenosha-fox-news.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">When speaking to Fox News, Republican former President Donald Trump congratulated himself on the not guilty verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse shooting case. \\\"We saved Kenosha,\\\" Trump said, referring to his actions against racial justice protesters during his presidency.
