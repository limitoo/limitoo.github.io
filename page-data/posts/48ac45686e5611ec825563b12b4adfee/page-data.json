It has since been exhibited in a museum in the city while its long-term future is considered.\", \"The incident exemplified disagreement on whether such memorials glorified some of the darkest chapters of the nation's past or simply reflected its imperial history.\", \"Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last year the country should not attempt to rewrite the past or \\\"photoshop\\\" its cultural landscape by hauling down monuments to certain historical figures.\\u00a0\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"48ac45686e5611ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"48ac45686e5611ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
