By the time I landed the twitching had stopped, and the doctor who checked it out found nothing wrong.\", \"Back in Moscow, at a chance meeting with the U.S. Embassy doctor, I recounted this incident. Nothing strange there, he said: \\u201cEverybody gets the \\u2018Moscow Eye\\u2019 soon after they arrive and it soon goes away.\\u201d\", \"I took him to mean that it was a nervous reaction to the novel stress of finding oneself in a hostile state, secretly watched and listened to. It was hard on the nerves. Everyone had a story of KGB surveillance, like listening devices falling out of chandeliers or recording equipment spotted behind a closed door. One colleague got freaked out by suspicious flashes of light through the night, until he realized they were sparks from Moscow\\u2019s antiquated trolley buses, which drew power from overhead wires. \\u201cJust because you\\u2019re paranoid doesn\\u2019t mean you\\u2019re wrong,\\u201d was the watchword.\", \"These memories have resurfaced as I\\u2019ve followed the saga of \\u201cHavana syndrome,\\u201d the neurological symptoms that American diplomats and spies, and some Canadians, started reporting in Cuba in 2016 and have reported in several other places since, most recently Colombia. The symptoms are indisputable and serious \\u2014 they\\u2019ve included headaches, nausea, impaired balance and hearing loss. They\\u2019re every bit as real as my twitching eye, and, according to the reports, considerably more debilitating.\", \"So is this another consequence of nerves frayed by the invisible eyes and ears of a secret surveillance apparatus? Or is it caused by some dastardly new weapon deployed by America\\u2019s enemies \\u2014 Russia? \\u2014 to eavesdrop or harass spies and diplomats?\", \"So far, despite many efforts to explain the \\u201canomalous health incidents\\u201d \\u2014 the bureaucratese assigned to the phenomenon by the government, scientists and investigative journalists \\u2014 no one has come up with anything conclusive.\", \"A variety of theories have been proposed, generally along the lines of some form of targeted beams or sonic weapons using microwaves or ultrasound, only to be disproved or deemed inconclusive. Among the most celebrated findings was that recordings of the buzzing noises reported in several of the Havana incidents were actually the mating call of a particularly loud cricket, Anurogryllus celerinictus.\", \"Another possibility raised is an outbreak of what used to be called mass hysteria but now goes by less offensive-sounding names like mass psychogenic illness, conversion disorder and functional neurological disorders. The basic idea is that a reaction to some form of stress or trauma can cause a variety of symptoms that cannot be explained by any other disease or condition. Once they appear in one person, moreover, they can spread in a group sharing the same conditions \\u2014 say, among officials in a hostile setting.\", \"Psychosomatic reactions can be very real and just as debilitating as an illness with a traditional medical explanation. There is nothing shameful about it. Though my eye stopped twitching after that initial episode, I never became accustomed in my years in the Soviet Union to being tailed or assuming that everything I said was being recorded somewhere. I\\u2019d know it was time to take a break when I would start doing foolish things like trying to lose the tan Zhiguli (the old Soviet sedan) with the MW3692 plate number through reckless maneuvers. And I remember the tension lifting as my flight took off from Sheremetyevo Airport.\", \"The 200 or so U.S. officials who have reported neurological symptoms do deserve every effort by the government to get to the bottom of their problem. The trouble is that Havana syndrome has become so deeply enmeshed in the contentious politics of our time that agreement on an objective cause may prove all but impossible.\", \"Despite the absence of any conclusive evidence about what causes it, or any reason it would appear in locations as diverse as India, Colombia, Vietnam, Austria, China, Serbia and Russia, or even a concrete number of officials afflicted, powerful lobbies have concluded that the symptoms are the work of a hostile power, and that this points to Russia. (For the record, Russia and Cuba both deny any role.)\", \"A top State Department official brought back from retirement to coordinate a response to the illness was released after only six months, presumably in part because she would not rule out a mass psychogenic illness. The C.I.A. station chief in Vienna, a hotbed of espionage, was removed in September, purportedly because he did not take the incidents seriously enough.\", \"Marc Polymeropoulos, a former C.I.A. officer who says he was hit by Havana syndrome in Moscow in 2017, wrote on Twitter that failing to rule out \\u201cmass hysteria\\u201d as a cause was \\u201cinsulting to victims and automatically disqualifying\\u201d for someone to lead the investigation.\", \"In September, Congress unanimously passed the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks (HAVANA) Act, which will provide financial support to sufferers of the neurological symptoms. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who is a son of Cuban exiles and was one of the authors of the bill, dismissed some of those skeptical of the theory that the symptoms were caused by directed-energy attacks as \\u201cinfluence agents\\u201d who were paid or encouraged by \\u201cforeign government or whatever, that don\\u2019t want this to be discussed out there and want to cast doubt about it.\\u201d\", \"The skeptics, however, include many serious scientists, such as Cheryl Royfer, a former chemist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, who wrote in Foreign Policy that no proponent of the directed-energy theory has outlined how such a weapon would work and that any nation has developed one. \\u201cExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,\\u201d she wrote, \\u201cand no evidence has been offered to support the existence of this mystery weapon.\\u201d\", \"That does not mean there is no mystery weapon. In fact, thinking back on the Moscow Eye, I realize I never wondered whether it might have been caused by some KGB beam bouncing around my office. But the potential ramifications of such a conclusion for Havana syndrome \\u2014 and the indisputable neurological symptoms of the Americans who have suffered from it for several years now \\u2014 demand dispassionate and objective investigation, not speculative bombast.\"]","href_hash":"69d7ca063c8711ecbccc000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"69d7ca063c8711ecbccc000017025a03"}},
