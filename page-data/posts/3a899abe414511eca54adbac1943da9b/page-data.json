She\\u2019s just read \\u201cJane Eyre,\\u201d and, like Bront\\u00eb\\u2019s heroine, she\\u2019s ensconced in a big house with turrets and falls for its broodingly handsome male occupant.\", \"\\u201cYou cannot know these blistering feelings,\\u201d Carol writes in a tumescent letter to a friend, \\u201c\\u2014 you have not met your Rochester. But believe me, they are so powerful that now every novel, every line of poetry, makes perfect and vivid sense.\\u201d She longs to \\u201cravish\\u201d him, though she isn\\u2019t entirely clear what that means; surely it \\u201ccouldn\\u2019t be anything so boring as sex.\\u201d\", \"The pursuit of desire \\u2014 the hubris and folly of it, its links to our intellect and the tricky synchronicity of brain and heart \\u2014 is King\\u2019s best subject. She\\u2019s the author of five acclaimed novels, but it\\u2019s her last two \\u2014 \\u201cWriters & Lovers,\\u201d in which an aspiring novelist grieves her mother\\u2019s unexpected death while finishing her book and navigating a love triangle, and \\u201cEuphoria,\\u201d which was loosely inspired by experiences in the life of the anthropologist Margaret Mead \\u2014 that have assured her place in contemporary literature. This is, in part, because King reminds us of the revelations still to be found in plot and character, those elements of fiction that might be called old-fashioned if it weren\\u2019t for the fact that she, with her range and emotional precision, never makes them feel so. There is, it turns out, still much more to know about what living is all about, and the things that crack us open, geode-like, to reveal some hidden marvel within.\", \"In King\\u2019s novels, ideas are often the best conveyance for passion: In \\u201cEuphoria,\\u201d set in 1930s Papua New Guinea, the titular emotion refers to a breakthrough in comprehension, that sense of thrilling clarity in which understanding another culture seems within grasp. (One of the more erotic moments in the book is a scene in which three anthropologists create \\u201cthe Grid,\\u201d excitedly mapping human civilization along an axis.) But as Nell Stone, the Mead stand-in, acknowledges, the feeling might also be rooted in a kind of delusion. We are profoundly limited by our subjectivity, she explains to the British anthropologist with whom she has fallen in love, and yet our perspective \\u201ccan have an enormous wingspan.\\u201d So too the impossibility of fully comprehending our marriages, attractions and intimacies. We cannot stand outside ourselves to objectively see ourselves in relation to the people we love, but that doesn\\u2019t mean that we stop trying.\", \"As in her novels, many of the stories in King\\u2019s first collection of short fiction, \\u201cFive Tuesdays in Winter,\\u201d are preceded by loss and ignited by desire \\u2014 the pursuit of which often hinges upon its articulation, the ability to find the \\u201cwords for all that roiled inside you,\\u201d as the protagonist of the title story, a reticent used-book seller, puts it. He\\u2019s surrounded by evidence of the power of language in the form of the tattered classics that fill his shop, but after the departure of his wife, he struggles to express his affection for his daughter, not to mention his growing passion for his shop assistant. King supplies the words for him with the kind of interior monologue we can relate to: After a date with the wrong woman, he feels \\u201cabstracted and disjointed, and it occurred to him that the sensation was only a slight magnification of the feeling he felt all the time.\\u201d\", \"Parents in King\\u2019s early fiction were often both larger than life and unavailable \\u2014 alcoholic, narcissistic or otherwise absent. It\\u2019s a theme in these stories, too, though the standouts tend to paint generational impasses with a finer, softer brush. The moment of connection between the bookseller and his daughter, when it comes, is fittingly awkward and tender, and one that neither will forget.\", \"In \\u201cThe North Sea,\\u201d a German woman, abruptly widowed and left in financial straits, takes her teenage daughter on a seaside holiday, hoping to break through the grief that has silenced them. \\u201cAdults hid their pain, their fears, their failure,\\u201d the widow reflects, after treating her daughter to a horseback riding lesson she can\\u2019t afford, \\u201cbut adolescents hid their happiness, as if to reveal it would risk its loss.\\u201d The ending, in which the daughter babysits for an irritatingly happy Australian family staying at the same inn, is as twisted as it is gratifying.\", \"It says a lot about King\\u2019s dexterity with tone that a father\\u2019s breakdown and suicide attempt is the background to the collection\\u2019s most amusing story, \\u201cWhen in the Dordogne,\\u201d in which an adolescent is left in the care of a pair of boisterous college boys who teach him, in essence, how to enjoy life \\u2014 and how to talk to the girl on whom he has a crush.\", \"King\\u2019s acuity with all that roils inside us often puts me in the mind of Tessa Hadley or Joan Silber, authors who shun ironic distance for forthright proximity, whose feminism is implicit, who could inscribe the contents of the human heart on the head of a pin. In the final story, \\u201cThe Man at the Door,\\u201d a writer\\u2019s doubts in her own talents following the birth of her son come knocking in the form of a man who demands a gin martini and proceeds to shred her confidence. \\u201cI have never understood why a person who is not a genius bothers with art,\\u201d he tells her.\", \"It\\u2019s the kind of ripped-from-life-sounding line that recalls the beginning of \\u201cWriters & Lovers,\\u201d in which the narrator\\u2019s yuppie landlord patronizingly asks the narrator how her novel is coming along. \\u201cYou know,\\u201d he says, \\u201cI just find it extraordinary that you think you have something to say.\\u201d Back at her desk, she thinks: \\u201cI don\\u2019t write because I think I have something to say. I write because if I don\\u2019t, everything feels even worse.\\u201d For certain kinds of writers (I am one), there\\u2019s companionship to be found in those words.\", \"King has written that she based that scene on a similar experience she had while she was working on her first novel, and it\\u2019s clear from these stories that she\\u2019s never lost sight of how difficult it is to take oneself seriously when no one else really does. It\\u2019s one of the reasons I think of her as \\u201ca writer\\u2019s writer\\u201d \\u2014 in the best sense, in the sense that we never doubt her belief in storytelling as our best chance at truth and its solaces. She isn\\u2019t afraid of acknowledging the way in which a lack of money might forestall our dreams. She knows that what we call coming-of-age doesn\\u2019t happen in a single electric moment at age 14, but that part of being human is to keep discovering, in our seasons of euphoria and sorrow, new corners of being. In our time of anxiety and isolation, King writes stories to curl up in, by which I mean they afford us something rarely celebrated in literature: comfort.\"]","href_hash":"3a899abe414511eca54adbac1943da9b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3a899abe414511eca54adbac1943da9b"}},
