But his displays with both the gloves and bat - scoring an unbeaten 57 in New Zealand's first innings - will appease his critics moving forward into the Blackcaps' two-test series against South Africa starting next month.\", \"Batting at No.3, Najmul Hossain Shanto became entangled in a battle with Neil Wagner, as the Blackcaps seamer employed his trademark short-pitched game plan against the left-hander.\", \"For the most part, Shanto had success against Wagner, racing to 29 from 35 balls - with 26 of those runs coming in boundaries. But as he so often does, Wagner had the last laugh, removing Shanto with a bouncer hooked straight to the hands of Trent Boult before lunch.\", \"Naim (24) and captain Mominul Haque (37) frustrated the Blackcaps after the break, before a stunning catch from Tom Latham broke Bangladesh's third-wicket stand.\\u00a0\", \"After Latham took third slip out, the captain flung himself to his left from second slip and reeled in a one-handed catch that ended Naim's vigil for a 98-ball 24 to give Southee his first wicket.\", \"Wagner then took the prized wicket of Bangladesh skipper Mominul, as a regulation edge flew through to Ross Taylor at first-slip.\\u00a0\", \"The strike saw Wagner move to 234 test wickets for the Blackcaps to overtake Chris Martin into fifth among the Blackcaps' all-time leading wicket-takers.\", \"Wagner had his third wicket before tea by bouncing out Yasir Ali for two, caught by Latham to have Bangladesh 128/5 - still 267 runs from forcing the Blackcaps to bat again.\", \"And as Bangladesh reached tea at 152/5, the Blackcaps had two hours of the final session to try and win inside three days.\", \"As the Blackcaps chased the last five wickets before stumps, Bangladesh went on the counter-attack, as the pair of Litton Das and Nurul Hasan (36) added a century stand for the sixth wicket.\", \"Reaching their 50-run stand in 67 balls, it took Das and Nurul only 30 more deliveries to take their partnership to triple figures.\", \"Das kept the scoreboard ticking over to reach his half-century in 69 balls, with Nurul hanging around at the other end.\", \"An inspired bowling change from Latham saw the Blackcaps break the partnership, as Daryl Mitchell picked up his second test wicket, having Nurul caught by Wagner running around from mid-off.\", \"Mehidy Hasan Miraz came and went for three, before he too fell to a Latham catch, this time off the bowling of Jamieson.\", \"Running out of partners, Das reached triple figures, bringing up his second test century from 106 balls, with his second 50 runs coming in just 37 deliveries.\", \"But Das' stay at the crease came to an end just two runs after reaching his century, as Jamieson trapped him lbw for his third wicket, and then had a fourth when Shoriful Islam was caught by Southee at mid-off, caught for a duck.\", \"And with the new ball just one over away, Latham gave Taylor the chance for the perfect farewell to test cricket.\", \"Taylor bows out of test cricket with a New Zealand record 7683 runs at an average of 44.66, including 19 centuries and a best of 290.\", \"What's more, he'll finish with a bowling average of 16, taking three wickets from his 112 tests, finishing his red ball career with his final scalp.\", \"Taylor will finish his international career later this summer, signing off with ODI series against Australia and the Netherlands.\", \"NZ 521/6 declared (Latham 252, Conway 109; Shoriful 2/79, Ebadot 2/143)\", \"Bangladesh 126 (Yasir 55; Boult 5/43, Southee 3/28) & 278 (Das 102; Jamieson 4/82, Wagner 3/77)\"]","href_hash":"95bdfb4072a111ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"95bdfb4072a111ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
