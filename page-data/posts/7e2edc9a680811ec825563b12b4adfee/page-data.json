I just think that England have lost their way. The performance today summed it up.\", \"\\\"It's been a walk in the park for the Australians. It burns me to say that but they have completely outplayed England.\\\"\", \"Michael Vaughan, another former skipper, said England had not focused on test cricket enough.\", \"\\\"They're a group of players that pride themselves on competing and they've just not managed to find any kind of consistency or skill,\\\" Vaughan told Fox Cricket.\", \"\\\"It's not been easy in these times: the England side haven't had a great deal of preparation. But if you want to look for excuses you can, you can always find excuses - this test match team for quite a while has not been good enough.\", \"\\\"The focus has been on the white ball team and it delivered a World Cup, but we're not a good enough cricketing nation to take our eye off the ball of test match cricket.\\\"\", \"Moeen Ali, who retired from test cricket in September, said there was a massive gulf in class between Australia and England.\", \"\\\"Australia are just way ahead of England,\\\" Ali told BT Sport. \\\"I didn't think the gap was that big before the series but I almost think it is bigger than we are willing to admit.

I don't mind him living in cuckoo land but stop trying to kid us,\\\" Boycott wrote in his column in The Telegraph.\", \"\\\"It's every cricketer's dream to captain England and Joe has had 59 test matches to mould and stamp his authority on this set of players.
