But the Omicron variant's emergence has brought uncertainty to the future of gas prices and supply nearly two years into a pandemic that has rocked the industry.\", \"Countries have already enacted strict travel restrictions since the new strain was designated as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week. If the variant triggers lockdowns, oil demand could be cut by nearly 3 million barrels per day in the early part of 2022, according to projections by Rystad Energy.\", \"Frustrated by OPEC's gradual supply increase plan and growing outcry about rising gas prices, President Joe Biden announced last week that that the U.S. and other nations would tap into their strategic oil reserves and release tens of millions of oil barrels in the hopes of upping supply and curbing price increases.\", \"Despite OPEC's decision and the possible connotations of the Omicron variant, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that there were currently no plans to delay the strategic reserve releases.\", \"\\\"We welcome the decision today to continue the 400,000 barrels-per-day increase,\\\" Psaki said. \\\"We believe this should help facilitate the global economic recovery.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944323/gas-prices-unlikely-lower.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">OPEC and allied oil-producing countries meet Thursday, Dec. 2, 2021 with uncertainty over the Omicron variant's future impact on the global economic recovery hanging over their decision on how much oil to pump to a world that is paying more for gasoline. Above, gasoline prices are displayed at a station in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., Wednesday, Nov. 17, 2021.</div>\", \"Positive news about drugs to treat the variant or the vaccines' effectiveness against it could improve the outlook on oil demand cuts. But even with positive news, a decrease in oil demand is likely because \\\"the distribution of these remedies may not actually reach all markets with extreme immediacy, which would still necessitate the lockdowns in much of the developing world,\\\" said Louise Dickson, senior oil markets analyst for Rystad.\", \"The price of a barrel of U.S. benchmark crude fell with news of the variant and then fell further as OPEC+ revealed it wasn't going to curtail production. It was about $78 a barrel a week ago and was trading at about $66 a barrel Thursday. International benchmark Brent crude followed a similar path, falling from $79 a barrel a week ago to about $69 on Thursday.\", \"The decision by OPEC+ to stay the course sends a signal that \\\"the group does what it says and that they will continue their policy on their own terms,\\\" Dickson said. \\\"It also really signals that OPEC+ needs a bit more time to really dig into the numbers on the Omicron variant.\\\"\", \"Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman earlier this week played down any impact the little-understood variant would have on oil demand, telling the kingdom's Asharq al-Awsat newspaper: \\\"We are not worried.\\\"\", \"But OPEC ministers briefly postponed one of their meetings this week, hoping for more insight into whether the variant is likely to push the world back toward pandemic lockdowns or leave markets relatively unscathed.\", \"Some analysts had predicted that the OPEC+ alliance\\u2014made up of OPEC members and allied non-members like Russia\\u2014would act cautiously Thursday, pending more clarity from medical experts on the new variant.\", \"Before Omicron's appearance, the OPEC+ meeting had been shaping up as a potentially fraught moment in a growing dispute between oil-supplying nations and oil-consuming ones, as the global economy rebounds from the worst of the pandemic downturn and demand for oil surged.\", \"Angering the U.S. and its allies, OPEC+ has stuck to a plan to open the petroleum taps bit by bit\\u2014even as oil prices surged to seven-year highs\\u2014until deep production cuts made during the depths of the pandemic are restored.\", \"Biden sent senior energy adviser Amos Hochstein to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia this week to soothe relations, address energy prices and talk about working together in transitioning to cleaner energy.
