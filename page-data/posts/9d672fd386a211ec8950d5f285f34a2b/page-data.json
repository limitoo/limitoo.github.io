Tish Harrison Warren (Opinion, Jan. 24):\", \"I totally agree with Ms. Warren that societal changes are needed to support pregnant women and girls so that their decisions whether to bring a child into the world versus abort aren\\u2019t dominated by lack of money, day care, decent housing or adequate insurance.\", \"But I am confused about what exactly she is proposing: Does she want to make abortions harder or impossible to obtain? Does she believe that this would propel society to change in the positive ways that she has outlined? And where does birth control fit into this picture?\", \"Personally, I believe that an abortion is always a tragedy on some level. Lowering the number of abortions is always desirable. However, I believe that every girl and woman has her own beliefs, and should not be forced to carry a pregnancy to birth.\", \"Making abortions hard to get will mostly affect poor women, while the societal changes that would help these women to raise their children will not be coming anytime soon. Meanwhile, making sure that birth control is easily available and inexpensive or free is a no-brainer.\", \"Laurel BenderBoulder, Colo.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"The essay by Tish Harrison Warren on the difficult abortion issue was the most insightful and heartfelt discussion of abortion ever. The fact that she has counseled women in crisis and experienced a difficult pregnancy diagnosis adds to her credibility. She reminds all of us, whether leaning left or right, of our need to respect life and of the sometimes arduous duties that entails.\", \"During my 40-year career in pediatrics, I was inspired by the courage and grace of parents caring for their special needs children with Down syndrome and other conditions who could have been aborted. Those children and their parents facing these difficult choices deserve our love and support.\", \"Allan LaReauKalamazoo, Mich.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"My story is probably not atypical, and 50 years later I have no regrets about having had an abortion. I was 22 years old, living 2,000 miles from my family, a victim of date rape, no serious boyfriend, no serious career, ashamed of the date rape but not of an abortion.\", \"I had fears for a child born under those circumstances. My religious beliefs did not recognize a fetus as an independent life. I respect those who believe differently from me, but I demand that in turn they respect my religious beliefs.\", \"An abortion was not a difficult decision for me. The alternatives were horrifying. Now it is the loss of the right to an abortion that is horrifying.\", \"Susan OlneySan Francisco\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Tish Harrison Warren took lonely trips to the recycling plant in Texas in the early \\u201980s, choosing to separate her trash when it was time-intensive and difficult. Now she has curbside recycling every Wednesday. And so it should be with pregnancies, she argues. Make the choice to carry a child to term an easy one: Celebrate pregnant women, provide maternity leave, prenatal care, a road to success for young women with children, etc.\", \"Yes to all of that! But remember: Nobody took away her regular trash can in Texas in the early \\u201980s. Nobody forced her to recycle when there was no infrastructure to do so. They eventually gave us recycling bins, and now we have a choice.\", \"Kirsten HarjesDavis, Calif.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Tish Harrison Warren articulates a beautifully written argument opposing abortion on demand in a society that does not ease the choice to continue a pregnancy. I found myself deeply respecting her view. She does not, however, articulate a fundamental philosophical and moral disagreement that underlies the abortion debate.\", \"That is the question about when an undifferentiated ball of cells in a woman\\u2019s uterus becomes something more than an undifferentiated ball of cells. It would be nice if one could draw a clear line at conception, as many do, but in my view that is not the case. For me, we become human gradually step by step. So any line is difficult and arbitrary, but such is the problem of choice in a moral world.\", \"So thus far we have decided as a society to respect individual choice about where to draw that line. It\\u2019s a position that I earnestly support in the face of a moral question that has no clear answer.\", \"Stephen KarakashianMilwaukie, Ore.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"My mother was raised without a mother. My grandmother, after having four children, did not want a fifth. They were Italian immigrants, poor, and could hardly support the four children they did have. Because of this, my grandmother had an abortion. And because abortions were illegal at the time, she went to a back alley abortionist.\", \"She developed an infection but would not go to a hospital because she was afraid she would be arrested, and she died. As a lapsed Catholic, I think abortion is horrible. But I will defend any woman\\u2019s decision to have one.\", \"Barbara VogellNesconset, N.Y.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cWhen Abortions Were Illegal\\u201d (Sunday Review, Jan. 23):\", \"I was 18 in 1969 when I wound up in the back seat of an old Cadillac riding down a dirt road in Birmingham, Ala., where I had come to have an abortion. The doctor declined after examining me. Too far along, he said. But he knew someone else.\", \"The three-room wood shack had three barking dogs, urine on the floor, and a room with a bare light bulb hanging over a sheet of plywood over two sawhorses. There was a medical diagram on the wall. I climbed up, and the wild-haired old redhead inserted a tube through my cervix and stuffed cotton batting in my vagina to hold it in place.\", \"About 36 hours later, with a fever and after hemorrhaging, friends dropped me off outside the hospital. But they wouldn\\u2019t admit me without parental permission! I phoned an older woman friend and asked her to pose as my mother and agree to surgery. Police surrounded me. Who did this to you? I did this to myself. Who did this to you? I did this to myself.\", \"A dilation and curettage was performed. I was lucky. I lived. But I almost died. And there will always be disadvantaged, uninformed, scared, alone young women and girls who will suffer without available health care.\", \"Angela FremontNew York\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Thank you for sharing these stories of women\\u2019s pain and bravery in seeking and receiving abortions before Roe v. Wade, and the lives they went on to lead. But I wonder, what would the women have said when asked about the children they might have had, and the lives they could have led? These stories are important, too \\u2014 and left out all too often.\", \"Mitchell GoinsChicago\", \"To the Editor:\", \"In \\u201cThe Case Against Abortion\\u201d (column, Dec. 2) Ross Douthat wrote about the \\u201cslippery slope\\u201d of declaring that fetuses are not persons. But another slippery slope has already happened: A pregnant woman was shot in the belly, killing her unborn child, and she was arrested because she started the fight. That is where logic gets us.\", \"A fetus is a human life; that\\u2019s logical. But if a just society is based on logic, a humane society is based on compassion. Overturning Roe means putting people in jail, for all manner of miscarriages and instances where a woman didn\\u2019t prevent harm to her unborn child.\", \"Erika Bachiochi (\\u201cI Refused to Vote for Trump, but I\\u2019m Grateful for His Court Picks,\\u201d Opinion guest essay, Dec. 9) and Tish Harrison Warren are full of ideas I agree with. But the society they seek should not depend on throwing people into jail.\", \"Maybe we\\u2019re finally realizing there\\u2019s a false choice: pitting the \\u201clogic\\u201d of being pro-life against a \\u201cright\\u201d that is often the only choice. The answer lies in neither worshiping logic nor creating a competition between rights. The answer is compassion.\", \"The current threat to legal abortion is leading to conversations we should have had all along. I hope it leads to common ground.\", \"Amy CriderChicago\"]","href_hash":"9d672fd386a211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9d672fd386a211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
