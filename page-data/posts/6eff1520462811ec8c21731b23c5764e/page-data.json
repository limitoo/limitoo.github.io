This isn't the first time we've spotted one of these relatively diminutive black holes, but astronomers usually find them because of the X-rays emitted from around them as they swallow matter, or from the gravitational waves they emit when they collide with a neutron star or another black hole.\", \"Black holes are difficult to spot because they trap light behind a point called the event horizon. If they aren't consuming material and causing the emission of electromagnetic radiation in this way, black holes are pretty much invisible.\", \"The problem with these methods is many stellar-mass black holes don't give away these tell-tale signals. That means that astronomers have to find more ingenious ways of spotting them.\", \"The team instead used a dynamical model that considers instead the influence black holes have on stars that orbit them and the role they have played in developing the systems they are a part of.\", \"\\\"The vast majority can only be unveiled dynamically,\\\" team member and researcher from the University of G\\u00f6ttingen, Germany, Stefan Dreizler, said. \\\"When they form a system with a star, they will affect its motion in a subtle but detectable way, so we can find them with sophisticated instruments.\\\"\", \"The successful detection of the black hole in NGC 1850, home to thousands of stars, marks the first time a black hole has been found in a young star cluster.\", \"The cluster in the Large Magellanic Cloud is just 100 million years old, barely an infant in cosmic terms, and finding a black hole in such a young collection of stars could help reveal how such systems evolve and grow.\", \"Researchers can now compare this black hole to more mature examples and attempt to trace how they swallow matter, including stars and planets, and merge with other black holes to achieve truly massive sizes.\", \"A better understanding of stellar-mass black holes and the processes that they are involved in could also help us understand gravitational wave sources in distant galaxies better.\", \"In our own galaxy, the Milky Way, researchers believe a hidden population of stellar-mass black holes exists, albeit effectively hidden. As many as 20,0000 of these stellar remnants are expected to dwell around the center of the Milky Way near its central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*. But until now researchers have had difficulty uncovering them.\", \"This new method could play an important role in that search. \", \"\\\"The result shown here represents just one of the wanted criminals, but when you have found one, you are well on your way to discovering many others, in different clusters,\\\" Saracino concluded.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932256/hidden-black-hole.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">An illustration of a compact black hole orbiting a stars in the NGC 1850 star cluster 160,000 light-years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
