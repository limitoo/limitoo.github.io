The debt ceiling is a limit Congress imposes on the federal government's debt.\", \"In a statement on Sunday, Trump said: \\\"Mitch McConnell is giving the Democrats victory on everything. What is wrong with this Broken Old Crow? He's hurting Republican Senators and the Republican Party. When will they vote him out of Leadership?\", \"\\\"He didn't have the guts to play the Debt Ceiling card, which would have given the Republicans a complete victory on virtually everything. The Dems were ready to fold! Watch, they will use Debt Ceiling against us at their first opportunity, and they won't fold. It will not be pretty. GET RID OF MITCH!\\\"\", \"Since Trump stepped down as president, McConnell has avoided talking much about Trump in public interviews.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) also criticized McConnell for adopting the bipartisan deal that allowed the Democrats to raise the debt ceiling.\", \"\\\"What I'm worried about is that for four months the Republican Senate said we would not lift a finger to help the Democrats raise the debt ceiling. We would make them use reconciliation,\\\" Graham told Fox News on Sunday.\", \"\\\"At the end, we did not make them use reconciliation, which changed the rules of the Senate in a House bill.
