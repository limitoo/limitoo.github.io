Of course, there's still some hesitancy around that, for a variety of reasons. But I want to say for the record I am happy to return to the workplace \\u2026 as long as I can bring my bed.\", \"Let me explain. \", \"Like a lot of privileged Americans who had the option of working from home, I started the pandemic embracing the dream of the standing desk. I got one, and knew with absolute certainty that I'd emerge post-COVID a better, stronger Luke Burbank. \", \"By day, I'd stand at my workstation, dazzling my remote colleagues with my discipline and efficiency; by night, I'd ride my exercise bike to nowhere, impressing a whole different group of people with my cool Peloton name, \\\"Spin Diesel.\\\"\", \" So, yeah, that was the dream.

I went into COVID one of those people who made fun of the term \\\"self-care,\\\" and I'm coming out of it as a true believer. If we don't take care of ourselves, it's pretty hard to take care of the people who need us.
