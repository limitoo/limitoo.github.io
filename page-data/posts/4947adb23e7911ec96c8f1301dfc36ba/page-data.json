They would later tell police that they suspected Mr. Arbery of neighborhood break-ins.\", \"In the video, Mr. Arbery dashes around their truck and disappears from view. Then there is muffled shouting, followed by Mr. Arbery reappearing in the frame. He and Travis McMichael scuffle over Travis\\u2019s shotgun. Then, the sound of the weapon firing pierces the air. A second shot is heard as the two are out of view. Next comes the third and final blast. Mr. Arbery staggers a few steps forward then falls into the street.\", \"The video, taken by William \\u201cRoddie\\u201d Bryan, a third man who joined the McMichaels in the chase, became public on May 5, 2020, the same day that officials announced the case would be presented to a grand jury. Two days later, the Georgia Bureau of Investigations secured arrest warrants for the McMichaels.\", \"The video, which captures a large part of the fatal encounter, helped shape the broad \\u2014 and divergent \\u2014 understanding of what happened that Sunday afternoon in the Satilla Shores neighborhood. Lawyers on both sides say the clip bolsters their opposing claims of self-defense, and it played a part in the opening arguments of the murder trial of the two McMichaels and Mr. Bryan. \", \"After the explosive footage emerged, it went viral, driving national and international interest and becoming part of a collection of videos that have served as critical evidence in police or vigilante violence against African Americans \\u2014 and that often have challenged the official narrative.\", \"Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, an online racial justice organization, said when the public sees such incidents with their own eyes, it helps to form their \\u201cunderstanding of real-world harms\\u201d and to strengthen the demands of civil rights movements.\", \"One of the first examples of violence that was captured on video and seen widely was in the case of Rodney King, a motorist who was beaten by four Los Angeles police officers after a high-speed chase in 1991. A man used a Sony video camera to record the beating from his nearby apartment balcony. The video showed officers striking Mr. King with batons more than 50 times and forced a national conversation about race and police brutality.\", \"In 2015, cellphone video taken by a bystander led to murder charges being filed against a North Charleston, S.C., police officer for shooting Walter Scott in the back as he fled from what had started as a traffic stop over a broken taillight.\", \"Five years later, on May 25, 2020, a teenager filmed the murder of George Floyd in the street as a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground with his knee.\", \"The graphic documentation of Mr. Floyd\\u2019s and Mr. Arbery\\u2019s deaths, along with the killing of Breonna Taylor (hers was not recorded with a cellphone), led to demonstrations across the country over racial injustice and policing.\"]","href_hash":"4947adb23e7911ec96c8f1301dfc36ba"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4947adb23e7911ec96c8f1301dfc36ba"}},
