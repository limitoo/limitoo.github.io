For the last five years, the Miles Franklin Award \\u2014 Australia's most prestigious literary prize \\u2014 has gone to a woman. Two of the past three winners have been Indigenous women, Tara June Winch (2020) and Melissa Lucashenko (2019).\", \"Lucashenko won the prize for her searingly honest and funny novel, Too Much Lip.

As evidence, she references Honeybee by Craig Silvey, describing it as a \\\"really nurturing book full of humanity\\\".\", \"This may come as a surprise, given the passage of the book read aloud in the series. It describes the main character, a gender-diverse person called Sam, contemplating their suicide.\", \"Minutes earlier, the audience learns this scene was based on a real event. While on his way to the airport, Silvey's brother and sister-in-law noticed a young person on a highway overpass \\\"standing on the wrong side of the rails\\\". They eventually volunteered that they had been struggling with their gender identity and had been kicked out of home.\", \"When Karvan reads the passage, she is moved to tears. \\\"I think there's enough light, and courage, and love to get us through,\\\" she says, \\\"but there's quite a lot of bleak stuff as well.\\\"\", \"Asked to choose, Karvan struggles to pick just one of the books from the series that has stayed with her after she read it \\u2014 \\\"every book had moments where they sort of grabbed you by the throat\\\" \\u2014 but eventually settles on a line from Tasmanian author Richard Flanagan's first book, Death of a River Guide.\", \"Like Honeybee, Flanagan's book borrows from real life. The now-famous author was travelling down Tasmania's Franklin River when his kayak became wedged between rocks and water was gushing over him. With only a tiny gap to breathe through, he was trapped there for hours.\", \"The line is: \\\"Death is not a complex matter, life is.\\\"\", \"Books That Made Us airs on ABC on Tuesdays at 8.30pm.
