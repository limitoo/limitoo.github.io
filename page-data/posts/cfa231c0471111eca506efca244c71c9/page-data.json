The company took over the ground-floor space and has turned it into a caviar bar and lounge, with 14 comfortable seats at a white marble counter and another 28 in a richly upholstered area with low tables, all lit by hanging circular fixtures. There\\u2019s a small retail area in the front of the space. This new Bar at Caviar Russe, which will open at noon daily, offers small bite alternatives to the executive chef Edgar Panchernikov\\u2019s $150 tasting and \\u00e0 la carte menus upstairs. (The original restaurant was awarded a Michelin star.) In addition to various caviar services with all the proper accouterments and utensils, the downstairs dining options, with cocktails, vodkas, Champagnes and wines, feature raw bar specialties, a raw fish chirashi bowl with caviar, mini-lobster rolls, bao buns with eel and foie gras, and a take on tarte flamb\\u00e9e, topped, like almost everything else, with glistening sturgeon roe. All of the company\\u2019s caviars are farm-raised in northern Germany from stock that originally came from the Caspian Sea, except for the transmontanus white sturgeon, native to California. (Opens Wednesday) \", \"A major dining addition to the Manhattan West development is this ambassador of the Eastern Mediterranean, with vibrant food inspired by Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Israel, Jordan and elsewhere. Designed by AvroKo with intricate wood and tile work, and a big open kitchen with a wood-fired grill, it seats 75 indoors and at least 60 more outside on the plaza. The executive chef, Madeline Sperling, who is from North Carolina and worked at Gramercy Tavern and NoMad, is preparing assorted breads, like honey butter kubaneh, dips, salads, manti dumplings, a lobster tagine and mushroom kibbe. Also on the menu are family-style preparations like black sea bass swathed in grape leaves, and duck borek layered with pastry. Desserts include charred pineapple with rum syrup and lime. Cooking at her side is Juliana Latif, whose roots are Jordanian and Lebanese. The restaurant is under the umbrella of Quality Branded and in partnership with Pendry Manhattan West, which is adjacent to the restaurant. (Wednesday)\", \"Pastificio G. Di Martino, founded in Gragnano, in Campania, Italy, in 1912, is known for dry pasta made with traditional bronze dies. It\\u2019s still going strong, run by Giuseppe Di Martino, an enthusiastic third-generation member of the family. The company is now putting down roots in Chelsea Market. A casual area called A Tavola, where pastas and other dishes are served, opens this week, as do a cocktail bar and a retail store, selling scores of pastas and other products. A to-go counter with special packaging designed to keep the food hot is also on target for this week. On Dec. 9, a huge oval bar, with 30 seats and four chefs preparing pasta to order on a tasting menu, will open.

At Al Badawi, he has a partner, Akram Nassir, the owner of Yemen Caf\\u00e9 nearby. Mr. Elenani has a farm in New Jersey, where he raises produce and livestock for the meats he sends to a halal butcher for his restaurants. He plans another location of Ayat adjacent to Industry City, and a third in Montclair, N.J. \", \"Here\\u2019s another restaurant from a luxury automobile company, something like Intersect by Lexus nearby.

Genesis House, will be overseen by Cho Eun-hee and Park Sungbae, chefs from the prominent Seoul restaurant Onjium, and will emphasize traditional Korean flavors and techniques, notably fermentation, with a special focus on food of the royal families.

Her plate of jerk chicken, collards and mac and cheese is available on weekends for now. But soon, when the kitchen renovations are complete, more of her food will be served, added to the menu of pizzas, soups, sausage sandwiches and panini, along with other new dishes.

Mr. Afzelius is also the executive chef and an owner of Tsismis, a Filipino spot on the Lower East Side.\", \"This ground-floor store for grab-and-go items from breakfast through dinner is in the newly redone Penn 1. The building was formerly Penn Plaza, built in 1972 and once before renovated, in 1995. The public spaces are now brighter and airier, and bleacher-style seating is available in the lobby. Local produce from a cooperative of farms goes into soups, salads, sandwiches, poke bowls and breakfast items, all overseen by the executive chef Brian Huston, with baked goods from sources like Balthazar.
