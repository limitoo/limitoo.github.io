When economists bicker with epidemiologists about the best policy responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, policymakers get confused, and the public suffers. So it\\u2019s good that there\\u2019s a new effort to reconcile them. It takes the form of a manifesto released by 11 scholars this month: a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper with the subtitle \\u201cBringing Epidemiologists and Economists Together.\\u201d\", \"The conventional wisdom is that when it comes to policy prescriptions, economists put more weight on keeping the economy from shutting down, while epidemiologists put more weight on saving lives. That\\u2019s an oversimplification, of course, but there\\u2019s some truth in it. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an article of faith for economists that there is no such thing as an absolute value \\u2014 not even the value of human life,\\u201d Noah Feldman, a law professor at Harvard, wrote in a Bloomberg opinion column last year.\", \"What is clear is that the two disciplines\\u2019 models don\\u2019t line up: Each group emphasizes the part that it\\u2019s good at. The new working paper, whose authors are a mix of economists, epidemiologists and experts in related fields, notes that \\u201ca reasonable critique of most economic models\\u201d is that they make \\u201cstrong and unrealistic assumptions\\u201d about disease transmission that neglect the diversity of individual cases. But \\u201ca reasonable critique of most epidemiological models,\\u201d the paper continues, is that they fail to properly consider the sort of cost-benefit calculations that predictably influence how people behave in the face of health risks.\", \"So why not just mash up the models, combining the rich detail of each to create something that\\u2019s greater than the sum of its parts? It\\u2019s a good idea but not easy, in part because it can make a model too complex. Consider this intricate cycle: Covid-19 hits, so people stop working, so they spend less. As a result, demand for labor falls, so wages fall, so even more people stay at home \\u2026 so infection rates decline. Models of individual behavior that incorporate such feedback loops are sometimes \\u201cdifficult to solve even with vast amounts of computing power,\\u201d the authors write.\", \"This week I interviewed three of the authors to learn more about where this new effort came from and where it\\u2019s headed. The three are based at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, as are five of the other contributors. (Three additional authors are at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, the University of North Carolina and Washington University in St. Louis.)\", \"Nicholas Papageorge, an economist, explained that he initiated the effort last year because he felt that some people weren\\u2019t taking the economic harms caused by the pandemic shutdowns seriously enough. \\u201cThe conversation seemed to be about sourdough starter and catching up on Netflix,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI was deeply frustrated.\\u201d\", \"He and Robert Barbera, a former Wall Street economist now at Johns Hopkins, wrote a blog post with a Johns Hopkins epidemiologist, David Dowdy, about how the two groups needed to stop talking past each other. It criticized the \\u201cfacile story line\\u201d that the two groups were necessarily at odds. \\u201cAny hope of constructing an intelligent plan for the U.S. populace in the months ahead will require thoughtful collaboration, not conflict, between public health and economics professionals,\\u201d the post said.\", \"\\u201cNo one had sat down and said, \\u2018Why do we not seem to like each other very much?\\u2019\\u201d Papageorge recalled. \\u201cWe just hunker down in our silos and say the other group\\u2019s dumb.\\u201d\", \"He and another economist, Michael Darden at Johns Hopkins\\u2019s Carey Business School, got a grant from the Hopkins Business of Health Initiative to conduct six hours of frank discussions between economists and epidemiologists this past summer.\", \"\\u201cWe wanted to put something out there that would actually hit home,\\u201d Dowdy said. \\u201cPeople didn\\u2019t want to pull punches just to make a document that would sit well with everyone.\\u201d\", \"One strong conclusion of the group was that there really is a balance that must be struck between health and wealth, between lives and livelihoods. Not everyone agrees with that. Eleanor Murray, an epidemiologist at Boston University\\u2019s School of Public Health, wrote in the Journal of Economic Perspectives last year, \\u201cBut we need not choose between a healthy public and a healthy economy!\\u201d The authors of the new paper write that Murray \\u201cdownplays that a pandemic presents policymakers with difficult trade-offs between population health and economic well-being.\\u201d\", \"I asked Murray about that disagreement, and she said by email that \\u201cthe authors continue to place economics and epidemiology in opposition. The view that the economy and the health of the public are in conflict harms our ability to improve both.\\u201d She added that government support can minimize \\u201cboth transmission and economic harm.\\u201d (Papageorge\\u2019s emailed response: government aid \\u201cis not a costless proposition\\u201d and \\u201cthere is thus a trade-off\\u201d).\", \"The upshot of the six hours of talking, according to Darden, was that there should eventually be a unified model for combating disease transmission \\u201cthat retains the core elements that both economists and epidemiologists hold dear without becoming so big that it can\\u2019t be analyzed.\\u201d Achieving that, he continued, \\u201crequires a willingness to compromise.\\u201d\", \"Such a unified model is still a long way off. An interim step is to get economists and epidemiologists at least talking to each other and being clearer about where and why they disagree, said Papageorge. That step alone would make the two professions more useful to policymakers and the public.\", \"Thanks for your piece on Mark Spitznagel\\u2019s \\u201csafe haven\\u201d investing.
