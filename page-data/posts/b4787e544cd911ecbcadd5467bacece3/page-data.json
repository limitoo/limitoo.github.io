After being treated for gunshot wounds to her arm and leg, Ms. Douglas was able to identify two of four men responsible for the attack but could not identify the other two.\", \"\\u201cBy all accounts, Douglas was hysterical at the time, suffering from two gunshot wounds and having just witnessed the execution of three friends,\\u201d Judge Welsh wrote in his opinion. From a live lineup, Ms. Douglas later chose Mr. Strickland, who was in custody and was \\u201ca known associate\\u201d of two of the men Ms. Douglas had identified.\", \"The two men, Vincent Bell and Kilm Adkins, pleaded guilty in 1979 for their roles in the murders. In his testimony, Mr. Bell \\u201cremained adamant that Strickland was not present at the crime scene and played no part in the commission of the triple homicide,\\u201d the judge wrote.\", \"Within a year of Mr. Strickland\\u2019s conviction, Ms. Douglas began to reveal to those close to her that she had misidentified Mr. Strickland as an assailant in the attack, according to court records. It was not until 2009, however, that she sent an email to the Midwest Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to investigating and litigating for the wrongfully convicted.\", \"\\u201cI am seeking info on how to help someone that was wrongfully accused,\\u201d wrote Ms. Douglas, who died in 2015. \\u201cThis incident happened back in 1978, I was the only eyewitness and things were not clear back then, but now I know more and would like to help this person if I can.\\u201d\", \"Sometime after Ms. Douglas wrote the Midwest Innocence Project, Mr. Strickland also contacted the nonprofit seeking help. The group took up his case and began an investigation.\", \"In its own 2020 investigation, The Kansas City Star reported that Mr. Bell and Mr. Adkins had sworn that Strickland was not with them during the attack.\", \"The review of the case was made possible at the request of a Jackson County prosecutor who said that evidence used in Mr. Strickland\\u2019s conviction had been recanted or disproved, which prompted an evidentiary hearing in Mr. Strickland\\u2019s case two weeks ago.\", \"In his ruling, which was filed on Tuesday, Judge Welsh wrote: \\u201cThe Court\\u2019s confidence in Strickland\\u2019s convictions is so undermined that it cannot stand, and the judgment of conviction must be set aside. Absent Douglas\\u2019s positive, unequivocal identification of Strickland, there would have been no charge, no trial, and certainly no conviction.\\u201d\", \"Gov. Mike Parson of Missouri, a Republican, chose earlier this year not to pardon Mr. Strickland. Still, in posts on Twitter about Mr. Strickland\\u2019s exoneration on Tuesday, Governor Parson acknowledged that a bill he had signed into law this year \\u201ccreated a judicial procedure for prosecuting attorneys to use, in cases like this one, where the prosecutor believes that there was a miscarriage of justice and a wrongful conviction was entered.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe Court has made its decision, we respect the decision, and the Department of Corrections will proceed with Mr. Strickland\\u2019s release immediately,\\u201d Governor Parson said.\", \"After visiting his mother\\u2019s grave on Tuesday, Mr. Strickland went to dinner with friends, family members and Ms. Rojo Bushnell, his lawyer.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s described it as that there isn\\u2019t yet a word for the emotion that he has because it\\u2019s a little bit of so many things,\\u201d Ms. Rojo Bushnell said in the interview on Tuesday night, stepping away from the dinner. \\u201cThere\\u2019s joy, but there\\u2019s also sadness and grief and anger and all of that combined into one thing.\\u201d\", \"Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker, a Democrat, said that the exoneration \\u201cbrings justice \\u2014 finally \\u2014 to a man who has tragically suffered so so greatly as a result of this wrongful conviction.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cTo say we\\u2019re extremely pleased and grateful is an understatement,\\u201d Ms. Baker said.\", \"But not all were pleased. Missouri\\u2019s attorney general, Eric Schmitt, a Republican running for U.S. Senate in 2022, fought the exoneration. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday night.\", \"Mr. Strickland still faces several challenges. Because he was exonerated without DNA evidence, Mr. Strickland is not entitled to compensation from the state, his lawyer said. He will also need help getting an identification card, a bank account and clothing.\", \"\\u201cThese are all questions he\\u2019s never had to think about or been able to think about that he\\u2019ll be having to do very quickly,\\u201d Ms. Rojo Bushnell said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re ecstatic that he\\u2019s home, but we also just know that there\\u2019s nothing that will give him that time back.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b4787e544cd911ecbcadd5467bacece3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b4787e544cd911ecbcadd5467bacece3"}},
