Under the law, the full payments of $1,200 per single taxpayer and $2,400 for married couples were only available to single people earning less than $75,000 or couples with incomes below $150,000.\", \"Included among the billionaires who received stimulus checks are philanthropist George Soros, worth $7.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and financier Ira Rennert, worth $3.7 billion, the report noted. Soros' representative said he returned the check, while Rennert didn't respond to questions, ProPublica said.\\u00a0\", \"To be sure, the bulk of stimulus payments were directed to households that legitimately qualified for the checks, but the fact that billionaires received the aid underscores how differently the U.S. tax system works for the ultra-rich. The 270 wealthy people who got the checks most certainly didn't request the payments \\u2014 the IRS automatically directed the aid to anyone it determined qualified by income.\\u00a0\", \"It may seem mind-boggling that a billionaire could qualify for a $1,200 check from a stimulus program with an income threshold of $75,000 per single taxpayer. But because these billionaires tapped write-offs, deductions and other loopholes to minimize their incomes, they appeared to the IRS to have net incomes of less than zero, making them eligible for the payments.\", \"\\\"This disgrace is why we need real tax reform,\\\" the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning think tank, said on Twitter about the findings.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"ProPublica ... identified at least 18 billionaires who received stimulus payments, which were funded by U.S. taxpayers, in the spring of 2020. Hundreds of other ultrawealthy taxpayers also got checks.\\\"\", \"This disgrace is why we need real tax reform. https://t.co/Cm8p6hV4Jg\", \"The ProPublica report comes as some Democratic lawmakers are pushing for a tax on billionaires, arguing that the nation's wealthiest citizens should pay more as a matter of fairness. During the pandemic, the collective net worth of America's roughly 700 billionaires surged by $2 trillion, thanks to a rise in stock prices and the values of other assets,\\u00a0according\\u00a0to Americans for Tax Fairness, a left-leaning group.\", \"The billionaires tax would place a new levy on asset gains, whether a billionaire has sold the asset or not. Under current law, a gain is only taxed if it is \\\"realized\\\" when its owner sells the asset and books the profit. Unrealized gains \\u2014 stocks or other investments that rise in value and that the investor holds onto and leverage \\u2014 aren't currently taxed.\\u00a0\", \"But the finding that at least 18 American billionaires received stimulus checks earmarked for middle-income families reveals how differently the current tax system works for the wealthy.\\u00a0\", \"Most people pay taxes on earned income, such as their salaries or earnings from gig work, which is reported to the IRS on W2 or 1099 statements. The ultra-wealthy, however, have a host of accounting tricks and deductions they can use to reduce their reported income, such as by using business losses to offset income.
