According to TikToker @amberscxtt, her partner decided to pass the time during her labor induction by installing his gaming system in their room\\u2014and it's a choice that viewers appear to have mixed feelings about. The video has gone viral in the three days since it was posted, amassing 2 million views, 285,000 likes, and 14,000 comments.\", \"Induced labor is a process in which uterine contractions are created medically before they begin naturally. It's a relatively common procedure, and there are many reasons why a healthcare provider may suggest inducing labor\\u2014such as pregnancy complications or passing one's due date.\", \"Labor induction, however, can take a long time, depending on factors like the induction method and the individual patient. According to Parents magazine, \\\"inductions can last for hours, and in some cases, even days.\\\" As such, they advise future parents to \\\"head to the hospital with plenty of things to keep you busy as the hours pass.\\\"\", \"In the video, the on-screen text read: \\\"My boyfriend brought his entire gaming system to the hospital during my 21 hour induction.\\\"\", \"Meanwhile, the camera pans around the room, showing a video game console, a large monitor, and the TikToker's boyfriend, clad in a gaming headset, immersed in his game.\", \"While @amberscxtt seemed unfazed by her boyfriend's gaming, many viewers considered the act a \\\"red flag.\\\"\", \"\\\"Honestly this is disrespectful,\\\" wrote @ijwdance. \\\"I don't expect y'all to hold hands for 21 hours but he can't go without gaming for a day? Read a book or something.\\\"\", \"\\\"I was in labor for 38 hours and my husband is a huge gamer...and he never did this,\\\" commented @trees.leches. \\\"It's a special time you only get to experience once.\\\"\", \"Others, however, felt that these comments read too far into what was merely a funny clip. \\\"These comments are so dramatic for what,\\\" wrote @unapologeticallyhis.\", \"\\\"The amount of people trying to push their insecurities and sad lonely lives [onto] this couple is astonishing,\\\" echoed @thatguy12495.\", \"Some even shared similar stories of their own: \\\"No shame about it!! My induction took [three] days,\\\" wrote @genavive.russell. \\\"I told him to bring it. But when I needed him he stopped playing immediately.\\\"\", \"Despite the controversy, @amberscxtt said she doesn't have any regrets from her hospital stay.\", \"\\\"My boyfriend was VERY supportive, present, and loving during the entire birth of our son,\\\" she added. \\\"I would not have spent those 21 hours any other way.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935640/gamer.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A pregnant TikToker recently shared her boyfriend's gamin setup in her delivery room to pass the time until the baby was born.
