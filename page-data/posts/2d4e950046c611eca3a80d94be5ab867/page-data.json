But few had as personal a stake as Zalmay Khalilzad.\", \"Raised in Kabul and naturalized as a U.S. citizen, Mr. Khalilzad worked on Afghanistan policy under four American presidents before stepping down last month.\", \"The battle for Afghanistan is lost, for now. But Mr. Khalilzad has embarked on a new fight: to defend his reputation against accusations that he bears special blame for the chaotic fall of Kabul, the Afghan capital, to the Taliban in August.\", \"Mr. Khalilzad has been on a public-relations tour of sorts, sitting for numerous interviews in recent weeks to argue that he tried his best to broker peace despite vanishing leverage and an intransigent Afghan government. Calling his work incomplete, he is also applying unwelcome public pressure on the Biden administration to work with the Taliban.\", \"His critics say the deal he reached with the Taliban under President Donald J. Trump was either delusional or cynical, a means of providing thin political cover for America\\u2019s abandonment of his native country.\", \"Mr. Khalilzad \\u201cwas the architect of the grand deception scheme,\\u201d Amrullah Saleh, who served as Afghanistan\\u2019s first vice president until the Taliban took control of Kabul, tweeted on Oct. 28. He said that Mr. Khalilzad treated Afghanistan \\u201cas a sacrificial goat,\\u201d caring for it \\u201cto the moment of slaughter.\\u201d\", \"During a recent interview at his son\\u2019s high-rise apartment outside Washington, with sweeping views of the National Mall, Mr. Khalilzad rejected such criticism with a tone of bemused forbearance.\", \"\\u201cI respect those who say, \\u2018This was a defining war for the future of the Islamic world, and no matter what we must prevail,\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cWell, yeah. Sure, there\\u2019s a lot of things I wish for \\u2014 but it wasn\\u2019t realistic, because they couldn\\u2019t convince the presidents, Congress and others.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cI tried to say, \\u2018OK, America wants to leave militarily. But let\\u2019s do also the right thing for Afghanistan. Because given my Afghan-ness, I was very much in touch with the feelings of the Afghan people. I took the job in part to see if I could end the war also for Afghanistan, for the people.\\u201d\", \"The war ended on Mr. Khalilzad\\u2019s watch, but not on the terms he had hoped. Instead of the power-sharing government he imagined could restrain the Taliban, the militant group has assumed total control over the country, which is now facing economic collapse and famine.\", \"\\u201cZal emerges from this as a quite tragic figure,\\u201d said Eric S. Edelman, a former national security official who worked with Mr. Khalilzad under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.\", \"As colleagues at the Pentagon in the late 1980s, Mr. Edelman and Mr. Khalilzad helped drive U.S. policy in support of mujahedeen fighters in Afghanistan resisting Soviet occupiers. During the Bush administration, they again backed resistance fighters, who this time were battling the Taliban as the United States invaded in 2001.\", \"\\u201cHe did a lot to create a modern, post-Taliban independent state,\\u201d Mr. Edelman said of Mr. Khalilzad. \\u201cAnd then to be in part the handmaiden of its demise \\u2014 I don\\u2019t know how you can see that as other than tragic.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Khalilzad had been out of government for years when, during the 2016 presidential campaign, he introduced Mr. Trump for a foreign policy speech hosted by a think tank with which he was affiliated. A lifelong Republican, Mr. Khalilzad did not endorse Mr. Trump, noting his \\u201cprovocative views.\\u201d But the introduction earned him good will in Mr. Trump\\u2019s inner circle.\", \"Then, in 2018, Mr. Khalilzad told officials in the Trump administration that Taliban representatives were interested in talking about a peace agreement. That September, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appointed him envoy for \\u201cthe singular mission\\u201d of \\u201cdeveloping the opportunities to get the Afghans and the Taliban to come to a reconciliation.\\u201d\", \"In practice, however, the talks focused on the terms of the U.S. withdrawal that Mr. Trump sought. Eighteen months and hundreds of hours of bartering in Doha, the Qatari capital, produced an agreement in February 2020 under which the United States agreed to withdraw all its troops and the Taliban promised to halt attacks on American forces and never harbor terrorist groups.\", \"The deal also included a Taliban pledge to begin direct talks with the U.S.-backed government in Kabul, as Mr. Pompeo had directed. But the Afghan government was reluctant, and the Taliban seemed unwilling to compromise on their goal to establish a religiously based Islamic emirate.\", \"Critics say Mr. Khalilzad negotiated little more than a relatively safe U.S. retreat.\", \"\\u201cI believe Ambassador Khalilzad was too willing to make concessions to the Taliban and to throw the Afghan government under the bus,\\u201d said Lisa Curtis, who worked closely with Mr. Khalilzad in the Trump administration as the National Security Council\\u2019s senior director for South and Central Asia. \\u201cIt was clear to many people that the Taliban was not interested in a peace process, but only in pursuing a military path to power.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Khalilzad\\u2019s supporters say that he was handed an impossible task when he joined the Trump administration.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve been very critical of the February 2020 agreement that he negotiated,\\u201d Mr. Edelman said. \\u201cBut I will say in his defense: Trump cut the legs out from under it. What kind of negotiating leverage does he have when the president is repeatedly saying, \\u2018We\\u2019re going to get the hell out of Afghanistan!\\u2019\\u201d\", \"While he defends the agreement, Mr. Khalilzad also argues that the United States lost the will to fight in Afghanistan, partly because of the failures of \\u201cmy former military colleagues.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Curtis also noted that Mr. Khalilzad halted talks after a Taliban attack on Bagram Air Base, which killed two people and wounded 73 others \\u2014 none of them Americans \\u2014 but resumed them two days later. \\u201cIt made the U.S. look weak and desperate,\\u201d Ms. Curtis said.\", \"She lamented Mr. Khalilzad\\u2019s acceptance of a Taliban demand that the Afghan government release 5,000 Taliban prisoners, many of them hardened fighters, in exchange for only 1,000 prisoners. Mr. Khalilzad said that prisoner swaps were a traditional trust-building measure during peace negotiations.\", \"One leading critic of the U.S. withdrawal, Mr. Trump\\u2019s now estranged former national security adviser, John R. Bolton, does not blame Mr. Khalilzad.\", \"\\u201cI worried that Khalilzad was giving away too much, not because he was a poor negotiator, but because those were Pompeo\\u2019s instructions,\\u201d Mr. Bolton wrote in his 2020 memoir, \\u201cThe Room Where It Happened.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Bolton wrote that Mr. Trump once said of Mr. Khalilzad, in a meeting with several senior officials, \\u201cI hear he\\u2019s a con man, although you need a con man for this.\\u201d\", \"It was unclear what Mr. Trump meant. But Mr. Khalilzad has been the subject of complaints about his profitable leaps between government and the private sector, and, in at least one previously unreported instance, his workplace conduct.\", \"When the Taliban first took power in the 1990s, Mr. Khalilzad was a paid consultant for Unocal, a company exploring a possible oil pipeline through Afghanistan. He wrote at the time that the group \\u201cdoes not practice the anti-U. S. style of fundamentalism practiced by Iran\\u201d and called for American aid, which critics said could have benefited a pipeline project.\", \"Shortly after leaving the Bush administration, in which he had served as the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Mr. Khalilzad represented the investment board of the country\\u2019s semiautonomous Kurdistan region. He was then a board member of an oil and gas investment company in the Persian Gulf with a financial stake in Kurdistan.\", \"Mr. Khalilzad also underwent internal scrutiny at the State Department. Shortly before his departure, the department\\u2019s office of civil rights concluded a monthslong investigation into alleged workplace misconduct during the Bush administration. The Times reviewed emails from investigators sent in mid-August, days before the fall of Kabul, saying the report was headed to senior department officials. The officials believed Mr. Khalilzad had acted inappropriately, but the report did not recommend any disciplinary action.\", \"Mr. Khalilzad denied wrongdoing and said that the same claim had been investigated by the Trump administration and found to be without merit. He said the claim was reopened under Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken \\u201cwithout the opportunity for me to provide my full input.\\u201d\", \"A State Department spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Khalilzad\\u2019s case. The department\\u2019s office of civil rights, which handled the case, would not discuss its Trump-era inquiry.\", \"On Feb. 29, 2020, Mr. Khalilzad signed a four-page agreement that pledged the withdrawal of all U.S. troops by the following May.\", \"\\u201cToday is a day for hope,\\u201d Mr. Khalilzad said, sitting next to the Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Baradar in Doha.\", \"In the months afterward, U.S. troops began to draw down.\", \"After the election last year, Mr. Blinken asked Mr. Khalilzad to stay on, in recognition of his \\u201cdistinguished work\\u201d and the need for \\u201ccontinuity,\\u201d the State Department said at the time.\", \"In April, President Biden announced that he would fulfill Mr. Trump\\u2019s pledge to withdraw troops by September. But Mr. Khalilzad said that \\u201cBlinken, like myself and others, would have preferred a conditions-based approach, I believe.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Khalilzad continued to pursue a political settlement. With the Taliban demanding the resignation of President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan as a first step toward a transitional government, Mr. Khalilzad pressed him to accede.\", \"\\u201cThis is a historic opportunity for you,\\u201d he recalled telling Mr. Ghani. \\u201cImagine! Forty years of war, millions killed and injured. And you \\u2014 it\\u2019s during your period that Afghanistan ends its long nightmare.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Ghani refused. Critics say that Mr. Khalilzad\\u2019s pressure undermined the Afghan leader while legitimizing the Taliban.\", \"The two men have known each other for nearly 60 years, since their boyhood in Kabul, where Mr. Khalilzad recalled that his mother was protective of his physically smaller friend. \\u201cShe wanted to make sure that we weren\\u2019t roughing him up or anything,\\u201d he said.\", \"The men remained close after they moved to the United States for their education, but their relationship as adults has been colored by decades of ideological and political differences.\", \"Mr. Khalilzad denied that he had leaned excessively on Mr. Ghani. He also suggested that Mr. Ghani tragically miscalculated his leverage and failed to understand that the United States was truly leaving.\", \"As the Taliban closed in on Kabul in mid-August, Mr. Ghani fled the country, and his government collapsed. The war was finally over.\", \"Mr. Khalilzad stayed on for several more weeks, helping to evacuate Americans and at-risk Afghans and pressing the Taliban to form an inclusive government that respects human rights.\", \"On Oct. 18, Mr. Khalilzad submitted his resignation. America\\u2019s engagement with Afghanistan has entered a new phase, he said, one in which he was more useful as an independent voice \\u2014 particularly to make the case that the United States must work with the Taliban to help avert Afghanistan\\u2019s collapse into anarchy that could lead to a surge of refugees and breed terrorism.\", \"Asked whether he thought he would set foot again in the country of his birth, Mr. Khalilzad did not pause.\", \"\\u201cDefinitely,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe struggle for Afghanistan continues.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"2d4e950046c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2d4e950046c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
