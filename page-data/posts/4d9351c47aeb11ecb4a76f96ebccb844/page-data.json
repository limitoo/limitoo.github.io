She was 84.\", \"Her brother, Walter W. Arensberg, said the cause was complications of Covid-19.\", \"Ms. Arensberg came to writing relatively late in life, after an early career in museums and more than a decade as an editor at Viking Press. After publishing a few short stories in the 1970s, she finished her first novel, \\u201cSister Wolf,\\u201d in 1980, when she was 43.\", \"The tale of a young Hungarian American heiress who establishes a wolf sanctuary on her family\\u2019s estate in rural Massachusetts, the book established her reputation for conveying eccentric, detailed plots in witty, confidently unadorned prose.\", \"She described the book\\u2019s protagonist, Marit Deym, as having a love for animals \\u201cuntrammeled by suspicion, the kind of love that does not seek its own advantage, or negotiate for favorable terms. With human beings her insight foundered in mistrust. When animals bared their fangs, they were enraged; in humans a show of teeth was called a smile.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSister Wolf\\u201d was roundly praised by critics and won the 1981 National Book Award for best first novel, beating out Jean M. Auel\\u2019s mega-best seller, \\u201cThe Clan of the Cave Bear.\\u201d (Between 1979 and 1987, the awards were known as the American Book Awards, not to be confused with another, unrelated literary prize with the same name; they also included many more categories than they do today, including best first novel.)\", \"By then, she had settled in at the center of the Manhattan literary world, with a circle of friends that included the humorist Fran Lebowitz and the writers Janet Malcolm, Marie Brenner and Laurie Colwin. Gregarious and gently charismatic, she and her husband, the editor Richard Grossman, were fixtures at book parties and long Sunday brunches at their friends\\u2019 weekend houses, at a time when even a midlevel New York editor could afford one.\", \"\\u201cI think that she was aware of her allure, but not in an immodest way, and she drew people toward her as a way of learning about them,\\u201d her friend Alice Quinn, who edited her first two books at Knopf and later became the poetry editor at The New Yorker, said in an interview.\", \"Ms. Arensberg\\u2019s next book, the satirical \\u201cGroup Sex\\u201d (1986), grew out of a short story she had written in 1980 and drew on material closer at hand, including her own life. It told the story of a meek, eager-to-please book editor named Frances Girard who falls in love with her temperamental opposite: a brash, rebellious theater director named Paul Treat, best known, Ms. Arensberg wrote, for putting on a production of \\u201cAs You Like It\\u201d but with seals.\", \"Though Ms. Arensberg was far from the wallflower she depicted Frances to be, the character\\u2019s relationship with Paul drew on her own marriage, by then long ended, to the director John Hancock, who rose to early acclaim in 1967 with an avant-garde staging of \\u201cA Midsummer Night\\u2019s Dream\\u201d and later directed the movie \\u201cBang the Drum Slowly\\u201d (and, even later, was fired from the set of \\u201cJaws 2\\u201d).\", \"Reviews, this time, were mixed. Tama Janowitz, writing in The New York Times Book Review, praised Ms. Arensberg\\u2019s \\u201ctalent for entertainment and wit,\\u201d but Michiko Kakutani, also writing in The Times, said the book lacked a \\u201cmoral center.\\u201d\", \"By then Ms. Arensberg and Mr. Grossman had decamped for rural Connecticut, where they settled into a farmhouse outside Salisbury, in the state\\u2019s northwest corner. There, working in a chicken coop they had converted to a writing studio, she completed her final novel, \\u201cIncubus\\u201d (1999), about a Maine town overtaken by demons.\", \"That book could not have been more different from \\u201cGroup Sex,\\u201d though a bright thread ran through all her work that tied together themes about community, passion and the indistinct edges of human reason.\", \"\\u201cFrom our side, the frontiers of the underworld are all but impassable,\\u201d she wrote in \\u201cIncubus.\\u201d \\u201cAre the borders as hard to infiltrate from the other side? Are the flesh eaters, castaways and scarecrows we meet in dreams content to stay where they belong or do they want to travel? If they start to wander, how do we shut them out?\\u201d\", \"Ann Eveleth Arensberg was born in Pittsburgh on Feb. 21, 1937. Her father, Walter E. Arensberg, worked for a company that manufactured plate glass; when Ann was 9 he asked for a transfer overseas \\u2014 and was sent to Cuba.\", \"Her parents later divorced, and her father returned to the United States after the Cuban revolution. Her mother, Mariada (Comer) Arensberg, remained in Cuba for a few years, then moved to Washington, where she helped the C.I.A. establish and operate an anti-Castro radio station broadcast from Florida.\", \"Though Ms. Arensberg rarely spoke about her childhood in Havana, her friends said it infused her personality, from her lifelong interest in mystery and the occult to the Latin cooking she served them at her many dinner parties.\", \"\\u201cShe had this natural glamour, with this kind of exotic Cuban back story,\\u201d Ms. Brenner said in an interview. \\u201cAnd that back story powered her imagination in ways that just fueled her later literary success.\\u201d\", \"She studied art history at Radcliffe College and, after graduating in 1958, worked briefly at the Museum of Modern Art. She returned to Harvard to study French literature and received a master\\u2019s degree in 1962.\", \"Her first two marriages, to Pierre Leval and Mr. Hancock, ended in divorce. Mr. Grossman died in 2014. Along with her brother, she is survived by her stepdaughters, Joan Grossman, Nancy Nagle and Lucy Rochambeau. She lived in Salisbury, Conn.\", \"From 1967 to 1974 she was an editor at E.P. Dutton and Viking Press, where she worked with established writers like Don DeLillo and John Lahr and discovered new ones, like Ms. Colwin.\", \"\\u201cA good editor is a person who understands you and, as it were, eliminates your vulgarities,\\u201d Mr. Lahr, the former New Yorker theater critic, said in an interview. \\u201cAnd she certainly did that.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Arensberg said she decided to try writing during her separation from Mr. Hancock; they divorced in 1975, the same year she published her first short story, \\u201cArt History.\\u201d Ms. Quinn, at Knopf, read it and asked her to send a novel, if she ever had one. Five years later, she did.\", \"Never the most prolific writer, Ms. Arensberg took pride in her deliberative approach to research and composition, filling piles of yellow legal pads with her crisp boarding-school handwriting. And while she seemed to recall her many years as an editor with fondness, she counseled would-be writers to avoid following the same path.\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re going to write,\\u201d she told Publishers Weekly in 1999, \\u201cyou should not use up all your intuitive skills on other people\\u2019s writing. It\\u2019s better to do something physical, something mechanical \\u2014 sell gloves at Bloomingdale\\u2019s, be a turkey-plucker or a bartender. Anything.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4d9351c47aeb11ecb4a76f96ebccb844"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4d9351c47aeb11ecb4a76f96ebccb844"}},
