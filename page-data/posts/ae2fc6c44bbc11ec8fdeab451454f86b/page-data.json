Police made four arrests during the incident.\", \"The protest was related to an alleged sexual assault incident involving a student.\", \"\\\"This morning, students at Little Elm High school had planned a student demonstration inside the campus that caused some students to behave in a way that caused a major disruption,\\\" the Little Elm Independent School District (ISD) said in a statement released Friday. \\\"Four juvenile students were arrested for assaulting Little Elm Police officers.\\\"\", \"The district added: \\\"Officials from Little Elm ISD and Little Elm Police Department worked together to secure the scene to ensure the safety of everyone at the campus.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928908/police-tape-stock.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Police used pepper spray and a taser during a student protest in Texas on Friday.

The videos show the officers using pepper spray on a student before then using a taser on him. The four students arrested were accused of assaulting police officers.\", \"One student told local news station KDFW that pepper spray was used on multiple students. Peyton Yager, a reporter for the station, posted footage of the incident on Twitter. \", \"City spokesperson Erin Mudie told Fox News that the student who was tased received a medical examination before he was transported to a juvenile detention center by officers.\", \"On Sunday, Daniel Gallagher, superintendent of Little Elm ISD, posted a statement on Facebook that announced he would be holding a \\\"listening session\\\" on November 30 to \\\"allow our parents and community an opportunity to voice their concerns, thoughts, and provide suggestions to the District administration.\\\"\", \"He also said he would create an independent committee to review the district's sexual harassment reporting and investigation process; start an \\\"after-action review of Friday's incident\\\" by the district's Safety and Security Committee, and perform an independent investigation into the alleged sexual harassment incident that led to the demonstration.\"]","href_hash":"ae2fc6c44bbc11ec8fdeab451454f86b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ae2fc6c44bbc11ec8fdeab451454f86b"}},
