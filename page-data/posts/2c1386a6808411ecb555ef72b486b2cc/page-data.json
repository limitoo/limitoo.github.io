Trump, who met with Mr. Rittenhouse in Florida after his acquittal.\", \"At the same time, the images of Mr. Rittenhouse wielding a semiautomatic weapon on city streets during racial justice protests elicited widespread condemnation.\", \"Then 17 years old, Mr. Rittenhouse traveled from his home in rural Illinois to Kenosha as the city descended into civil unrest in August 2020 over the shooting of Jacob Blake by a police officer who had been responding to what the authorities said was a domestic complaint.
