Interlacing his visits to his folks in a Michigan lumber town with his reflections, the filmmaker reckons with the unfathomable loss of his niece, his vibrant sister\\u2019s rocky recoveries and being transgender in a traditional, Mormon environment.\", \"Any one of these subjects would be enough for a single film, but part of Minax\\u2019s point and method is how these experiences can illuminate one other. About ten years ago, his sister\\u2019s toddler daughter, Kalla, was found dead, a tragedy compounded by allegations of child abuse. But instead of a whodunit unraveling some fixed truth, Minax confronts the grief and guilt felt by all involved, even as he works through his own hurt over his parents\\u2019 evolving treatment of his identity.\", \"There\\u2019s an alchemy to what he accomplishes here, threading everyday scenes of parenting with fugues of home video and classic rock, and a bold double voice-over: his own, and a wise child persona that offers a cosmic perspective. This kind of personal film has often been attempted (even before \\u201cTarnation\\u201d made waves), but rarely with this insight. Minax succeeds, even as he includes a deeply conflicting revelation about himself that he could do more to address. Out of the fractured family documentary, what emerges finally is a drama of self-realization.\"]","href_hash":"5ed458ec3dc011ecb40c000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5ed458ec3dc011ecb40c000017025a03"}},
