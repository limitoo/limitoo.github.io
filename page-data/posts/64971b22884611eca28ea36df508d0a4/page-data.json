Now, amid those challenges, the agency must change how it verifies the identity of taxpayers.\", \"The I.R.S. said on Monday that it would \\u201ctransition away\\u201d from using a third-party service for facial recognition to help authenticate people creating new online accounts. The transition will occur over the coming weeks to prevent additional disruptions to the tax filing season, which ends April 18.\", \"At the center of the controversy is ID.me, an identity verification company that was awarded an $86 million contract by the Treasury Department last year to make taxpayer accounts more secure at a time when data leaks have been a growing concern. But the service, which requires taxpayers to take video selfies as part of the verification process, frustrated taxpayers and sparked concern that the tax collection agency could not be trusted with even more sensitive data.\", \"\\u201cThe I.R.S. takes taxpayer privacy and security seriously, and we understand the concerns that have been raised,\\u201d said Charles P. Rettig, the agency commissioner. \\u201cEveryone should feel comfortable with how their personal information is secured, and we are quickly pursuing short-term options that do not involve facial recognition.\\u201d\", \"The I.R.S. is developing another authentication process that does not involve facial recognition and is working with other agencies to develop tools to protect taxpayer data. The agency said that the change would not affect the ability of taxpayers to file their returns.\", \"A group of Republican senators expressed alarm last week in letter to Mr. Rettig, questioning the use of the software, which they described as \\u201cintrusive.\\u201d\", \"Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, expressed similar concerns in a letter to Mr. Rettig on Monday.\", \"\\u201cI have long argued that Americans should not have to sacrifice their privacy for security,\\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \\u201cThe government can treat Americans with respect and dignity while protecting against fraud and identity theft.\", \"ID.me did not address the matter directly on Monday, but it appeared to defend itself on Twitter.\", \"\\u201cFacial recognition is just one of the components we use to follow the federal standards,\\u201d the company said. \\u201cWithout it, the identity thieves behind these masks would be much more successful.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"64971b22884611eca28ea36df508d0a4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"64971b22884611eca28ea36df508d0a4"}},
