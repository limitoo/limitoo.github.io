But jump-starting the box office after pandemic shutdowns \\u2014 re-commandeering the culture \\u2014 has taken much longer than Hollywood envisioned.\", \"It finally happened Thursday, when \\u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\\u201d swung exclusively into theaters.\", \"\\u201cNo Way Home\\u201d collected $50 million from Thursday \\u201cpreview\\u201d screenings that started at 3 p.m., according to Sony Pictures Entertainment, which financed and produced the movie in partnership with Disney-owned Marvel Studios. It was the third-highest preview result on the Hollywood history books, behind \\u201cAvengers: Endgame\\u201d ($60 million) and \\u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\\u201d ($57 million).\", \"For the weekend in North America, \\u201cNo Way Home,\\u201d which received sensational reviews, could surpass $150 million in ticket sales. No movie has managed more than $90 million in opening-weekend sales since \\u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\\u201d in 2019, according to Comscore.\", \"\\u201cNo Way Home,\\u201d directed by Jon Watts, marks the end of a trilogy starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker and Zendaya as MJ, his plucky romantic counterpart. But the $200 million sequel also represents the culmination of nearly 20 years of Spider-Man movies \\u2014 eight in total \\u2014 because it draws in characters unseen since \\u201cSpider-Man 3\\u201d in 2007 and \\u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man 2\\u201d in 2014.\", \"Two people have been involved with the franchise in one capacity or another since its start: Amy Pascal and Kevin Feige. As the top movie executive at Sony from 1999 to 2015, Pascal was responsible for the first five live-action Spider-Man movies; she has produced the last three. Feige worked on the early Spider-Man movies in various capacities, initially in relative obscurity, and has been a producer of the last three in his role as president of Marvel Studios.\", \"The two spoke to me via video from their homes in Los Angeles. These are edited excerpts from the conversation, including \\u2014 beware \\u2014 some \\u201cNo Way Home\\u201d spoilers.\", \"Let\\u2019s start with an easy one. Kevin, please lay out your future Marvel Cinematic Universe road map for Spider-Man. I want details.\", \"FEIGE What?\", \"What\\u2019s the next M.C.U. crossover movie? \\u201cDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,\\u201d coming in May? Maybe that \\u201cFantastic Four\\u201d reboot? Don\\u2019t say \\u201cI don\\u2019t know\\u201d because I know you know.\", \"FEIGE He\\u2019s going to show up sometime. The when and the where, of course, is the fun part \\u2014 and the part that we don\\u2019t talk about.\", \"What about the next stand-alone Spider-Man movie? Amy, you said last month that you and Kevin \\u2014 Sony and Disney \\u2014 are going to collaborate on three more, which seemed to catch the studios by surprise.\", \"PASCAL We\\u2019re producers, so we always believe everything will work out. I love working with Kevin. We have a great partnership, along with Tom Rothman, who runs Sony and has been instrumental, a great leader with great ideas. I hope it lasts forever.\", \"That sounds like a classic Hollywood walk back.\", \"FEIGE Amy and I and Disney and Sony are talking about \\u2014 yes, we\\u2019re actively beginning to develop where the story heads next, which I only say outright because I don\\u2019t want fans to go through any separation trauma like what happened after \\u201cFar From Home\\u201d [the previous Spider-Man movie, in 2019]. That will not be occurring this time.\", \"PASCAL At the end of the movie we just made, you see Spider-Man make a momentous decision, one that you\\u2019ve never seen him make before. It\\u2019s a sacrifice. And that gives us a lot to work with for the next film.\", \"This movie, \\u201cNo Way Home,\\u201d pulls in major characters \\u2014 and stars \\u2014 from the franchise going back 20 years. How are you ever going to top it?\", \"PASCAL Not every Spider-Man movie is going to be a multitude of characters. That approach was right for this one.\", \"You can\\u2019t think about topping yourself in terms of spectacle. Otherwise movies just get larger and larger for no reason, and it\\u2019s not a good result. But we do want to always try and top ourselves in terms of quality and emotion. Kevin and I never want to lose sight of one thing: Peter Parker. That he\\u2019s a normal kid. That he is orphaned over and over again. That he\\u2019s a teenager, so everything in his life is at a heightened pitch and everything matters more than anything. That he\\u2019s fueled by goodness and guilt. That he\\u2019s striving for a greater cause, and he\\u2019s vilified by the press.\", \"What was the biggest \\u201cNo Way Home\\u201d producing challenge?\", \"FEIGE Getting everybody to agree with you about the cool, big idea. \\u201cHey, we have an idea. Will you come sign up and be in this movie.\\u201d \\u201cCool! Can I read the script?\\u201d \\u201cNo.\\u201d That was the hardest part. And that\\u2019s where Amy, who calls anyone anywhere at any time, is a master producer at making things happen.\", \"I read somewhere, Amy, that you FaceTimed with Tom Holland while he was in the bathtub. Do you have any screen grabs so I can verify that information?\", \"That is true. And, no, I\\u2019m not sharing.\", \"Who was the last \\u201cNo Way Home\\u201d star to sign on?\", \"FEIGE Not who you think. It\\u2019s not worth talking about, but not who you think.\", \"What was your pitch to the actors who were skeptical?\", \"PASCAL That these weren\\u2019t going to be cash-grab cameos. The parts were real. That I was there with them the first time and would be again, that I have too much respect for them and all the work we did together over the years.\", \"Why weren\\u2019t Kirsten Dunst and Emma Stone, the female leads from previous Spider-Man movies, brought back for this one?\", \"FEIGE When people see the movie, they will understand. It\\u2019s about the story. It was a big goal for all of us \\u2014 Amy and Jon and our writers, Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers \\u2014 that Peter Parker\\u2019s senior year in high school didn\\u2019t get lost amid the insanity that ensues thanks to his encounter with Doctor Strange. That easily could have happened. And that\\u2019s the reason there\\u2019s not another 20 people in the movie.\", \"Speaking of women, are we ever going to see a woman with superpowers alongside Spider-Man? Isn\\u2019t there a story line in the comics where MJ gets to take the Iron Spider armor for a spin?\", \"PASCAL Never say never. [She offers a coy smile.]\", \"FEIGE We have a lot of story lines, Brooks! A lot of story lines. It comes down to these great, great actors. My guess is your question is less about what MJ did in the comics and more about \\u201cZendaya is really great. Can we see more of her?\\u201d\", \"Tobey and Kirsten. Emma and Andrew. Tom and Zendaya. Why do all your lead actors end up falling for each other in real life? It can\\u2019t just be the spandex.\", \"PASCAL I took Tom and Zendaya aside, separately, when we first cast them and gave them a lecture. Don\\u2019t go there \\u2014 just don\\u2019t. Try not to. I gave the same advice to Andrew and Emma. It can just complicate things, you know? And they all ignored me.\", \"Can you give Tom some advice from me? Don\\u2019t lie to reporters! In interviews over the past year, he said Tobey and Andrew were not coming back.\", \"PASCAL Well, he can\\u2019t reveal things that are in the movie. You wouldn\\u2019t expect him to do that. Forgive him.\", \"One last question for you: What is the truth about how the Pascal-Feige producing collaboration started? My understanding is that you, Amy, then running Sony, made the 2014 \\u201cAmazing Spider-Man\\u201d sequel, which was rather wobbly. And that you called Kevin and said, \\u201cHelp.\\u201d\", \"PASCAL That is the truth. I called Kevin and said, \\u201cHelp.\\u201d And then he came over to my office for lunch and said, \\u201cI know how to help you.\\u201d And then I threw a sandwich at him.\", \"FEIGE She said, \\u201cI really want you to help on this next movie. We have these great ideas for the next one. It\\u2019s amazing stuff.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m not good at that \\u2014 giving advice and leaving. The only way I know how to help is if we just make the movie for you.\\u201d\", \"Cut to the flying B.L.T. or whatever it was.\", \"FEIGE It was a pretty low-key sandwich. I don\\u2019t remember what kind. But, yes, she did not like that suggestion.\", \"PASCAL And then Kevin called me and came over to the house and said, \\u201cI have an idea. What if Tony Stark makes Peter\\u2019s suit?\\u201d And as soon as he said that, I understood the possibilities of what we could do together. To have Iron Man and Spidey in the same world, one rooted more in technological innovation \\u2014 the new suit \\u2014 and less in medical experimentation, which is where we were confined before, felt so much more modern.\", \"It has taken a lot of work. But just look at the results. Pretty fantastic, right?\"]","href_hash":"2ed6bfe45f7711ecb6ba51ce820f3b40"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2ed6bfe45f7711ecb6ba51ce820f3b40"}},
