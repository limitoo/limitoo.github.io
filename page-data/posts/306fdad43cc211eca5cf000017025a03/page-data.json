Walensky said that while she recognizes some parents may not feel comfortable with the idea, the CDC has taken the time \\\"to get this right.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We've done the incredible due diligence to take the time to get it right and we know parents have questions and we want to give parents the information that they need, communicate with them and have them ask the questions of their trusted messengers, hear their pediatricians, their pharmacists, and that is where we will be distributing the vaccine,\\\" she said.\", \"With the CDC'S greenlight, 28 million American children between the ages of 5 to 11 years old are now eligible to receive Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine at one-third of the dosage offered to adolescents and adults. Walensky said the lower dosage recommendation came after several clinical trials. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"So what they have done in these clinical trials is to look at dose de-escalation, to make sure that the younger children are getting the right dose, both to balance the effectiveness and make sure that it's actually working well and to make sure there were no side effects of it. They absolutely hit that sweet spot at this stuff at this dose,\\\" she said.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"306fdad43cc211eca5cf000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"306fdad43cc211eca5cf000017025a03"}},
