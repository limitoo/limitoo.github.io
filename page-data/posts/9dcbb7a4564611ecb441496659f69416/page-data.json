heritage assessments showing the areas are scattered with artefacts.\", \"The projects \\u2014 drilling by a mining exploration company and a high-tech battery \\u2014 are on the traditional lands of the Kuyani and Adnyamathanha people in the western Flinders Ranges.\", \"The projects were assessed by the Viliwarinha Yura Aboriginal Corporation (VYAC) less than six months apart, but in both cases, Indigenous surveyors found works had already started and significant sites had been disturbed.\", \"VYAC member and traditional owner Regina McKenzie fears\\u00a0SA will\\u00a0one day see an incident as devastating as the Juukan Gorge scandal.\", \"\\\"That's the thing that I'm worried about,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'They were actually drilling'</div>\", \"Strikeline Resources, a subsidiary of Taruga Minerals, is licensed to explore for minerals near Hawker.\", \"The area incorporates\\u00a0past and present hunting grounds, ceremonial areas and a massacre site, and is a significant location in at least three traditional storylines.\", \"According to the cultural heritage report produced after VYAC's survey of the site, traditional owners only became aware of the exploration work by chance.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a25b8cbd0183a5d67c4e4a117c919342\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The

pads and created new roads.\", \"Traditional owners visited to conduct\\u00a0an archaeological and cultural heritage survey over two days in December 2020.\", \"The resulting report found quartzite and sandstone artefacts were scattered across the project site, with high concentration in some areas.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Kuyani people overlooked as stakeholders</div>\", \"The cultural heritage report alleged Strikeline continually tried to speed up the survey process.\", \"\\\"Notwithstanding the clearly disturbed areas such as roads, tracks and quarries ... the archaeological character of the two vast areas could not be defined in two days,\\\" the report said.\", \"In a statement, Strikeline said the scope of the survey was agreed with VYAC beforehand and it believed it provided adequate time and resources.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d87c3235de7ff93f7872ba8585e94d81\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Ms

Association because of the area's proximity to the Adnyamathanha native title area, but was informed it was entering administration and was not able to participate.\", \"It did not identify the Kuyani people or VYAC as interested parties and said neither had native title rights over the project area.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">High-tech battery workers 'jumped the gun'</div>\", \"A short

went to survey the site at Neuroodla over three days in May 2021, but found work had already begun, including 15 steel poles that had been driven into the ground.\", \"\\\"They told us that their contractors jumped the gun,\\\" Ms McKenzie said.\", \"On the third day of the survey, the team found out a beloved relative had died, and had to return to Port Augusta to mourn.\", \"The Flinders Ranges Council approved the development based on the alternative report, despite an unfinished, preliminary report prepared for VYAC identifying dozens of artefacts and areas of cultural significance.\", \"The VYAC report found part of the site potentially held human remains, and the project required a cultural heritage management strategy.\", \"<img
