In her new book, \\u201cLost & Found,\\u201d which grew out of a previously published essay, she addresses a more personal cataclysm: the death of her father, Isaac Schulz.\", \"Describing his last moments in a hospital room at 74 (on the earlier side, in these days of sophisticated geriatric medicine, but hardly premature, she acknowledges), Schulz\\u2019s prose is not so much purple as lavender: a curtain drawn calmly around the beloved\\u2019s body. \\u201cI could not stop picturing the way he used to push his glasses up onto his forehead to read,\\u201d she writes in an extended passage describing the immediate aftermath. \\u201cIt struck me, right before everything else struck me much harder, that I should set them by his bed in case he needed them.\\u201d\", \"Isaac, absent-minded about the physical world but fluent in six languages, loved to read, casually cracking the spines of paperbacks as others might lobsters. He imparted a fierce intellectual appetite to his daughters that pulses through these pages. (Schulz\\u2019s older sister, Laura, is a professor of cognitive science at M.I.T.) Polymathic if not polyglot herself, the author revels in the specificity of figures: We lose an average of nine objects a day, she reports, and spend six months of our lives searching for them; contemplating the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, she notes without shudder that 180 billion planes could nestle comfortably on the bottom of the Indian Ocean.\", \"Sometimes old-fashioned in her syntax, using phrases like \\u201cset about\\u201d and \\u201cI suppose,\\u201d Schulz likes to turn parts of speech over and examine them, like stones. \\u201cCosmopolitan\\u201d describes her girlfriend, \\u201cin that beautiful root sense of the word: a citizen of the cosmos.\\u201d The couple\\u2019s more affectionate cat is \\u201cexceedingly thigmotactic.\\u201d The rest of us procrastinate; Schulz \\u201ccircumjoviates.\\u201d And you might know Venus and Hermes from ancient mythology, but have you been introduced to the more obscure figures Tacita, silent goddess of death, and Anteros, god of requited love?\", \"Isaac, along with modeling erudition, seems to have been a warm and fascinating man, all the more grounded for his considerable itineration: born in Tel Aviv and raised in a kibbutz as the Holocaust decimated much of his mother\\u2019s family in Poland, detouring improbably to postwar Germany and then Detroit, selling used clothes in Illinois, jerking soda in Manhattan and deploying to Korea before settling in Cleveland as a lawyer. \\u201cHe had a booming voice, a heavy accent, a formidable mind, a rabbinical beard, a Santa Claus belly and the gestural range of the Vitruvian Man,\\u201d Schulz writes in a model of effective eulogy: homage to the vanished corporeal form; placement in culture\\u2019s eternal pantheon. \\u201cCollectively, the effect was part Socrates, part Tevye.\\u201d\", \"Against such a colorful character, made more vivid by his absence, others can\\u2019t help fading.\", \"Schulz strains to describe the state of bereavement, whose scudding emotions are presented as curious novelties but will be familiar to anyone who\\u2019s been there. \\u201cTo be prepared is not to be spared,\\u201d she writes, as if needlepointing a pillow. In death\\u2019s wake, Schulz finds herself clumsy, anxious, K\\u00fcbler-Ross angry (\\u201calbeit thinly\\u201d); she is OK and then not-so-OK and then OK again. \\u201cLike anything that goes on for too long,\\u201d she admits, \\u201cgrief is (I don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t talk about this aspect of it more often) unbelievably boring.\\u201d\", \"More radically, Schulz\\u2019s book torques the grief memoir into a M\\u00f6bius strip, placing the totalizing experience of loss \\u2014 to be almost geographically, directionally \\u201cat a loss,\\u201d as she palpates that particular stone \\u2014 on a continuum with the summons of romantic and even religious love: with being \\u201cfound.\\u201d Schulz is Jewish; her partner, fellow author and New Yorker staff writer Casey Cep, here identified rather coyly as C., is Lutheran. There are also class and regional differences between the pair, and not since Barnes met Noble has the ampersand gotten such a workout, analyzing the miracle of their conjoining.\", \"The couple\\u2019s love story can have the earnest, burbling quality of a wedding journal, filled as it is with cafe chats, a second date lasting 19 days, long hikes, wildflowers, road trips, thigmotactic bedtime cuddles and bursts of pathetic fallacy. \\u201cGod knows, we were a dappled bunch that day,\\u201d Schulz writes of their storm-punctuated nuptials, riffing on Gerard Manley Hopkins. (Elizabeth Bishop\\u2019s famous poem about losing, \\u201cOne Art,\\u201d also prominently figures.)\", \"If you can tolerate a little schmaltz, though, stick with Schulz. Against the current Netflix climate-change satire, \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up,\\u201d she does cast her gaze unflinchingly into the heavens \\u2014 plus down and sideways, even if it leaves her own flanks vulnerable. A mysterious story about a boy finding a meteorite ingeniously boomerangs, coincidences mount, patterns emerge, junk proves valuable and she chooses to \\u201ctake the side of amazement.\\u201d In an ocean of churning cynicism and despair, this is a winning bet.\"]","href_hash":"fa04b9886d9a11ecb6a5b3a5eb9ce4a9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fa04b9886d9a11ecb6a5b3a5eb9ce4a9"}},
