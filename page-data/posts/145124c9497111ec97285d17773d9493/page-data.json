Others think it could have something to do with prior infections with other diseases or the fact that people across the continent are more used to dealing with outbreaks even without vaccines.\", \"In the AP report, researchers in Uganda said Friday that they found COVID-19 patients who had previously been exposed to malaria were less likely to show severe symptoms or die.\", \"Jane Achan, a senior research advisor at the Malaria Consortium and a co-author of the study, told the AP they went into the project thinking previous malaria exposure would make COVID-19 infections worse.\", \"\\\"We were actually quite surprised to see the opposite\\u2014that malaria may have a protective effect,\\\" Achan said.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936595/zimbabwe-harare-africa.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">When the coronavirus first emerged last year, health officials feared the pandemic would sweep across Africa, killing millions and destroying the continent\\u2019s fragile health systems.

But for now, African authorities, while acknowledging that there could be gaps, are not reporting huge numbers of unexpected fatalities that might be COVID-related. WHO data show that deaths in Africa make up just 3 percent of the global total. In comparison, deaths in the Americas and Europe account for 46 percent and 29 percent, respectively.\", \"In Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, the government has recorded nearly 3,000 deaths so far among its 200 million population. The U.S. records that many deaths every two or three days.\", \"The low numbers have Nigerians like Opemipo Are, a 23-year-old in Abuja, feeling relieved. \\\"They said there will be dead bodies on the streets and all that, but nothing like that happened,\\\" she said.\", \"On Friday, Nigerian authorities began a campaign to significantly expand the West African nation's coronavirus immunization. Officials are aiming to inoculate half the population before February, a target they think will help them achieve herd immunity.\", \"Oyewale Tomori, a Nigerian virologist who sits on several WHO advisory groups, suggested Africa might not even need as many vaccines as the West. It's an idea that, while controversial, he said is being seriously discussed among African scientists\\u2014and is reminiscent of the proposal British officials made last March to let COVID-19 freely infect the population to build up immunity.\", \"That doesn't mean, however, that vaccines aren't needed in Africa.\", \"\\\"We need to be vaccinating all out to prepare for the next wave,\\\" said Salim Abdool Karim, an epidemiologist at South Africa's University of KwaZulu-Natal, who previously advised the South African government on COVID-19. \\\"Looking at what's happening in Europe, the likelihood of more cases spilling over here is very high.\\\"\", \"In Zimbabwe, doctors were grateful for the respite from COVID-19\\u2014but feared it was only temporary.\", \"\\\"People should remain very vigilant,\\\" warned Dr. Johannes Marisa, president of the Medical and Dental Private Practitioners of Zimbabwe Association.
