More than a century later, 5,400 bison roam the fertile grounds of Yellowstone National Park.\", \"But now, there are too many bison, according to the National Park Service.\", \"Wildlife officials and tribal entities agreed on Wednesday that as many as 900 bison from Yellowstone National Park would be slaughtered, shot by hunters or placed in quarantine at the service\\u2019s Stephens Creek Capture Facility, where the animals will be tested for brucellosis, a disease that causes abortions or stillbirths in cattle.\", \"The horned, furry mammals have been overgrazing the land \\u2014 causing possible mass starvation of other animals \\u2014 and roaming into Montana, where farmers fear their cattle could become infected by brucellosis, the service said.\", \"\\u201cDoing nothing is not a realistic option,\\u201d the service said on its website, explaining why it was permitting the killing of an animal that was once at risk of extinction.\", \"Most areas around Yellowstone continue to limit where bison are allowed, and human development on its habitat has hindered expansion of its range, the service said.\", \"While wolves have recently made a healthy comeback in the park, they have had little effect in reducing the number of bison, which can stand six feet tall, weigh 2,000 pounds and defend themselves easily as a group against predators.\", \"Official said the bison would not be hunted inside Yellowstone, unlike in Grand Canyon National Park, where this year hunters were allowed for the first time to kill bison inside the park because they were causing havoc to the area\\u2019s ecosystem.\", \"The Yellowstone bison have been increasing by 10 to 17 percent every year. Over the past two decades, wildlife officials have tried to curb some of that rapid growth, issuing yearly guidelines on how many bison should be killed.\", \"Still, the park service said that the hunting had done little to solve the problem.\", \"\\u201cThose bison are very wary,\\u201d said Chad Kremer, the owner of Kremer Buffalo Company, which raises and harvests bison in South Dakota. \\u201cThey learn. They learn where those property boundaries are, where those limits are that they get pressure from the outside during the hunt.\\u201d\", \"Indeed, the service documented only two bison that were shot outside the park last year. Most of the 834 bison removed last year were herded into the Stephens Creek Capture Facility, tested for brucellosis and then transferred to tribes, which take the animals to slaughterhouses.\", \"In 2019, the service introduced a program in which bison that don\\u2019t have brucellosis are transferred to new areas instead of slaughterhouses. That year, 55 bison were relocated to the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in northeastern Montana.\", \"Members of the tribes also have the option to hunt bison.\", \"\\u201cElders tell of a sincere and deep respect that when the wild roses bloomed in the late spring or early summer, they knew the bison calves were fatten up, and it was time to \\u2018go to the bison,\\u2019\\u201d the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes said on a hunting orientation page.\", \"When a bison is hunted, it\\u2019s usually \\u201ca harvest,\\u201d Mr. Kremer said, because \\u201cthey\\u2019re so large, and they don\\u2019t typically have predators.\\u201d\", \"As for the fear that the bison could spread brucellosis, Mr. Kremer said it was \\u201cdefinitely a concern\\u201d but not a significant one. The National Park Service agreed, saying that \\u201cpeople both understate and overstate the risk of brucellosis transmission.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cTransmission of brucellosis from bison to livestock is possible,\\u201d the service said, but as of October there had not been a documented case of transmission from bison in Yellowstone to cattle.\", \"That does not mean that it could never happen, the service said, adding that it meant only that efforts by Montana and the service to prevent the commingling of bison and cattle had worked so far.\", \"Donnis Baggett, the president of the National Bison Association, a trade group, said on Sunday that elk seemed to be driving the spread of brucellosis.\", \"\\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t seem to get much attention and discussion,\\u201d Mr. Baggett said. \\u201cEverybody blames it on the bison.\\u201d\", \"The National Park Service said that elk were also infected, and that their movements outside the park were not restricted. \", \"When the hunting of bison does begin, Mr. Kremer said, some people will get to enjoy a high-protein meat this winter.\", \"\\u201cIt tastes like beef,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbut really lean.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ca25039e562011ec9accc9252c4785d2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ca25039e562011ec9accc9252c4785d2"}},
