Can we do this for another 10-15 years together,\\\" he had said over the radio.\", \"\\\"We needed a bit of luck and we got it,\\\" said team boss Christian Horner.\", \"The race at Yas Marina started and ended in controversy but without the collision many had feared.\", \"There were tears of joy at Red Bull and rage at Mercedes, whose fury was directed at Australian race director Michael Masi as the drivers' title disappeared so close to the chequered flag.\", \"Red Bull, whose partners Honda are now departing the sport, had said during the race that they needed a miracle to win as Hamilton made the most of a quicker car to head towards the title.\", \"A late safety car intervention, after Canadian Nicholas Latifi crashed with five laps to go, provided hope and it was game on when Masi decided not to let all lapped cars pass the safety car before resuming racing.\", \"That allowed Verstappen - on fresher, faster tyres after strategic stops - to close and go wheel-to-wheel with Hamilton for the lead.\", \"At one point it had seemed the race could finish behind the safety car as marshals took time to remove Latifi's stranded Williams.\", \"\\\"We were screaming at the end to let them race,\\\" said Horner. \\\"It is unheard of to leave the cars unlapped. They wanted to get the race going again. They absolutely made the right call.\\\"\", \"Hamilton, who had been heading for a fourth successive race win and 104th of his career, congratulated the new champion.\", \"\\\"I think we did an amazing job this year.
