The Department of Labor issued the mandate last week, which requires businesses with at least 100 employees to institute a vaccine-only policy or have unvaccinated employees wear masks and submit to weekly testing.\", \"More than 20 states filed lawsuits against the mandate, alleging infringements on the Constitution and federal government overreach. Department of Labor officials have defended the emergency temporary standard as being no different than others that Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued in the past.\", \"The Biden administration argued in a court filing that OSHA has the ability to implement the temporary standard, in part because of the \\\"grave\\\" danger that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to the public. The government wrote the vaccine or testing requirements could save thousands of lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, an outcome that far outweighs the petitioners' claimed injuries.\", \"\\\"Staying this Standard would endanger many thousands of people,\\\" the court filing said. \\\"Petitioners' asserted injuries, by contrast, are speculative and remote and do not outweigh the interest in protecting employees from a dangerous virus while this case proceeds.\\\"\", \"Biden first announced the nationwide mandate in September, but said the final details would be left up to the Department of Labor to iron out. That final guidance was released last week and gives companies a choice to require employees be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing and wear a mask when around other employees.
