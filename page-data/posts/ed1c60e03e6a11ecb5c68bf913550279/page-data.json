That\\u2019s the threshold beyond which many scientists say the planet will experience catastrophic effects from heat waves, droughts, wildfires and flooding. The average global temperature has already risen by 1.1 degrees Celsius.\", \"So far, leaders and business executives have made some significant commitments. On Tuesday, more than 100 countries agreed to cut emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, by 30 percent by 2030. And, on Wednesday, a coalition of the world\\u2019s biggest investors, banks and insurers that collectively control $130 trillion said they were committed to financing projects that would help get companies and countries to net-zero emissions by 2050.\", \"Environmentalists, however, criticized the financing pledge as lacking in detail. Several key leaders, including President Xi Jinping of China, Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, were also criticized for not attending the event in person. Environmentalists say that China and Russia\\u2019s targets are not ambitious enough, and activists are skeptical that Mr. Bolsonaro will follow through on his country\\u2019s pledge to end deforestation by 2028.\", \"Ms. Nakate, a 24-year-old climate activist from Uganda and founder of the Africa-based Rise Up Movement, said at the panel discussion on Thursday that the pledge by leaders of the 20 largest economies to \\u201cpursue efforts\\u201d to keep the average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius did not go far enough.\", \"She said that 1.5 degrees would \\u201cnot be safe\\u201d for communities like hers. \\u201cEven right now, it\\u2019s already evident that the climate crisis is ravaging different parts of the African continent,\\u201d Ms. Nakate said.\", \"Ms. Yousafzai, 24, said that women were disproportionately impacted by the climate crisis.\", \"\\u201cTreating climate change and gender inequality and girls\\u2019 education as separate issues is not doing justice to the cause of creating a fairer and better and cleaner world for all of us,\\u201d Ms. Yousafzai said. \\u201cIt is important that we take these issues seriously and see the link between all of these.\\u201d\", \"She and the other activists on Thursday said there was reason for hope. When the moderator at Ms. Thunberg\\u2019s event asked what one fact the panelists would want everyone in the world to know, she said that people should understand that their individual actions can make a difference. The changes that are necessary will not come from inside of conferences like COP26, she said.\", \"\\u201cThis is the misconception,\\u201d Ms. Thunberg said. \\u201cThat what we as individuals do doesn\\u2019t have an impact.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not talking about not using plastic and so on,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019m talking about going out onto the streets and making our voices heard, organizing marches, demanding change.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ed1c60e03e6a11ecb5c68bf913550279"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ed1c60e03e6a11ecb5c68bf913550279"}},
