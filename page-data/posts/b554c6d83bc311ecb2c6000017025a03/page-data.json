Health Service (CQHHS) workers have failed to comply with the COVID-19 vaccination mandate, forcing cuts to surgical, medical and mental health beds.\", \"Queensland Health data obtained by the ABC shows that, of the 4,620 employees who work for the service \\u2014\\u00a0which runs Rockhampton, Gladstone, Biloela and Emerald hospitals \\u2014\\u00a0385 workers have provided no evidence of having two COVID-19\\u00a0vaccine shots and are not on leave.\", \"About 136 of them have requested an exemption from the mandate but Queensland Health director-general John Wakefield has made it clear anyone who has not been vaccinated against COVID-19 will not be allowed to work in a public health facility.\", \"An email from the CQHHS Rockhampton business unit executive director Kerrie-Anne Frakes to staff said the mandate would have a \\u201ctemporary operational impact to ensure that we are able to safely maintain inpatient services\\u201d.\", \"\\u201cThere has been a great deal of work done by our team leaders, managers and directors this past week to ensure safe service continuity,\\u201d the email said.\", \"Ms Frakes said the service would be temporarily required to reduce some surgical, medical and mental health beds and balance \\u201ca slight reduction of staff in emergency departments and maternity wards\\u201d.\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t, however, believe that these changes will impact the level of care to be provided to our community nor impact the safety of our staff,\\u201d she said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Suspended on full pay</div>\", \"Of the 108,000-strong Queensland Hospital and Health Services workforce, 3,830 \\u2014 or 3.54 per cent \\u2014 have provided no evidence of a COVID-19 vaccination and are not on leave.\", \"Health Minister Yvette D\\u2019Ath said this week about 4,000 Queensland Health workers who had not been vaccinated against COVID-19 would be sent show-cause notices and be suspended on full pay.\", \"The state is currently served by 16 Hospital and Health Services, independent statutory bodies responsible for delivering public health services in their area.\", \"South West Hospital and Health Service (SWHHS) \\u2014\\u00a0which takes in the Roma, St George, Cunnamulla and Charleville hospitals \\u2014\\u00a0has the highest percentage of non-complying employees, with 10.78 per cent of the workforce, or 110 employees, out of a total of 1,020.\", \"Other Hospital and Health Services with high rates of workers not vaccinated against COVID-19 include Central West (6.2 per cent), Sunshine Coast (5.33 per cent), Mackay (5.07 per cent), Wide Bay (4.42 per cent) and Gold Coast (4.07 per cent).\", \"In terms of sheer numbers, 561 employees at the Metro North Hospital and Health Service (MNHHS) \\u2014\\u00a0which includes the Royal Brisbane and Women\\u2019s, The Prince Charles, Redcliffe, Caboolture and Kilcoy hospitals \\u2014\\u00a0have failed to comply with the health directive, which

said workers who put in exemption requests and had not been contacted yet would receive full pay for this week.\", \"\\\"After that, the process will continue and it will be individually based,
