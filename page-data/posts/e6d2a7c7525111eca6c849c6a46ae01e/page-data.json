Simmons, a Black police officer in Virginia Beach, responded to reports of gunfire at a parking lot on a March night during which several people were injured and at least one woman was killed. Simmons reportedly saw Lynch holding a gun, which Simmons believed he was pointing at the crowd to fire at the people and police officers in the parking lot.\", \"Prosecutors said in a press conference Tuesday that Simmons yelled something at Lynch. He then turned toward Simmons and Simmons shot him.\", \"\\\"There were numerous people in that parking lot when Officer Simmons saw Mr. Lynch starting to come up with the firearm,\\\" Virginia Beach Commonwealth's Attorney Colin Stolle said. \\\"So it is not only just whether the weapon was pointed at Officer Simmons. It was also \\u2014 are the people in the parking lot at risk?\\\"\", \"Multiple separate incidents of gunfire occurred near the parking lot and boardwalk before Lynch was shot, which caused Simmons to respond to the scene.\", \"Prosecutors showed footage of the time before and after Lynch was shot during the press conference from body cameras worn by officers at the scene and presented statements from witnesses.\", \"The grand jury decided Simmons' actions were justified because he was acting to protect himself and others in the area.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942870/virginia-beach-donovan-lynch-police-shooting-pharrell.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Scott Lang, Virginia Beach Chief Deputy Commonwealth Attorney, explains footage from police-worn body cameras during a press conference Tuesday in Virginia Beach, Va., about the police involved shooting of Donovan Lynch last March.</div>\", \"Lynch's father also filed a $50 million wrongful death lawsuit against Simmons and the city of Virginia Beach for allegedly failing to train its officers.\", \"Simmons never explicitly stated that Lynch pointed the gun directly at him, prosecutors said.\", \"Lynch, 25, of Virginia Beach, was an offensive lineman for the University of Virginia's College at Wise during the 2017 and 2018 seasons and a 2019 graduate of the school.\", \"Lynch and a friend were visiting the city's boardwalk, which is lined with restaurants and hotels, on a warm spring night that drew crowds of people.\", \"Prosecutors also presented a videotaped statement from Simmons, whose body camera had not been turned on during the shooting.\", \"Scott Lang, chief deputy commonwealth's attorney, said Simmons turned off his body camera because he began to drive to a hospital for an investigation involving a separate shooting victim. But then another shooting in which 50 rounds were fired in a parking lot broke out, Lang said.\", \"In a videotaped statement, Simmons said he saw Lynch, who \\\"seemed out of place.\\\" Simmons said Lynch had a gun and was crouched in the bushes next to the parking lot, where the shooting occurred.
