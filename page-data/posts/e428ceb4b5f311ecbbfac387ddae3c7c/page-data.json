\"The memo states: \\\"The MoH shared the following with us this week: in the last month we have distributed 50 million RATs into the system and so far less than 1 million results have been reported.\\\"\", \"The memo goes on to mention the increased number of false positives and negatives that occur with RATs (compared to PCRs) and the need to shift towards more PCR testing

middle of an Omicron outbreak, a switch back to PCR testing might not be feasible due to the sheer number of people who would need to be tested.\", \"\\\"And my concern is people have got so used to easy access to RATs and now they wouldn't want to wait in line.\\\"\", \"He said RATs are a tool to help slow down the spread of Omicron, but their accuracy can be as low as 50 percent.\", \"Auckland

results, they provide an insight into the spread and size of an outbreak.\", \"\\\"We are still undertaking some PCR testing. However, this is mainly focused on priority populations and those individuals who are at higher risk of the effects from Covid-19.\\\"\", \"According to the Ministry of Health, from 22 February to 4 April it has distributed 61.6 million RATs nationwide and between 13 December and 5 April, a total of 1,614,110 million results have been recorded.\", \"Local Democracy Reporting is a public interest news service supported by RNZ, the News Publishers' Association and NZ On Air.\"]","href_hash":"e428ceb4b5f311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e428ceb4b5f311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
