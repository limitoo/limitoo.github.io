In fact, it's already well underway.\", \"You have to feel some sympathy for Mr Morrison.\", \"With a revolving door of senior cabinet ministers calling it quits, scandals emerging by the day, defections on the floor of the House along with tensions between moderates and the right and the Liberals and the Nationals, he doesn't have a great deal to work with.\", \"Still, he's been in a tight spot before and pulled it off.\", \"This time around, given the lack of alternatives, he is almost certain to revert to the tried and trusty electioneering playbook, the mantra which for decades has helped the Coalition scrape across the line; superior economic management.\", \"It's a myth, of course. As an open, trade-based economy, we are at the whims of global forces.\", \"But it at least has proved the old maxim that the more often you say something, the more people believe it.\", \"Just last week, for instance, the damages bill for the extended lockdowns in NSW and Victoria was tallied.\", \"The economy contracted a whopping 1.9 per cent in the September quarter, the third worst performance in history, a result of catastrophic failures in quarantine compounded by a botched vaccine rollout that left the two biggest states with no alternative but to shut down.\", \"Luckily for the federal government, all the pain was concentrated in that one quarter.\", \"Had June registered a negative, even a tiny one, we would have been in recession for a second year running which would have thrown a wet blanket over the superior economic management argument.\", \"That's left Mr Morrison in the race.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How governments abandoned the economy\\u00a0</div>\", \"Governments across the developed world took a back seat when it came to running their economies back in the 1980s.\", \"They handed most of the difficult decisions to independent central banks, deregulated banking and financial systems, sold off vast chunks of state-owned assets and infrastructure, hollowed out the bureaucracy and allowed markets to price their currencies.\", \"In fact, they did everything they could to let the system run itself. The ethos was that government should step back to make way for free enterprise.\", \"They also took a sledgehammer to trade barriers. The end result was that China emerged as the world's factory, and its biggest export was low inflation.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b179e0ebc5c96efa09399b62b2a63a3f\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The ethos in the 1980s was that government should step back to make way for free enterprise.\\u00a0(Supplied)</div>\", \"Every conceivable product from shoes and shirts to heavy machinery and ships suddenly became cheaper, as they were produced en-masse.\", \"As a nation that embraced the new era of free trade and deregulation, we rode the wave of prosperity that flowed from China.\", \"All that industry had to be fuelled with raw materials and we were in the sweet spot in the early years of the new millennium.\", \"Year after year, the Howard government delivered budget surpluses fuelled by ever greater windfalls from iron ore and coal, wiped out our national debt and presided over a low inflation economy.\", \"But that all changed in 2008. The excesses and tensions from all those years of deregulation and financial innovation built to an unexpected crescendo, resulting in a near catastrophic collapse of the global banking system.\", \"The Rudd and Gillard governments were forced to inject cash into the economy, as this graph from the budget papers illustrate.\", \"But the biggest problem was not spending. It was revenue. As the economy dived, corporate tax, income tax and consumption tax receipts plummeted.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Australian government debt \\u2014 foreign and domestic\\u00a0</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/713f8dbcfad880fbd7ea98fab05fa5e6\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"Those deficits had to be financed with debt.\", \"Despite all the promises of the incoming Abbott government in 2013, the deficits continued.\", \"The superior economic management skills which, as former Treasurer Joe Hockey claimed, were in the party's DNA, failed to quell the funding shortfalls. And the debt kept rising.\", \"By the time bushfires razed the east coast in 2019, Australia's national debt had more than doubled under the Coalition. In the aftermath of the COVID pandemic, it has more than trebled.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Different crises, similar response\\u00a0</div>\", \"The bill from the Rudd and Gillard government GFC bailouts, delivered in three separate programs, amounted to $52 billion.\", \"The Coalition, then in opposition, launched a scathing attack on the spending programs, particularly the home insulation and school refurbishment programs, accusing the then Labor government of being wasteful and negligent.\", \"When the first wave of the pandemic hit Australia in February last year, however, the Coalition government had no choice but to embark upon the very same strategy.\", \"The rhetoric about a debt disaster finally was discarded and the nation was assured our debt situation was, in fact, conservative compared to most other nations.\", \"In this year's budget papers, the government estimated its COVID response would cost $311 billion including its health and economic response, with the biggest component the $90 billion Jobkeeper scheme.\", \"It too has come under fire,\\u00a0given $38 billion of taxpayer funds was handed to businesses that lifted revenue and profits during the lockdowns.\", \"But, like Labor's GFC response, the ultimate aim was to keep the economy ticking over and minimise the long term damage. Once again, the loss of tax revenue from the economic plunge ravaged the national accounts.\", \"As former Finance Minister Matthias Cormann was forced to admit last year: \\\"In the circumstances, what was the alternative?\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Superior management or just good luck?\\u00a0</div>\", \"While the projections from this year's budget have been thrown wildly out by the most recent lockdowns, the Prime Minister has one handy piece of ammunition up his sleeve for the upcoming election.\", \"With vaccination rates now among the best in the developed world, spending is likely to swiftly recover in the lead up to Christmas, generating a huge bounce in growth.\", \"The extended lockdowns in the eastern states have helped create a huge well of savings and pent-up demand.\", \"With nowhere to go, and government stimulus still swirling through the system, household savings have jumped from 12 per cent to almost 20 per cent.\", \"With the economy now much smaller than previously predicted, that spending spurt will drive momentum off a much lower base, giving the appearance of turbocharged growth.\", \"That prospect of better times ahead just might be enough for the electorate to forget the shortcomings of the past.\", \"But challenges and risks remain and not just from new variants of the virus such as Omicron.\", \"Global inflation has been more persistent than first thought, and market interest rates have moved well ahead of central banks.\", \"Rates on domestic money markets have doubled since January this year and that already is beginning to feed into lending.\", \"Then there's China, which is experiencing serious economic pain.\", \"While the Treasurer Josh Frydenberg maintained ultra conservative estimates for commodity prices, and particularly iron ore and coal, in the most recent budget, the expected bonanza from record prices on both commodities just a few months ago suddenly has evaporated.\", \"Iron ore has crashed from record highs of $US230 a tonne to around $US100 a tonne.\", \"While that still is well above the $US55 a tonne forecast for March next year, the pace of the decline will wipe significant amounts from tax revenues.\", \"That wouldn't be a good look in a pre-election budget. And it might just highlight that, rather than management skills, it is luck, or at least forces beyond any government's control, that determine the fortunes of a small highly trade exposed nation like ours.\"]","href_hash":"d000b09e561411ecbea683bad208f7c6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d000b09e561411ecbea683bad208f7c6"}},
