The demonstrators\\u2019 anger was particularly trained on the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a notoriously corrupt police unit.\", \"The panel\\u2019s report, which was submitted to Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, was leaked to the news media on Monday and a copy was obtained by The New York Times. It listed 48 people as shooting victims.\", \"The job of the panel, headed by Doris Okuwobi, a retired judge, was to put to rest the controversy as to whether what transpired on the night of Oct. 20 qualified as a \\u201cmassacre.\\u201d\", \"The army had maintained that it fired blanks to disperse protesters. But the judicial panel reported evidence that soldiers \\u201cactually shot blank and live bullets directly and pointedly into the midst of protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate, with the deliberate intention to assault, maim, and kill.\\u201d It also noted that the soldiers turned back ambulances that arrived to help wounded protesters.\", \"The panel found the army\\u2019s response unwarranted, saying that \\u201cthe mayhem and violence recorded in other parts of Lagos State did not happen at the Lekki Toll Gate, so there was no need for any apprehension on the part of the government or the security agencies to seek to dispel that peaceful assembly, with soldiers bearing lethal weapons.\\u201d\", \"When the panel convened last year, a representative of the Nigerian Army, Brig. Gen. A.I. Taiwo, insisted that the troops at the tollgate \\u201cstrictly followed\\u201d the army\\u2019s rules of engagement for internal security. He said the army used nonviolent means to bring the situation under control.\", \"But the panel concluded that since the deployment of the army was not justified, the question of whether troops adhered to any rule of engagement was immaterial. It also noted that General Taiwo\\u2019s evidence was \\u201chearsay\\u201d since he was not present at the time of the incident. The general claimed he monitored the events \\u201con the internet.\\u201d\", \"After a few appearances before the panel, the army stopped cooperating with its inquiry.\", \"Though the Nigerian government and several pro-government activists had maintained that no massacre occurred, some social media users, including the Nigerian songwriter and musician, Obianuju Catherine Udeh, who goes by DJ Switch, live-streamed the demonstration. People, scared and scarred, in the video could be heard screaming \\u201cthey are shooting\\u201d as they ran in different directions seeking cover.\", \"On the first anniversary of the protest, last month, Nigeria\\u2019s Information and Culture Minister, Lai Mohammed, demanded an apology from the trio of Amnesty International, CNN, and DJ Switch \\u201cfor misleading the world.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe military did not shoot at protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on Oct. 20, 2020, and there was no massacre at the toll gate,\\u201d Mr. Mohammed told journalists during a news conference in Abuja, Nigeria\\u2019s capital. \\u201cThe only massacre recorded was in the social media.\\u201d\", \"The panel\\u2019s report, however, stated that several protesters were hit by bullets when the army started shooting and when the police returned, hours later, to disperse what was left of the gathering.\", \"\\u201cEvidence from the Forensics experts (Sentinel Forensics Ltd) engaged by the panel confirmed that multiple muzzle flashes consistent with the discharge of ammunition were observed,\\u201d stated the report.\", \"\\u201cFrom the totality of the evidence adduced, it can be safely concluded that there were the use and discharge of live ammunitions at the Lekki Toll Gate on 20th October, 2020 which resulted in injuries and deaths.\\u201d\", \"In the aftermath of the protest, DJ Switch was attacked by government supporters, who accused her of spreading lies about the protest.\", \"On Monday night, after the panel\\u2019s report was leaked, she wrote on Twitter: \\u201cShattered so many lives, tried to destroy mine.
