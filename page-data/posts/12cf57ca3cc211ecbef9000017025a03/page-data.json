Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, ran close to expected totals in the state\\u2019s majority-Black areas. Instead, Black state leaders and voters who backed Mr. McAuliffe said the results were a sign that the party could not rely on minority voters to cover its cratering totals in more white areas of the state, particularly in rural communities that voted heavily for Glenn Youngkin, the Republican businessman who won the governor\\u2019s race.\", \"\\u201cI believe that Black voters are easily the first target for when things don\\u2019t go for how they want it to go,\\u201d said Marcia Price, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates who won re-election.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a trash take to look at us and not the middle,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThe middle said Youngkin is more palatable than Trump and they were willing to take a chance with him.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Price\\u2019s words reflect a sense among the state\\u2019s Black political class that communities of color are often blamed when Democrats lose.\", \"At the grass-roots level, voters in Newport News also said that their support for Mr. McAuliffe did not mean they were satisfied with the performance of Democrats in Washington.\", \"Several voters cited a radio advertisement that had been playing on local stations saying Black voters should not back Mr. McAuliffe because Democrats cared about Black communities only during election season. They rejected the ad\\u2019s plea to stay home but said the general theme resonated, and they urged Democrats in Congress to pass bold legislation on President Biden\\u2019s core campaign promises, including climate change, police reform and economic investments in Black communities.\", \"\\u201cA lot of people are upset with Biden,\\u201d said William Joyner, a 54-year-old Democrat. \\u201cWe have high gas prices. Everything is so expensive right now.\\u201d\", \"He added, \\u201cBiden made promises to Black people he hasn\\u2019t kept yet.\\u201d\", \"Tony McCright, 68, who also voted for Mr. McAuliffe, said there was a sense among Black voters that they were voting for Democrats only out of necessity.\", \"\\u201cRepublicans are happy to come together to do the wrong thing,\\u201d Mr. McCright said, \\u201cbut Democrats never come together to do the right thing.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"12cf57ca3cc211ecbef9000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"12cf57ca3cc211ecbef9000017025a03"}},
