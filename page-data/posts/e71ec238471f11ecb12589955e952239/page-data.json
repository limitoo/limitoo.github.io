But \\u201cwoke,\\u201d which has a longer etymological history, has only become increasingly common in recent years. What was once a popular adjective among left-leaning social media cognoscenti as part of the colloquial admonition to \\u201cstay woke\\u201d to various forms of systemic racism first morphed into a general shorthand denoting today\\u2019s left-leaning orthodoxy and then a slur that underscored the overweening, obsessive nature of said orthodoxy.\", \"Last week, the Times columnist Bret Stephens argued that wokeness has been \\u201cclobbered\\u201d politically. That came on the heels of the Times columnist Maureen Dowd arguing that wokeness \\u201cderails\\u201d the Democratic Party. In the aftermath of Democrats\\u2019 loss in the recent Virginia governor\\u2019s race, the veteran Democratic consultant James Carville identified \\u201cstupid wokeness\\u201d as the proximate cause. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, herself an avatar of wokeness, tweet-dismissed that assessment by saying \\u201cthe average audience for people seriously using the word \\u2018woke\\u2019 in a 2021 political discussion are James Carville and Fox News pundits so that should tell you all you need to know.\\u201d A couple of days later, she tweeted: \\u201c\\u2018Woke\\u2019 is a term pundits are now using as a derogatory euphemism for civil rights & justice.\\u201d\", \"Having arrived, then, at an intramural Democratic skirmish over the meaning of \\u201cwoke\\u201d \\u2014 and how much blame it should be assigned for the party\\u2019s woes \\u2014 there should be little doubt remaining that progressives have lost this latest terminological battle. \\u201cWoke\\u201d is broke. The question is what will replace it.\", \"As I wrote back in August, \\u201cstay woke,\\u201d an expression that migrated from Black vernacular to mainstream use, went from being insider progressive-speak to a term of derision for a progressive agenda. At its best, it was deployed as a catchphrase \\u2014 often in hashtag form \\u2014 to urge others to stay focused. At its worst, as I argued in 2016, it allowed many progressives, supposedly attuned to injustice, to signal their commitment to combating it without actually demonstrating an understanding of its causes or remedies.\", \"\\u201cWoke\\u201d has also followed a trajectory similar to that of the phrase \\u201cpolitically correct,\\u201d which carried a similar meaning by the late 1980s and early 1990s: \\u201cPolitically correct,\\u201d unsurprisingly, went from describing a way of seeing the world to describing the people who saw the world that way to describing the way other people felt about the people who saw the world that way. Some in the politically correct crowd on the left had a way of treating those outside it with a certain contempt. This led to the right refashioning \\u201cpolitically correct\\u201d as a term of derision, regularly indicated with the tart abbreviation \\u201cP.C.\\u201d The term faded over the years, and by 2015, when the presidential candidate Donald Trump was declaring that \\u201cpolitical correctness is just absolutely killing us as a country,\\u201d \\u201cwoke\\u201d already had greater currency.\", \"Over the past few years, it has become all but impossible to use \\u201cwoke\\u201d neutrally. It has been refashioned, like \\u201cP.C.,\\u201d as an insult. One could say that this was simply because of contempt for leftist ideas, even ones relating to improving lives for Black people, but only at risk of oversimplification. Wokeness, as a kind of ideology, has irritated so many because of the tendency for some of its partisans to see those who dissent from their views as disingenuous, antidemocratic and even immoral. To be woke, past tense, is to be awake, present tense, to a way of perceiving societal matters. But it\\u2019s a short step from seeing matters this way to assuming that it is the only reasonable or moral way to see. That latter assumption has a way of rankling those who see things differently.\", \"Now, those on the left, from Ocasio-Cortez on down, face a new iteration of an old dilemma: A neutral descriptor of their worldview saddled with a negative connotation.\", \"It\\u2019s easy to forget how antique, or at least vague, \\u201cliberal\\u201d feels lately. Much of the reason is that the term was tarnished by the right almost as much as woke has been. In an era spanning, let\\u2019s say, Ronald Reagan\\u2019s presidency, Newt Gingrich\\u2019s House speakership and Al Gore\\u2019s loss to George W. Bush, those who thought of themselves as liberals in commitment to nudging America toward ever broader embodiments of its ideals, especially those involving the dignity of all individuals, were tarred as unpatriotic sentimentalists dedicated to big government and with insufficient interest in family values.\", \"Writing for The Times in 2009, Timothy Garton Ash hoped we might reclaim the classical meaning of the lowercase-L liberalism we learn about in college, espousing grand but abstract ideas such as \\u201cliberty under law, limited and accountable government, markets, tolerance, some version of individualism and universalism and some notion of human equality, reason and progress.\\u201d After all, who could possibly be against any of that?\", \"But it didn\\u2019t happen. Intellectual constructs such as those aren\\u2019t exactly what gets most people to the polls, and conservatives sneering endlessly about capital-L liberals discouraged any consideration of more approachable uses of the term. Rather, when Hillary Clinton was asked in a 2007 Democratic primary debate whether she called herself a liberal \\u2014 the rough equivalent of asking Ocasio-Cortez today whether she would call herself woke \\u2014 Clinton replied, \\u201cI consider myself a proud modern American progressive.\\u201d\", \"And even if Clinton might more accurately be described as a mainstream Democrat, these days it would seem that \\u201cprogressive\\u201d will have to suffice to suggest left-leaning enlightenment without the overlay of snark.\", \"That may feel unsatisfactory to progressives, even after acknowledging that \\u201cprogressive\\u201d doesn\\u2019t lend itself as easily to rebuke because, among other things, it\\u2019s the antonym of \\u201cconservative.\\u201d To \\u201cstay woke\\u201d certainly feels punchier than \\u201cstaying progressive,\\u201d in carrying an air of commitment to race issues in particular. Also, apart from explicit commitment to race, American culture, despite the racist biases in its fabric, includes a tacit sense that Blackness, and the Black lexicon, carries cultural weight or authenticity. \\u201cWoke\\u201d felt real, grounded \\u2014 awake \\u2014 in a way that the Latinate \\u201cprogressive\\u201d and \\u201cliberal\\u201d never could.\", \"Perhaps Black English will yield a new neutral term for wokeness. Two outcomes would be likely. One is that if it goes mainstream, some will object that the crossover is a form of cultural appropriation. The other is that sooner rather than later, that new term would come to be processed as a slur for the same reasons that \\u201cP.C.,\\u201d \\u201cliberal\\u201d and \\u201cwoke\\u201d were.\", \"So here\\u2019s another modest proposal: Progressives inclined to tar people for their perceived complicity in an assortment of injustices \\u2014 for having insufficiently woke views \\u2014 might temper their fervor. If they could manage that, a new equivalent to \\u201cwoke\\u201d as a mere descriptor, with the positive-to-neutral connotation it had not so long ago, might last a little longer.\", \"Pour one out for the old \\u201cwoke.\\u201d It was fun while it lasted.\"]","href_hash":"e71ec238471f11ecb12589955e952239"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e71ec238471f11ecb12589955e952239"}},
