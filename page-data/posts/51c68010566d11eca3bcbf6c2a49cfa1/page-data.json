She was his \\u201cNo. 2,\\u201d he said.\", \"Later, when one of Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers cross-examined Mr. Visoski, the questioning zeroed in on the specifics of the relationship between Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. It \\u201cwasn\\u2019t totally clear\\u201d if they were ever in a romantic relationship, Mr. Visoski acknowledged. He had never seen them kiss or hold hands, he said. At one point he described Ms. Maxwell as merely \\u201cone of the assistants\\u201d in Mr. Epstein\\u2019s office.\", \"It was the first of several moments of testimony during the first week of Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s federal trial in Manhattan that underlined how the trial may hinge at least in part on the precise nature of her partnership with Mr. Epstein, whose shadow looms over the case even in death.\", \"Beginning with opening statements and the questioning of witnesses, the crux of the case has become clear: Were Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein partners, or partners in crime?\", \"The first week of testimony showed prosecutors are trying to convince the jury that Ms. Maxwell was not only Mr. Epstein\\u2019s household manager and key employee but also his close associate who had unique access to his private life. And the defense has sought to divorce Ms. Maxwell from Mr. Epstein\\u2019s infamy, arguing that her presence in his life does not make her complicit.\", \"Ms. Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to charges that she recruited, groomed and ultimately helped Mr. Epstein abuse young girls. He was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges when he died in a Manhattan jail cell.\", \"Prosecutors have repeatedly tried to place Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein together, describing her as his \\u201cright hand,\\u201d and saying she was involved in \\u201cevery detail of Epstein\\u2019s life.\\u201d They said she imposed strict rules for the staff and enforced a \\u201cculture of silence,\\u201d which allowed their abuse of minors to remain hidden.\", \"The government has suggested that their long, close relationship makes her culpable, even where she might not have been present for abuse that they say he carried out.\", \"Ms. Maxwell \\u201cwalked the girls into a room where she knew that man would molest them,\\u201d a prosecutor, Lara Pomerantz, said in the government\\u2019s opening statement. \\u201cShe knew what was going to happen to those girls.\\u201d\", \"But Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers, wherever possible, have sought to disassociate their client from Mr. Epstein, saying the two were often apart \\u2014 keeping their own homes and traveling separately \\u2014 and that Mr. Epstein spent time with other women.\", \"Mr. Epstein \\u201ccompartmentalized his life,\\u201d Bobbi C. Sternheim, one of Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers, told the jury in an opening statement on Monday, \\u201cshowing only what he wanted to show to the people around him, including Ghislaine.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Sternheim suggested Ms. Maxwell was only on trial because of her association with Mr. Epstein. \\u201cShe is a scapegoat for a man who behaved badly,\\u201d she said.\", \"The opposing visions of the relationship at the center of the case became clear quickly last Monday, the trial's first day, when the prosecution called one of Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s accusers, a woman identified only as Jane, to the witness stand.\", \"She offered vivid testimony about how, at the age of 14 in 1994, she was eating ice cream with friends at a summer arts camp in Michigan when a \\u201ctall, thin woman\\u201d approached her with a \\u201ccute little Yorkie.\\u201d\", \"Jane said the woman \\u2014 Ms. Maxwell \\u2014 was joined \\u201ca minute later\\u201d by a man who introduced himself as Mr. Epstein and talked with her about her interests. That brief encounter, Jane said, led to an invitation to Mr. Epstein\\u2019s Palm Beach home for tea. That, in turn, led to regular visits with him and Ms. Maxwell, which soon gave way to her being sexually abused by both.\", \"But during cross-examination, Laura Menninger, another defense lawyer, focused on what she suggested was evidence that Jane\\u2019s account of Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s involvement in the abuse had shifted and expanded in recent years.\", \"Citing Jane\\u2019s first meeting with the government in September 2019, Ms. Menninger said an F.B.I. agent\\u2019s notes showed she had given a different version of the summer camp encounter, in which Mr. Epstein, not Ms. Maxwell, had first approached the table.\", \"\\u201cWhat you told the government,\\u201d Ms. Menninger said, \\u201cis that Ghislaine walked by with her dog, and Jeffrey Epstein came up to meet you, correct?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t have said that,\\u201d Jane said.\", \"Had the F.B.I. had made a mistake in the note taking? Ms. Menninger asked.\", \"\\u201cMaybe they typed it up wrong,\\u201d Jane said.\", \"After Ms. Menninger confronted Jane with other inconsistencies between what she earlier told investigators and her trial testimony, Jane replied, \\u201cMemory is not linear.\\u201d\", \"In another example of each side\\u2019s contrasting approach in the trial, prosecutors introduced testimony and evidence of a set of strict rules governing Mr. Epstein\\u2019s households: nondisclosure agreements for employees, even a 58-page \\u201cHousehold Manual\\u201d for staff, instructing them not to make eye contact with Mr. Epstein and mandating they \\u201cNEVER disclose Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s activities or whereabouts to anyone\\u201d unless otherwise instructed.\", \"The prosecution has made it clear that Ms. Maxwell was a driving force behind these rules.\", \"\\u201cThat was by design, the defendant\\u2019s design,\\u201d Ms. Pomerantz told the jury, \\u201cbecause behind closed doors, the defendant and Epstein were committing heinous crimes. They were sexually abusing teenage girls.\\u201d\", \"In the hands of Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers, though, these measures were the sensible precautions of a wealthy man who entertained powerful people, and who kept aspects of his life extremely private \\u2014 including from Ms. Maxwell.\", \"\\u201cHe kept parts of his life locked from others,\\u201d Ms. Sternheim told the jury.\", \"The defense, in cross-examination of the pilot, Mr. Visoski, elicited testimony that nondisclosure agreements were common in his line of work, especially when dealing with \\u201chigh-profile people.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a fairly normal request,\\u201d Mr. Visoski said, adding that he had never seen illegal activity onboard Mr. Epstein\\u2019s plane.\", \"And as Mr. Epstein\\u2019s property manager, the defense suggested, Ms. Maxwell naturally had a role in enforcing the household rules, as well as supervising construction on Mr. Epstein\\u2019s private island, managing cleaning and repairs and taking care of the horses and other animals on his Santa Fe ranch.\", \"Each side\\u2019s differing approach has also surfaced in debates held outside the jury\\u2019s presence.\", \"In one such episode on Friday morning, the parties skirmished over whether prosecutors could show the jury a suggestive photograph that appeared briefly in a video of a 2005 law enforcement search of Mr. Epstein\\u2019s Palm Beach house, which the government wanted to play for the jury.\", \"The image depicts \\u201ca sexualized photograph of a clearly underage female\\u201d lying in Mr. Epstein\\u2019s lap, a prosecutor, Maurene Comey, told the judge. She said the photograph hung by the entrance to Mr. Epstein\\u2019s bedroom \\u2014 a bedroom Ms. Maxwell almost always shared with him when they were at that residence, another former employee testified last week.\", \"Mr. Everdell argued that the image should be redacted on grounds it was prejudicial, particularly given there were no allegations Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell were involved with prepubescent girls.\", \"But Ms. Comey said the photo countered the defense\\u2019s depiction of Mr. Epstein as an \\u201cupstanding citizen who was surrounded by presidents and all sorts of important prominent people.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Comey said she believed Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers were \\u201csetting up an argument\\u201d that Ms. Maxwell could not have possibly known Mr. Epstein was attracted to young girls because someone who spent so much time with such luminaries \\u201ccouldn\\u2019t possibly have such a vile attraction.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis photograph is directly contradicting that argument,\\u201d Ms. Comey said, suggesting that the photograph and its location said as much about Ms. Maxwell as it did about Mr. Epstein.\", \"The judge, Alison J. Nathan, agreed to let the jury see the image of the photograph in the video, saying, \\u201cI think the context is different than the photo in isolation.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"51c68010566d11eca3bcbf6c2a49cfa1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"51c68010566d11eca3bcbf6c2a49cfa1"}},
