At times he appears with his back turned to us, or with a green apple floating in the air in front of his face, concealing more than he reveals.\", \"Magritte did not intend the image as a self-portrait, although it does physically resemble the artist, a sober presence who wore a suit and slippers when he painted and eschewed bohemian adventure. As we learn in Alex Danchev\\u2019s \\u201cMagritte: A Life,\\u201d the first full-length biography of him, the Belgian Surrealist disliked travel and had little patience for the French Surrealists gathered in the cafes of Paris, loudly proclaiming their desire to remake art as a lawless realm modeled on dreams and the subconscious. For most of his adulthood, Magritte resided on the outskirts of Brussels, living quietly with his wife, Georgette, and their dog. Friends recounted that he never had a proper studio. He set up his easel in a corner of his dining room and left no paint stains on the floor.\", \"He was, in other words, the embodiment of Flaubert\\u2019s famous dictum that artists should live in an orderly fashion and reserve their wildness for their work. His art was brilliantly subversive and based on his belief that everyday life is shrouded in mystery. The steam locomotive jutting out of a marble fireplace and into a spotless living room; the streetlamp glowing on a dark boulevard, beneath a noon-bright blue sky; the painting of a wooden pipe that comes with an inscription insisting, \\u201cThis is not a pipe,\\u201d presumably because it\\u2019s a painting and cannot be smoked or stuffed with tobacco \\u2014 he created visual enigmas that feel almost as sharp and accessible as our personal memories.\", \"His painting style was deliberately generic. In the century that exalted abstraction as new and radical, Magritte favored a crisp, hyper-lucid brand of figuration that betrayed no trace of his individual brush strokes. The idea that an artist should have his own \\u201ctouch\\u201d struck him as grandiose and laughable. He paid a price for his mulish views. Some critics felt he was essentially an illustrator, and he failed to command the prestige that was lavished on Surrealism\\u2019s more experimental and improvisatory figures, such as Joan Mir\\u00f3 or Alberto Giacometti.\", \"As Danchev reports in his biography, Magritte was seldom free of financial worries, scrimping until the last decade of his life. If only we knew more! Danchev, a British historian and the author of a well-received biography of Paul C\\u00e9zanne, died suddenly in 2016, at the age of 60, before completing his latest book. Sarah Whitfield, a British art historian and co-author of the Magritte catalogue raisonn\\u00e9, supplied the final chapter. As a whole, the book is accessible, factually reliable and, at 439 pages, free of the inflated heft of so many recent biographies.\", \"Magritte\\u2019s vision was almost inseparable from a tragedy that occurred in his childhood. Born in the small town of Lessines in 1898, the oldest son of a tailor, he grew up in a middle-class home and started drawing as a child. On a winter night in 1912, as he and his two younger brothers slept, their mother walked out of her bedroom and down to the river Sambre and committed suicide by drowning. Eighteen days passed before her body was retrieved from the river.\", \"The story goes that when she was found, her face was covered by her wet nightgown and her torso was exposed. This gruesome detail was later cited as a source for the profusion of veiled heads in Magritte\\u2019s work, as in his much-reproduced \\u201cThe Lovers II\\u201d (1928), an icon of romantic frustration. It depicts a cinematic-style close-up of a man and a woman kissing, their lips never touching, their heads swathed in white cloth.\", \"Magritte declined to talk about his mother\\u2019s death, even privately, and dismissed psychology as a pseudoscience. Danchev does not say much about the subject, except that \\u201cit is highly unlikely that he was present at the very moment his mother was fished out of the swirling currents.\\u201d Even so, it seems fair to say that his mother\\u2019s death and the years of depression that preceded it surely bear a connection to the all-around sense of apprehension pervading his work.\", \"Danchev is on firmer ground in describing Magritte\\u2019s career. For a while he eked out a living in commercial art, drawing designs for wallpaper. He painted on the side, in an abstract, nominally Cubist style. An awakening came in 1923, when he saw a reproduction of Giorgio de Chirico\\u2019s masterpiece, \\u201cThe Song of Love\\u201d (1914), which had an instant hold on him. Consisting of an assortment of poetically mismatched objects (a looming plaster head of a Greek god, a rubber glove nailed to a wall, a green ball), it alerted Magritte to the possibility of a new kind of representational painting, one in which fragmentation and isolation reign.\", \"In September 1927, Magritte moved to Paris to acquaint himself with the French Surrealist group. Under their influence, he turned out his most original work, including his so-called \\u201cword paintings,\\u201d such as the pipe that is not a pipe. (Amazing what a breath of Paris air used to do.) Yet Magritte remained an awkward interloper among the Surrealists. Andr\\u00e9 Breton, the imperious poet who served as the movement\\u2019s leader, purchased a few of Magritte\\u2019s works for his own collection, but derided him as a clod who spoke French with a Walloon accent. Breton barely mentioned him in his extensive writings.\", \"Danchev recounts an altercation that occurred in 1929, during a small party at Breton\\u2019s home. Flaunting his contempt for Catholicism, Breton asked Georgette Magritte why she was wearing a cross. He suggested she remove it. She and Magritte left the party in a huff and soon after departed Paris altogether.\", \"\\u201cIt could be said that Magritte\\u2019s artistic biography ended when he left Paris in 1930,\\u201d the critic Suzi Gablik wrote in her eloquent monograph on the artist, the first book on him published in English (in 1970). Gablik, a native New Yorker, lived in Magritte\\u2019s attic for eight months starting in 1959 while researching her book, hinting at the fascination he commanded among a new generation of Americans.\", \"Surely Marcel Duchamp had something to do with Magritte\\u2019s new prominence in the States. Duchamp, the influential Dadaist, a self-proclaimed ex-Frenchman and ex-painter then residing in Greenwich Village, appreciated Magritte\\u2019s philosophical bent and pointed collectors in his direction. Magritte was also admired by various younger artists who were exploring the pathos of commonplace objects, including Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol, all of whom acquired works by Magritte in the early \\u201960s.\", \"In 1965, honored with a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, Magritte flew to New York for the opening. He was accompanied by his wife and their pet dog, Loulou, a fluffy Pomeranian. During his stay, he was introduced to key artists and critics, but Magritte spoke no English and appeared uninterested in the people he met. He no more endeared himself to the New York avant-garde of the \\u201960s than he had to the French avant-garde of the \\u201920s.\", \"He died just two years later \\u2014 in 1967, of pancreatic cancer, at age 69. In the decades since, his reputation has grown exponentially, and his images have been reverently absorbed into high culture and popular culture alike. He is probably the only artist who appeals at once to postmodernists obsessed with the failures of language and rock \\u2019n\\u2019 rollers enamored of hallucinatory visions. He himself would no doubt feign indifference to the news, but the rest of us have to be at least slightly impressed that Paul McCartney cited a Magritte painting of a green apple as the source of the name of the Beatles\\u2019 Apple Corps.\"]","href_hash":"7a1d569a529111ec81de372dbf136874"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7a1d569a529111ec81de372dbf136874"}},
