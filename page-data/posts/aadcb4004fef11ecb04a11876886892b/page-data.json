Comparisons to Shakespeare were invoked more than once; so was appreciation for his tough-love feedback to those who interpreted his songs.\", \"Because the Pulitzer-Prize-winning composer of such beloved shows as \\u201cSunday in the Park With George\\u201d and \\u201cSweeney Todd\\u201d was known for his wit and wordplay, writers who stick to the page, not the stage, weighed in with admiration as well. (The pop tunesmith Jack Antonoff did, too.) And, given how often Sondheim songs traded in wistfulness and melancholy, the composer\\u2019s own lyrics were used to celebrate and remember him, too. Here is a sampling of responses.\", \"I\\u2019m weirdly numb and super-emotional all at the same time. I can\\u2019t quite process what the world (especially the theatrical world) looks like without him. He was a giant, he was a genius, he was a legend, he was wickedly funny, he was wildly supportive but bluntly honest, and he was one of the wisest, toughest, most profound mentor/teachers I\\u2019ve ever known. I will miss him terribly. AUDRA McDONALD\", \"Even in a time so full of loss, this news feels like a unique punch to the heart. Which is appropriate, I guess, given that is exactly how his music always affected me. What do you say when the ocean goes away, or when a mountain disappears? Steve was that elemental and irreplaceable a part of my career and my understanding of art and life. And I\\u2019m surely not alone in that feeling. I don\\u2019t really have the words. Steve would. MICHAEL CERVERIS\", \"He was like Shakespeare, and what a privilege to be able to say, \\u201cSteve, what did you mean when you wrote that?\\u201d You could get it right from the horse\\u2019s mouth. I always say, he gave me so much to sing about. BERNADETTE PETERS\", \"Take a walk in the words and music that he left us. Walk in privacy, walk with a friend, put it on at different times in your life. Listen to it, sometimes listen more than once because the simplicity with which he expresses the most complicated human emotions \\u2014 he\\u2019s able to do it in a way that once you hear it, it\\u2019s unforgettable. He was simply one of our greatest teachers. MANDY PATINKIN\", \"How I cherished his ambivalences! Once, after the final dress rehearsal for \\u201cDo I Hear a Waltz?\\u201d Sondheim stood in front of the entire company and crew. He suddenly noticed me, and I said \\u201cHello!\\u201d and he burst out, \\u201cOh, hello! You were wonderful, most of the time.\\u201d That comma, that breadth of affirmation and doubt, is what makes him so astounding, and so wonderful to sing \\u2014 most of the time. No, all of the time. MELISSA ERRICO\", \"There is no way to overestimate Steve\\u2019s impact on my life and work. He was like my second father. I honestly can\\u2019t imagine a life without him in it. LONNY PRICE\", \"The theater has lost one of its greatest geniuses and the world has lost one of its greatest and most original writers. Sadly, there is now a giant in the sky. CAMERON MACKINTOSH\"]","href_hash":"aadcb4004fef11ecb04a11876886892b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"aadcb4004fef11ecb04a11876886892b"}},
