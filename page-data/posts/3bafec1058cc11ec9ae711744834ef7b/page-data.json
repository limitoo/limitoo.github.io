Nathan will ask Ms. Maxwell, who has been charged with recruiting, grooming and ultimately helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse underage girls, if she wants to take the witness stand to tell her side of the story.\", \"Defense lawyers generally advise clients against testifying in their own trial, but the decision is ultimately a defendant\\u2019s, and it could be pivotal in her case.\", \"\\u201cI think she would do more harm than good,\\u201d said Mark D. Richards, the veteran lawyer who represented Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted of two fatal shootings amid protests over police conduct in Kenosha, Wis., last year. At his trial last month, Mr. Rittenhouse testified in his own defense.\", \"Mr. Richards said that if Ms. Maxwell decided to testify, prosecutors could confront her directly with evidence of her ties to Mr. Epstein, who died in jail two years ago while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019s trying to separate herself from Epstein,\\u201d Mr. Richards said. \\u201cAt least now, you can blame it on a dead guy.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s attorneys have not publicly detailed their defense, but they have suggested in court filings that they wanted to present experts to rebut the opinions of a government witness, a clinical and forensic psychologist, who testified about grooming, a strategy predators use to try to break down a potential victim\\u2019s resistance to abusive conduct.\", \"Recently, defendants have decided to take the witness stand in several high-profile cases.\", \"One of the three men convicted in Brunswick, Ga., last month of murder and other charges in the fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery took the witness stand during the trial. And in a fraud trial in San Jose, Calif., Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the failed blood testing start-up Theranos, finished seven days of testimony in her own defense on Wednesday. She has pleaded not guilty.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s cases where you will do everything humanly possible to keep your client off because you know he\\u2019s going to hurt him or herself,\\u201d Mr. Richards said. \\u201cAnd there\\u2019s other cases where you just know that it\\u2019s going to be needed and you do everything you can to prepare the person and get them ready.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to the charges against her, and at a pretrial hearing, she told the judge, \\u201cI have not committed any crime.\\u201d\", \"In court, she seems attentive and even animated while seated beside her lawyers. She speaks with them before the jury arrives; she peers at a screen in front of her when photographs are displayed to the jurors; and she sometimes scribbles in a notebook, occasionally passing a Post-it note to her attorneys.\", \"Defendants have the right not to testify in a trial \\u2014 the burden of proof is solely the government's \\u2014 and jurors are instructed not to draw any conclusions from that choice.\", \"And where the decision is seen as a close one, a defense attorney\\u2019s choice not to have a client testify may reflect the view that the government\\u2019s case is weak and can be overcome through a strong summation or other defense witnesses, legal experts said.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s going to come down to the defense\\u2019s assessment of how strong the government\\u2019s case came in and whether it\\u2019s worth taking the risk,\\u201d said Jessica A. Roth, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan who teaches law at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.\", \"She said the defense\\u2019s best strategy may be to remind the jurors of the government\\u2019s burden of proof, without trying to present an alternative narrative through Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s testimony.\", \"\\u201cThe jury may be wondering what it is that Maxwell thought was happening behind closed doors,\\u201d Professor Roth said. \\u201cAnd they\\u2019ll be told that they can\\u2019t demand her explanation.\\u201d\", \"Ultimately, though, Ms. Maxwell could overrule her lawyers and decide to testify, said Stephen Gillers, a professor of legal ethics at New York University School of Law.\", \"\\u201cDefendants rarely do,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbut some have an exaggerated sense of their ability to handle aggressive government questioning.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Richards questioned whether Ms. Maxwell, a former socialite who is the daughter of a onetime British media mogul, could endure a grueling cross-examination by a prosecutor.\", \"\\u201cWhat I\\u2019ve read about her,\\u201d he said, \\u201cshe\\u2019s very upper class, kind of cultured. And if she were to take the witness stand and be questioned by someone who she does not think is her equal, she might have a lot of trouble with that.\\u201d\", \"Moira Penza, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn who led the prosecution team that won the 2019 racketeering conviction of Keith Raniere, the Nxivm sex cult leader, noted that defendants who testify essentially give up their right not to incriminate themselves.\", \"On cross-examination, she said, \\u201cprosecutors have a lot of room to really retry their case through the defendant, to bring up again all of their best evidence, and beyond that, to attack the credibility of the witness in any way they can.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Maxwell also faces two perjury charges \\u2014 not part of her current trial \\u2014 in which she has been accused of lying under oath during 2016 depositions she gave in a lawsuit related to Mr. Epstein.\", \"Professor Roth said those statements could be the subject of cross-examination if prosecutors believe they can show that Ms. Maxwell was lying, undermining her credibility before the jury.\", \"Benjamin Brafman, a prominent defense lawyer in New York, said that Rule No. 1 when a defendant is considering whether or not to testify is not to lie.\", \"\\u201cIf you lie and a jury believes that you were lying, then all of the reasonable doubts that your lawyers may have created through effective cross-examination, I think, may be nullified,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Brafman said the last client he put on the witness stand was Sean Combs, the rap star and producer, who was acquitted of all charges in a gun possession and bribery trial some two decades ago.\", \"As for Ms. Maxwell, he said: \\u201cI would be stunned if she were to take the stand.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3bafec1058cc11ec9ae711744834ef7b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3bafec1058cc11ec9ae711744834ef7b"}},
