The arrest came after a Telegram chat group showed him making remarks defending his father. He also previously shared posts criticizing current Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.\", \"Authorities previously said that Sovannchhay would be released on November 8. However, they later told his mother, Prum Chantha, that his release was delayed.\", \"\\\"My son would have been feeling so excited when hearing he would be freed today and knowing that I was here with the others to welcome him, but now they're keeping him in jail for two more days,\\\" she told reporters. \\\"Why would the court keep him in jail?\\\"\", \"Sovannchhay's autism has also been a contentious factor in the case. The Phnom Penh Municipal Court claims that medical confirmation of his autism was received during his trial.
