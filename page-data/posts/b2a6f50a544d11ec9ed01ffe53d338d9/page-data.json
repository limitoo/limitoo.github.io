An ensemble of art school kids and unsuspecting patrons milled about, while a D.J. played mediocre 2000s hip-hop. Before long, Arca took over the turntables, and anticipation and curiosity percolated through the air.\", \"She plugged in her USB and grinned as she blasted unreleased treasures, filling the room with glitchy electronic shrapnel that would become her devastating self-titled album a few months later. Only a handful of people in the crowd knew who she was \\u2014 at the time, she was mostly an experimental electronic producer with a reputation for harnessing industrial dissonance, the high drama of classical composition and uncomfortable metallic grit. Her relative anonymity allowed her to let loose in front of the small crowd, and those who clicked with the percussive, ululating machinations that filtered out of her USB hollered and jerked along.\", \"Since then, Alejandra Ghersi has become a multidisciplinary performance artist, producer and singer, but her years as a club kid \\u2014 abundant with improvisation, spontaneity and openness \\u2014 remain a foundational part of her identity.\", \"\\u201cDance floors are where I found freedom,\\u201d the Venezuelan-born artist said over a video call from her home in Barcelona, Spain, her lips painted a crimson red and a stainless steel choker clinging tightly around her neck. \\u201cWhen I moved to New York at age 17, I was very repressed. There were a lot of colors that I was muting internally.\\u201d\", \"Today, Arca\\u2019s volume is turned up loud. Her art \\u2014 a grotesque cyberpunk visual vocabulary and disjointed, shape-shifting music \\u2014 has commanded the attention of rebels across fashion, music and art. She has produced for FKA twigs, Bj\\u00f6rk and Kanye West, modeled in campaigns for Bottega Veneta and Calvin Klein, and composed a constantly transforming soundtrack for the Museum of Modern Art\\u2019s lobby using artificial intelligence. This year, she was up for her first Grammy and Latin Grammy Awards.\", \"Her latest endeavor is \\u201cKICK,\\u201d a five-album masterwork accompanied by an elaborate 3-D visual world, conceptualized in collaboration with the multimedia artist Frederik Heyman. Some of the albums showcase her most irreverent take on pop music yet, while still sharpening her desire to denaturalize and interrogate all kinds of boundaries: of the physical body, of immigrant identity, of biological conceptions of gender, rendered in part by blurring the line between flesh and technology.\", \"\\u201cOut of all the stories that we write and we choose to share as world builders, as storytellers, for me, the ones that are most exciting are the ones that point to a recognition of a boundary,\\u201d she said.\", \"Ghersi often speaks like this, sharing high-level abstractions on the artistic and philosophical motivations of her work. In two long interviews in November, her thoughts unraveled like elongated paragraphs, reminiscent of a Jorge Luis Borges story.\", \"\\u201cFor me, it\\u2019s important not to be a snapshot of one of my backgrounds, but to be able to map all of those things,\\u201d she said. \\u201cTo let those differences be. And not feel ashamed of them.\\u201d\", \"GHERSI HAS BEEN dreaming of creating conceptual work like the \\u201cKICK\\u201d series since she was a teenager. She grew up moving between the United States and Caracas, playing gaita, a type of folk music, as well as performing dreamy synth pop as Nuuro. When she was 17, she came to New York to attend N.Y.U. Her first EPs as Arca, \\u201cStretch 1\\u201d and \\u201cStretch 2\\u201d from 2012, are bass-heavy, mosaic inversions of club music and hip-hop; the second drew the attention of West, who recruited her to work on a few songs for \\u201cYeezus.\\u201d\", \"Next came a series of mixtapes and studio albums \\u2014 \\u201cXen,\\u201d \\u201cMutant\\u201d and \\u201cArca\\u201d \\u2014 that revealed Ghersi\\u2019s gifts as an artist in her own right. Here, she stretched and collaged celestial synth tones and haunting, cavernous echoes of sound, suffused with tortured romantic anguish.\", \"\\u201cKiCk i\\u201d arrived in the summer of 2020 and contains some of the grandiose, forlorn torch songs that appeared on her self-titled album, as well as features from Bj\\u00f6rk, Rosal\\u00eda, Shygirl and Sophie. But it also pointed to the directions Ghersi would explore in the collection\\u2019s following albums, as she continued to slice up pop templates, concoct manic breakbeats, luxuriate in synth excess and cut and paste the jagged edges of reggaeton.\", \"The \\u201cKICK\\u201d albums are inspired by expansive works like \\u201cDer Ring des Nibelungen,\\u201d the 19th century collection of German operas by Richard Wagner, and the \\u201cCremaster\\u201d cycle, an aesthetic universe created by the contemporary artist Matthew Barney that includes feature-length films, sculptures, photographs and drawings. Ghersi said she sees each record as non-hierarchical; she suggests listening to the albums in one go, even if it isn\\u2019t in order.\", \"She described \\u201cKICK\\u201d as a series of \\u201cself-contained, mythical, almost world-building exercises that interrelate to one another,\\u201d in a mid-November video interview, wearing a simple gray hoodie. A mustard Telfar purse hung from a coat hook in the background, and at one point, her striped cat, Lain, jumped into the frame to say hello.\", \"The visual universe of \\u201cKICK,\\u201d which includes the videos for \\u201cPrada/Rakata\\u201d and the album covers, is a bleak technological dystopia, sculpted in 3-D from close-up images of Ghersi\\u2019s body. There are robotic arms, electrical cables, fantastical beasts and references to the Venezuelan folk figure Mar\\u00eda Lionza, as well as cameos of Ghersi\\u2019s own paintings and calligraphy.\", \"Ghersi\\u2019s vision for \\u201cKICK\\u201d unfolded after her 2017 album. Between the projects, she began identifying as a nonbinary trans woman. \\u201cI felt like that was something that required certain care to undergo slash survive at times. It just took up all my RAM \\u2014 that reckoning that I\\u2019d been putting off for so long,\\u201d she said.\", \"Some of her new tracks venture into the outer edges of mainstream pop, which Ghersi has flirted with more openly over the last few years. (In September, she released her official remix of Lady Gaga\\u2019s \\u201cRain on Me,\\u201d and one of the tracks on \\u201cKICK ii\\u201d features Sia.) \\u201cWhat\\u2019s magical for me about engaging with pop is to not try to make a song that I think other people will like at the expense of an experiment or a sound that I love,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s to actually create a bridge for those that have different aesthetic sensibilities or different backgrounds to meet in a shared space that pop can provide.\\u201d\", \"That sense of communion is at the center of Ghersi\\u2019s work. She thinks deeply about blurring the barrier between spectator and performer, allowing audience participation to permeate her shows. During her 2019 performance series at the Shed in Manhattan, a three-night engagement called \\u201cMutant;Faith,\\u201d Arca wore hoofed stilts, munched on her custom acrylic talons and invited audience members to dance with her on a dirt surface that doubled as the stage.\", \"Bj\\u00f6rk, who co-produced her own albums \\u201cVulnicura\\u201d and \\u201cUtopia\\u201d with Arca, said she was immensely proud of her friend during the performances. \\u201cShe improvised alone for hours, no two nights the same. Willing to make herself super vulnerable, and therefore also super fierce,\\u201d she wrote over email. \\u201cIt is rare to have someone who has both emotional intelligence, high programming technique, performance and singing, humor and drama, gentleness and brutality. It is easy to admire this hyperhuman!\\u201d\", \"Part of Ghersi\\u2019s practice has involved exposing both the softness and ferocity required of femme performers in pop culture. \\u201cIf you over identify with the diva, it starts to prevent you from feeling things,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s this weird sweet spot where you can deploy it almost as a way of letting you cross the threshold of pressure exerted on you under that spotlight. You can really feel a lot and communicate a lot to audiences.\\u201d\", \"ON THE COVER for \\u201cKICK ii,\\u201d Ghersi is squatting in a black bodysuit, her bra enveloping her breasts like a cage. Robotic arms protrude from her back, and black belts are buckled around her thighs. Her right pinkie finger hyperextends into the exposed flesh of another body, which appears upside down, outfitted with a device reminiscent of a milking machine. The album artwork for the other installments in the cycle explore similar motifs of body modification via mechanical aberration: a limb converted into a machine gun, or thick electrical wires attached to her nipples.\", \"\\u201cWorking with these themes of body and technology is something that I\\u2019ve been drawn to aesthetically since as long as I can remember,\\u201d Ghersi said, citing her love of anime, video games like Final Fantasy and the science fiction of Ursula K. Le Guin.\", \"The process of designing each scene from the series took over a year. \\u201cI exclusively work in digitally altered, photorealistic rendered environments,\\u201d Heyman said over email. \\u201cWe wanted Arca to transcend the physical world into an extensive digital s\\u00e9ance.\\u201d\", \"Electronic music has long been a site of affirmation and ideation for queer and trans artists and fans. And for some time, feminist scholars, performance artists and journalists, like Donna Haraway, Stelarc and Sasha Geffen, have been asking questions about the figure of the cyborg and its capacity to free the body from gendered entrapment.\", \"When organic tissue and wiring meet, what kinds of gender-soft, border-permeable futures might we be able to dream of? In her new work, Ghersi appears to answer this question more directly. \\u201cThere is a particular kind of skepticism or cynicism in the face of the modified body,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAs if there was a shame to the transformation of the body.\\u201d\", \"SHAME IS A feeling Ghersi has spent a lot of time with. Between \\u201cArca\\u201d and \\u201cKiCK i,\\u201d she said she felt deeply stagnant, even bitter, a consequence of experiencing gender dysphoria.\", \"\\u201cI was stuck in sorrow because I wasn\\u2019t letting myself feel certain anger in my life,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAfter you feel both sorrow and the anger, then you can go back to grounding and see the beauty of life.\\u201d\", \"Across the \\u201cKICK\\u201d cycle, Ghersi reclaims those emotions as celebration. On \\u201cAlien Inside,\\u201d a demented guitar power ballad, the featured vocalist Shirley Manson of Garbage chants: \\u201cRemember the post human celestial sparkle/A mutant faith/A mutant faith/Your dignity.\\u201d Ghersi said the term \\u201cmutant faith\\u201d is a belief in the promise of the othered. \\u201cA faith for mutants, outcasts, freaks, weirdos, the othered, migrants,\\u201d she explained. \\u201cAn intersectional rallying cry for the spirit.\\u201d\", \"That artistic philosophy extends to language, too. Over the course of the \\u201cKICK\\u201d cycle, Ghersi moves between English and Spanish. She sang entirely in Spanish on her self-titled album. The decision \\u201cwas almost a manifesto of which language felt more intimate for me,\\u201d she said. By returning to Spanish, weaving reggaeton textures and Venezuelan folklore and reveling in the possibilities of post humanism, Ghersi is conjuring her own kind of trans immigrant futurism.\", \"\\u201cI do see a lot of possibility for the creation of a self that isn\\u2019t a photograph, that can change over time,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI think the Latinx community is that. It\\u2019s going to be shape-shifting ever after and forever, hopefully in the same way that queerness is.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b2a6f50a544d11ec9ed01ffe53d338d9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b2a6f50a544d11ec9ed01ffe53d338d9"}},
