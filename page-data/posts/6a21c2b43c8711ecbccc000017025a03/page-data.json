The first time I ever heard it, I was with my sister in our kitchen. I was 13. I was eating a bowl of Alpha-Bits cereal. It came on the radio, and my sister \\u2014 only a year older but centuries cooler \\u2014 told me, \\u201cThis is the greatest song ever.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s impossible for me to hear that song now without thinking of her.\", \"But when Patrisha McLean, Don McLean\\u2019s ex-wife, hears \\u201cAmerican Pie,\\u201d she isn\\u2019t reminded of golden moments of adolescence or even the classic age of rock \\u2019n\\u2019 roll memorialized by the song. Ms. McLean says she was subjected to years of emotional and physical abuse from her former husband.\", \"Ms. McLean was married to her husband for 29 years before the night five years ago that she made a 911 call. In the aftermath, Mr. McLean was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. He was charged with six misdemeanors; he pleaded guilty to four as part of a plea agreement in which the domestic violence charge would be dismissed after a year. For the other three charges \\u2014 criminal restraint, criminal mischief and making domestic violence threats \\u2014 he paid some $3,000 in fines.\", \"Since then, Ms. McLean founded Finding Our Voices, a Maine-based nonprofit dedicated to educating people about domestic abuse and providing services for victims. Meanwhile, Mr. McLean was honored in August with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He denies having ever assaulted his wife, and his lawyer has said that he pleaded guilty \\u201cnot because he was in fact guilty of anything but to provide closure for his family and keep the whole process as private as possible.\\u201d His iconic song still plays on the radio.\", \"The past several years have seen a reassessment of our country\\u2019s many mythologies \\u2014 from the legends of the generals of the Confederacy to the historical glossing over of slaveholding founding fathers. But as we take another look at the sins of our historical figures, we\\u2019ve also had to take a hard look at our more immediate past and present, including the behavior of the creators of pop culture. That reassessment extends now to the people who wrote some of our best-loved songs. But what to do with the art left behind? Can I still love their music if I\\u2019m appalled by various events in the lives of Johnny Cash or Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis? Or by Eric Clapton\\u2019s racist rants and anti-vaccination activism?\", \"Of course, there is no easy answer here. Even Ms. McLean doesn\\u2019t think \\u201cAmerican Pie\\u201d should be banned from playlists, like some other pieces of classic rock produced by disgraced musicians. Gary Glitter\\u2019s \\u201cRock and Roll (Part 2),\\u201d more popularly known as \\u201cThe Hey Song,\\u201d for instance, was pulled from airplay after the musician was convicted of possession of child pornography and a series of sex abuse offenses against young girls.\", \"Instead, Ms. McLean told me, she feels we should reconsider how we elevate these artists. It\\u2019s the tarnished creators, she said, that we should not celebrate. In other words: The problem with \\u201cAmerican Pie\\u201d isn\\u2019t the song. It\\u2019s the singer. \\u201cAmerican Pie\\u201d remains a great song. In 2016 the Library of Congress selected the original recording for preservation in the National Recording Registry.\", \"Indeed, it would almost be easier if it were just the song. The Rolling Stones quietly removed \\u201cBrown Sugar\\u201d from their current U.S. tour set list. The track\\u2019s racist lyrics, which refer to slave ships and rape, have been controversial since the song was first a hit in 1971 \\u2014 the same year as \\u201cAmerican Pie.\\u201d And yet the guitarist Keith Richards, when asked about the removal, seemed a little uneasy with the decision: \\u201cI\\u2019m trying to figure out with the sisters quite where the beef is. Didn\\u2019t they understand this was a song about the horrors of slavery?\\u201d\", \"There are a lot of things I revere about \\u201cBrown Sugar,\\u201d and Mr. Richards\\u2019s guitar riffs not least. But I can tell you that in 50 years, it has not once occurred to me that this song might even remotely be about the empowerment of Black women. If the Stones don\\u2019t know why the song has to go, does simply removing it from their tour sheet go far enough?\", \"For a lot of baby boomers, it\\u2019s painful to realize that some of the songs first lodged in our memories in adolescence really need a second look. And it\\u2019s hard to explain why younger versions of ourselves ever thought they were OK in the first place.\", \"I want to live in a world where I can be moved by art and music and literature without having to come up with elaborate apologies for that work or for its creators.\", \"But does such a world exist? It is hard to think of some of our greatest artists without also thinking of their messy, sometimes destructive lives. In so many cases, it\\u2019s the very chaos of those lives that has helped create the art. It\\u2019s easy to romanticize that chaos and to ignore the wreckage artists can leave in their wakes.\", \"It was Don McLean, in \\u201cAmerican Pie,\\u201d who asked if music can save our mortal souls. My guess is probably not. But it can help us to time travel, and not only to our adolescent past. Maybe reconsidering those songs, and their artists, can inspire us to think about the future and how to bring about a world that is more inclusive and more just.\"]","href_hash":"6a21c2b43c8711ecbccc000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6a21c2b43c8711ecbccc000017025a03"}},
