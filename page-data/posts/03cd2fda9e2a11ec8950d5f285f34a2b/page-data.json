For many Ukrainians, the invasion is also a painful echo of their past, when they survived the Holocaust.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I feel like I'm dreaming,\\\" 88-year-old Natalia Berezhnaya told the humanitarian group American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) in a video. Berezhnaya, who has a home care worker through the group, was born in the Ukrainian city of Dnepropetrovsk, now called Dnipro, in 1934.

Now, her home care worker is helping her survive the Russian invasion.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's hard to believe that you might be going through the same thing again that you went through in '41,\\\" she said. \\\"This is war. Any ways, any paths that exist to stop it \\u2014 it must be stopped. And end this bloodshed.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"She said that \\\"fear\\\" is \\\"not the word\\\" to describe how she's feeling now.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's hard to wrap my mind around the fact that in '41, I had to hide in the basement of this building,\\\" she said, \\\"and that I'm going to have to do that again now.\\\" \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Before Germany invaded the country in June 1941, Ukraine was home to the largest Jewish population in Europe, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. By that September, the Nazi combat soldiers occupied the capital city, Kyiv, and immediately started persecuting the Jewish population.\", \"On September 29, 1941, the Nazis began a systematic massacre of Kyiv's Jews. Over the course of two days, they murdered nearly 34,000 people. The ravine where the mass shootings took place, known as Babyn Yar (or Babi Yar), is said to be the \\\"largest mass grave of the Holocaust.\\\" The memorial site was hit by a Russian missile on March 1.\", \"It's believed that at least 1.5 million Jews were killed in Ukraine during the Holocaust, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.
