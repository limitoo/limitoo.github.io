Just one subject brought her up short. When pondering younger artists who\\u2019ve publicly cited her as an inspiration, she paused and threw up her arms. \\u201cI can\\u2019t think of one. So many people say, \\u2018Joni Mitchell is my big influence,\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd I thought, wait a minute. Didn\\u2019t I influence anybody?\\u201d\", \"She might not get the loudest shout-outs, but there\\u2019s no denying that Ian has often served as a cultural clairvoyant.\", \"In 1967, she became one of the first fully self-determined female singer-songwriters in pop, having penned every track on her debut album, which was released one month before Laura Nyro\\u2019s, a year before Joni Mitchell\\u2019s and three before Carole King\\u2019s.\", \"The subjects she became most famous for writing about, outliers at the time, have since become ubiquitous. Her breakthrough hit, \\u201cSociety\\u2019s Child,\\u201d written in 1965 when she was 14, was one of the first charting songs to center on an interracial romance. Her biggest score, \\u201cAt Seventeen,\\u201d which reached No. 2 in 1975, confronted lookism and bullying with a candor that anticipated the work of contemporary artists including Billie Eilish, Demi Lovato and Lizzo. Ian was also one of the first gay pop stars to come out in the early \\u201990s, and she championed free downloads as a promotional device back when the industry did everything it could to shut them down.\", \"Ian had few role models for her self-determined path, citing only Nina Simone and Victoria Spivey, a blues singer and writer who made her first impact in the 1920s. Otherwise, she said, \\u201ceverything was male-identified.\\u201d\", \"The disparity between the world in which she carved her path and today has been on Ian\\u2019s mind lately because of a major decision she made in the last year. At 70, she will release her final album, \\u201cThe Light at the End of the Line,\\u201d this Friday, followed by a valedictory tour. \\u201cI\\u2019m done,\\u201d she said, with a mixture of relief and anticipation. Ian said the wear and tear of serving as her own manager and song publisher, along with life as a touring musician, left little time for the thing she loves most.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m a writer first,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI care desperately about writing \\u2014 any kind of writing.\\u201d\", \"That includes haiku, short stories and a novel she hopes to finish in her coming life. She\\u2019ll work on everything in a nearly completed addition to her home, on an island in Tampa Bay where she lives with her wife of 19 years, Patricia Snyder, a retired criminal defense lawyer.\", \"Her final songs have a summary mission. In the title track, an elegant acoustic ballad, she bids adieu to her fans. \\u201cSome of them have stuck with me for 56 years,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s longer than I\\u2019ve known most of my family.\\u201d In \\u201cI\\u2019m Still Standing,\\u201d the stalwart melody underscores lyrics that embrace the physical changes brought by time, which, Ian said, explains the white hair and lack of makeup she proudly sported in our interview. In the classically influenced piano piece \\u201cNina,\\u201d she salutes one of the artists she most admires, her friend, Nina Simone, who cut a bracingly rueful version of Ian\\u2019s song \\u201cStars\\u201d in 1976.\", \"\\u201cNina was so complicated,\\u201d Ian said. \\u201cShe could be the most astonishing friend and also the most horrible person. But, as a solo performer, she was the single best I\\u2019ve ever seen.\\u201d\", \"Some of the new songs are more expressly political. \\u201cPerfect Little Girl\\u201d extends the theme of \\u201cAt 17,\\u201d while in \\u201cResist\\u201d she repurposes the social protest of earlier songs with lyrics that, among other things, use raw language to capture the violence of female genital mutilation. As with \\u201cSociety\\u2019s Child,\\u201d some radio stations have told her they won\\u2019t play it. \\u201cThey said it\\u2019s too suggestive,\\u201d Ian said. \\u201cIs the song sexual in some way I\\u2019m not aware of?\\u201d\", \"Ian was reared to raise such questions. Her father, a music teacher, and her mother, a secretary at a college, ran a progressive summer camp in upstate New York. Because of her parents\\u2019 politics, the FBI tapped the family phone, tracked their activities and discouraged schools from hiring her father, which she wrote about on the 2000 album \\u201cGod and the FBI.\\u201d\", \"Ian\\u2019s upbringing in the mainly Black area of East Orange, N.J., helped inspire her to write \\u201cSociety\\u2019s Child\\u201d in 1965, one year after the Civil Rights Act was passed. Her producer, Shadow Morton, a key shaper of the girl group sound, had a deal with Atlantic Records that financed the recording, but the label declined to release it. Ian was never told why, though she said Jerry Wexler, the Atlantic president at the time, later apologized for the decision. Verve Records picked up the song and released it twice in 1966, without success.\", \"A major break came the next year when she was invited to appear on a CBS-TV special, \\u201cInside Pop: The Rock Revolution,\\u201d for which the host Leonard Bernstein used his enormous cultural currency to lend legitimacy to the explosive new music of the \\u201960s. Ian said her song \\u201cwouldn\\u2019t have gone anywhere without the show.\\u201d Yet its focus on race scared off enough radio stations to halt its charge up the Billboard chart at No. 14.\", \"After \\u201cSociety\\u2019s Child,\\u201d Verve released three more Ian albums that bombed, but in 1973, Roberta Flack covered her song \\u201cJesse\\u201d and scored a hit, which helped Ian get a contract with Columbia Records. \\u201cJanis Ian wrote songs that touch my heart,\\u201d Flack wrote in an email. \\u201cShe tells stories in her songs that many of us can relate to \\u2014 tender experiences that help us articulate what we feel about how the world treats us in so many ways.\\u201d\", \"Ian\\u2019s second album for the label, \\u201cBetween the Lines,\\u201d featured \\u201cAt Seventeen,\\u201d with lyrics capturing the naked shame Ian felt at being considered \\u201can ugly duckling\\u201d with an honesty so brutal, it made some people uncomfortable \\u2014 including its author. \\u201cThat song was scary to write and scary to sing,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI would sing it with my eyes closed because I was so sure the audience would laugh at me. It was astonishing to me to realize, first, that they weren\\u2019t laughing. And, second, that it applied to boys too.\\u201d\", \"The song\\u2019s nuanced and erudite lyrics also accounted for the loss of self that can be suffered by women considered the most desirable \\u2014 the very type who bullied Ian. \\u201cTheir lives are an eternal beauty contest,\\u201d she said.\", \"Ian believes her willingness to write about uncomfortable subjects has become her m\\u00e9tier. \\u201cPlenty of other artists have a gift for melody and vocals and great lyrics,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThe only thing I think I do better is to talk about things that people have a hard time voicing. I give them a safe way to voice them.\\u201d\", \"Though Ian finds it distressing that the difficult subjects she has written about remain relevant decades later, as she prepares to leave the music business, she believes the world has changed considerably from when she started. \\u201cIt\\u2019s too easy to fall down that rabbit hole of saying \\u2018nothing has improved,\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cI can no longer be arrested in this country for being gay. That\\u2019s a huge difference. I firmly believe that things work out the way they\\u2019re supposed to. Whether that will be in my lifetime, I don\\u2019t know. But I do believe things will be better.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"92b0a2bc77a211ec802c1fcd6b62c31b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"92b0a2bc77a211ec802c1fcd6b62c31b"}},
