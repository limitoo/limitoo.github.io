But the artist with the most chances to win is Jon Batiste, the composer and bandleader known for his work in television and film, who was nominated 11 times, including for his eclectic, soul-inflected album \\u201cWe Are.\\u201d\", \"Batiste, who also emerged last year as a voice of social protest, will face off in some of the most prestigious categories, like album and record of the year, as well as in an array of genre fields \\u2014 including R&B, jazz, American roots and classical \\u2014 at the ceremony, which is scheduled for Jan. 31 in Los Angeles, and will be broadcast by CBS.\", \"The list of nominees is even more robust than usual this year, after the Recording Academy, which presents the awards, expanded the ballots for the top four categories \\u2014 album, record and song of the year, and best new artist \\u2014 to include 10 nominees, up from eight. As recently as four years ago, there were just five slots in those categories.\", \"For album of the year, Batiste \\u2014 perhaps best known as the musical director on \\u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\\u201d on CBS \\u2014 competes against Bieber (\\u201cJustice,\\u201d in a deluxe version), Doja Cat (\\u201cPlanet Her\\u201d), Rodrigo (\\u201cSour\\u201d), Eilish (\\u201cHappier Than Ever\\u201d), Taylor Swift (\\u201cEvermore\\u201d), Lil Nas X (\\u201cMontero\\u201d), Kanye West (\\u201cDonda\\u201d), H.E.R. (\\u201cBack of My Mind\\u201d), and Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga (\\u201cLove for Sale,\\u201d a tribute to Cole Porter).\", \"Record of the year, which recognizes the recording of a single track, pits hits like Rodrigo\\u2019s \\u201cDrivers License,\\u201d Bieber\\u2019s \\u201cPeaches,\\u201d Doja Cat\\u2019s \\u201cKiss Me More,\\u201d Lil Nas X\\u2019s \\u201cMontero (Call Me by Your Name)\\u201d and \\u201cLeave the Door Open\\u201d by Silk Sonic, the retro-soul project of Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, against Eilish\\u2019s \\u201cHappier Than Ever,\\u201d Brandi Carlile\\u2019s \\u201cRight on Time,\\u201d Bennett and Lady Gaga\\u2019s \\u201cI Get a Kick Out of You,\\u201d and \\u201cI Still Have Faith in You,\\u201d a comeback single by Abba \\u2014 the Europop icons who were never nominated for a Grammy in their heyday of the 1970s and early \\u201980s.\", \"For song of the year, a songwriter\\u2019s award, the nominees include \\u201cDrivers License,\\u201d \\u201cHappier Than Ever,\\u201d \\u201cKiss Me More,\\u201d \\u201cLeave the Door Open,\\u201d \\u201cPeaches,\\u201d \\u201cRight on Time\\u201d and \\u201cMontero,\\u201d along with Ed Sheeran\\u2019s \\u201cBad Habits,\\u201d Carlile and Alicia Keys\\u2019s \\u201cA Beautiful Noise,\\u201d and \\u201cFight for You\\u201d by H.E.R., who won the prize last year for a protest anthem, \\u201cI Can\\u2019t Breathe.\\u201d\", \"The new artist category is a mix of fresh pop stars and lesser-known acts. It includes Rodrigo, the singer and actress who rocketed to fame this year with hits like \\u201cDrivers License\\u201d and \\u201cGood 4 U\\u201d; the Kid Laroi, who has been ubiquitous on pop radio with \\u201cStay,\\u201d featuring Bieber; and Saweetie, whose \\u201cBest Friend\\u201d featuring Megan Thee Stallion is another radio fixture; along with Finneas, Eilish\\u2019s producer brother; Japanese Breakfast, the alternative project led by Michelle Zauner, who has also won acclaim as a memoirist; the band Glass Animals; Arlo Parks; Baby Keem; Jimmie Allen; and Arooj Aftab.\", \"Harvey Mason Jr., the chief executive of the academy, said in an interview that the decision to expand the ballot was in part driven by the rapid growth of the quantity of music released in the streaming age; according to Spotify, for example, some 60,000 tracks are added to that service every day.\", \"\\u201cWe saw an opportunity,\\u201d Mason said. \\u201cWe felt it was an important time to allow our members to be heard in a wider and deeper way.\\u201d\", \"One prominent name that is nowhere to be found on this year\\u2019s ballot is Morgan Wallen, the country singer-songwriter who made one of the year\\u2019s most popular albums, \\u201cDangerous: The Double Album\\u201d \\u2014 it held the No. 1 spot on Billboard\\u2019s chart for 10 weeks straight \\u2014 but came under fire after he was caught on video casually using a racial slur.\", \"Wallen has spent much of the year in industry purgatory, dropped from most radio playlists, though he remains a steady seller and is planning a major tour next year. His absence from top categories like album of the year is not surprising, yet he was also not nominated for any country award, despite holding on to substantial support in Nashville. (At the Country Music Association Awards this month, \\u201cDangerous\\u201d was a contender for album of the year.)\", \"In the music industry, this year\\u2019s nominations are being scrutinized for the effects of a series of changes to the Recording Academy\\u2019s voting procedures, which have come under harsh criticism in recent years, often because of whom they have left out.\", \"Last year, for example, Abel Tesfaye, who performs as the Weeknd, accused the Grammys of being \\u201ccorrupt\\u201d after he failed to receive any nominations, despite his album \\u201cAfter Hours\\u201d being a gigantic hit. In protest, Tesfaye pledged not to submit his music for Grammy consideration in the future.\", \"His attack focused attention on a little-understood part of the nomination process \\u2014 the use of \\u201creview committees,\\u201d whose anonymous members pared down the choices of the academy\\u2019s more than 11,000 voting members to a final ballot, ostensibly to preserve the awards\\u2019 integrity.\", \"But those committees became the focus of criticism for perceived conflicts of interest and other agendas, and this year, the academy eliminated them in most categories. (They remain part of the process for \\u201ccraft\\u201d categories, like packaging, liner notes and engineering.)\", \"The impact of those changes on this year\\u2019s ballot may be debated in weeks to come. For the most part, the effect seems less dramatic than many expected. This year, the distribution of Grammy nods has followed a familiar pattern of mixing pop superstars with heroes of the old guard (like the 95-year-old Bennett) and deeply skilled musicians who have the respect of the industry\\u2019s rank-and-file, even if they do not top charts (like Batiste).\", \"Batiste was nominated for eight awards for \\u201cWe Are,\\u201d along with three connected to \\u201cSoul,\\u201d the 2020 animated film, for which Batiste has already won an Oscar for best original score (shared with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross).\", \"Another Grammy rule change has allowed more songwriters to become eligible for album of the year. In past years, writers had to contribute to 33 percent of an album to qualify, but that threshold has been removed. One effect is that dozens of names \\u2014 including featured artists, producers and engineers, in addition to songwriters \\u2014 can now be on the ballot as contributors to a single album. If Bieber\\u2019s \\u201cJustice\\u201d wins, for example, around 100 people will take home Grammys.\", \"Also notable are this year\\u2019s four rock categories. Last year, the Grammys earned plaudits for nominating many women, but this year the list is almost entirely male-dominated. For rock album, AC/DC competes against Paul McCartney, Foo Fighters, Chris Cornell and Black Pumas.\", \"Alternative music album features a more diverse mix, with Halsey (\\u201cIf I Can\\u2019t Have Love, I Want Power\\u201d) competing against Japanese Breakfast (\\u201cJubilee\\u201d), Arlo Parks (\\u201cCollapsed in Sunbeams\\u201d), St. Vincent (\\u201cDaddy\\u2019s Home\\u201d) and the men of Fleet Foxes (\\u201cShore\\u201d).\", \"Among other categories, the contenders for best pop vocal album are Bieber\\u2019s \\u201cJustice,\\u201d Doja Cat\\u2019s \\u201cPlanet Her,\\u201d Eilish\\u2019s \\u201cHappier Than Ever,\\u201d Rodrigo\\u2019s \\u201cSour\\u201d and Ariana Grande\\u2019s \\u201cPositions.\\u201d\", \"Drake, whose \\u201cCertified Lover Boy\\u201d was ignored by the top categories, is up for two awards: best rap performance (\\u201cWay 2 Sexy\\u201d) and best rap album, in which \\u201cCertified\\u201d will compete against \\u201cDonda,\\u201d J.

Jay-Z has won 23 Grammys so far.\", \"The nominations recognize music released from Sept. 1, 2020, to Sept. 30, 2021, and can be voted on by more than 11,000 members of the Recording Academy, who must qualify as working musicians.\", \"This year\\u2019s ballot was winnowed down from nearly 22,000 submissions \\u2014 down slightly from the more than 23,000 submitted last year, which was a record.\"]","href_hash":"f22c11464c8611ecb6a5077e88017f28"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f22c11464c8611ecb6a5077e88017f28"}},
