This means lower levels of support for those who have been earning less, including those in casual or seasonal work, and/or those with caring responsibilities,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Because of who predominantly does this type of work, we know that it will be young, female, and M\\u0101ori and Pacific people who will get the lowest payments from this long-awaited new scheme.\\\"\", \"He was also concerned about the cost of contributing to the scheme for people on lower incomes.\", \"\\\"For the thousands of families struggling right now to put food on the table, the 1.37 percent contribution that will have to come from their existing earnings could be the difference between making ends meet or not.\\\"\", \"The party also called for a broader overhaul of the welfare system, including guaranteed minimum income, individualised benefits, and a boost to income support.\", \"University of Auckland economics professor Susan St John warning of the complexity involved in setting up the new job insurance scheme.\", \"\\\"I don't think we should underestimate the scale of it and just how complex it's going to be,\\\" she told Checkpoint.\", \"\\\"In scale it is rivaling the size of ACC.\\\"\", \"She also told Checkpoint the scheme looked like it would not help low-income earners.\", \"\\\"Those of us that are working in the welfare sector would argue that the biggest problem is ... This scheme looks like it's designed to meet the needs of the higher income earner... stable jobs. In fact it seems like it's designed for 20th century conditions rather than 21st century conditions. So that's a big worry.\\\"\", \"Figures out today showed record-low levels of unemployment.\", \"That would have helped boost wage growth to 2.8 percent, its highest level in more than 12 years, but still lagging well behind the 5.9 percent inflation for the year ended December, the highest in more than three decades.\"]","href_hash":"18489a86844811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"18489a86844811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
