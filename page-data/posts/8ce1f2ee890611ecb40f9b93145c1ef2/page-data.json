The other two are Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone (\\u201cThe Godfather\\u201d and \\u201cThe Godfather Part II\\u201d) and Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker (in \\u201cThe Dark Knight\\u201d and \\u201cJoker\\u201d).\", \"But first, DeBose will face some formidable competition in the category: Aunjanue Ellis (\\u201cKing Richard\\u201d), Jessie Buckley (\\u201cThe Lost Daughter\\u201d), Judi Dench (\\u201cBelfast\\u201d) and Kirsten Dunst (\\u201cThe Power of the Dog\\u201d).\", \"In an interview on Tuesday morning from her home in New York, DeBose discussed the significance of being nominated for a role that reflects her identity, the best advice Moreno gave her and what\\u2019s next. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"Congratulations! Are you normally awake right now?\", \"Normally I\\u2019m up and going \\u2014 it\\u2019s been a very busy season. But last night I had a bit of anxiety-ridden insomnia. I didn\\u2019t sleep at all. I was very anxious about this morning. For everyone, not just on a personal note, but for our film.\", \"You and Moreno have the chance to make history as only the third pair of actors \\u2014 and the first women and people of color \\u2014 to win for playing the same role, in this case, 60 years apart. What does it mean to you to be able to follow in her footsteps?\", \"The nomination validates the fact that many interpretations are valid and good. It is absolutely possible to create a character based on the same initial text and have it stand on its own next to an already celebrated and iconic portrayal of that character. Anita is a wonderful character, and one that I\\u2019m so proud of. It\\u2019s just great because we are Latinas, we are here and it\\u2019s a really beautiful thing to be seen.\", \"Have you thought about what you\\u2019re going to say if you win? I assume you\\u2019ll be a little more prepared than Rita. (Moreno famously delivered one of the shortest acceptance speeches in Oscars history when she won in 1962: \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe it! Good Lord. I leave you with that.\\u201d)\", \"Honestly, I have not. Because I was like, \\u201cLook at that category!\\u201d I\\u2019m just genuinely happy to be in it. I haven\\u2019t got past that part yet. I hope that if I need to say something, I would be sensibly eloquent about it. But, if not, Rita\\u2019s fail-safe is always a good place to divert to. [In Rita voice] \\u201cOh my gosh! Thank you!\\u201d What an iconic acceptance speech.\", \"It was kind of perfect.\", \"Never more joy and true gratitude. And I mean that sincerely \\u2014 it\\u2019s written all over her face. It\\u2019s a great thing to watch.\", \"Even though your were initially star-struck, you developed a close bond with Moreno. What\\u2019s one piece of advice she gave you that\\u2019s stuck with you?\", \"She has always led with, \\u201cAriana, lean into everything that makes you unique.\\u201d And that\\u2019s what I did with the character, and it\\u2019s what I do in the midst of this crazy journey. I lean into things that make me unique both as an artist and as a human, and I try to share and celebrate those things. It\\u2019s imperative that young people realize they have possibility, and if they can see that in my work, then I\\u2019m doing something right.\", \"You come from a dance background, so I\\u2019m sure Anita\\u2019s crazy dancing skills weren\\u2019t too hard to master. But is there anything you had to learn for the film that was especially challenging?\", \"I\\u2019m not fluent in Spanish. So I was very focused on the language and not only ingraining myself in it, but finding her accent, understanding what was required of that in terms of how long she\\u2019d been in New York City.\", \"You\\u2019ve said you were nervous about your performance at the first screenings. What was the moment you knew you\\u2019d succeeded?\", \"I still don\\u2019t know if I got it right. I\\u2019m thrilled that people love the interpretation. As an artist, I see a million things that I\\u2019m like, \\u201cGosh, I wish I\\u2019d have done that better.\\u201d But what makes me feel secure in it is that I\\u2019ve heard from a lot of young people, specifically young Latinas, who say they see themselves in the work.\", \"You\\u2019ve said your Afro-Latina identity was something you fought to have be an integral part of your character, from your first meeting with Spielberg. How does it feel be nominated for a character who is a strong woman who can own her identity without any compromises like darkened skin, as Moreno\\u2019s was in the original film?\", \"This role embodies every facet of me, both as an artist and a human. It\\u2019s rare that you come across a part like this that celebrates the fullness of your skill set and honors your lived experience and your identity. So it is very special. And we\\u2019re just starting to get into the space where we can have those conversations, where we can get into the nitty-gritty of where Afro-Latinas fall within not only Hispanic culture but Black culture, because we belong to both. It\\u2019s important that we reflect that in our scripts and the projects we greenlight. And I say that specifically to AfroLatinidad, but representation across the board is imperative.\", \"Your roles in the past few years have run the gamut, from your Tony nomination for \\u201cSummer: The Donna Summer Musical\\u201d to your breakout role as a progressive schoolmarm in the musical Apple TV+ series \\u201cSchmigadoon!\\u201d What\\u2019s next for you?\", \"I don\\u2019t know. [Laughs] I don\\u2019t believe in limiting myself. I don\\u2019t like labels and I don\\u2019t like boxes, which is kind of ironic since we talk about a lot of things that I identify as. I\\u2019m in a moment with regard to my career where I\\u2019ve never had the types of opportunities that are coming my way. It\\u2019s a blessing to have choice.\", \"You broke out your tap skills in \\u201cSchmigadoon!\\u201d last year. Any other secret talents you want to showcase?\", \"Who knows? Maybe one day I\\u2019ll fly trapeze for a project. Maybe I\\u2019ll do more action stuff.\", \"I\\u2019m sure there are plenty of Marvel movies waiting for you.\", \"Oh, gosh. That\\u2019s quite the universe. We\\u2019ll see.\"]","href_hash":"8ce1f2ee890611ecb40f9b93145c1ef2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8ce1f2ee890611ecb40f9b93145c1ef2"}},
