Yet Theranos sent reports displaying those companies\\u2019 logos to investors, who testified that the reports lent the young start-up credibility and helped convince them to invest.\", \"On Monday, Ms. Holmes painted a different picture. Theranos did work with pharmaceutical companies, she testified. There were clinical studies and even a study published in a peer-reviewed journal. (Ms. Holmes\\u2019s lawyer did not name which one.)\", \"The questioning allowed Ms. Holmes to focus on Theranos\\u2019s early successes and the conversations she had with potential partners while glossing over the outcomes of those conversations. Ms. Holmes stopped short of addressing her later claims about Theranos\\u2019s successes and about the reports, which seemed to give Theranos stamps of approval from pharmaceutical companies.\", \"During her testimony, Ms. Holmes also attempted to deflect blame. She said she learned about Theranos\\u2019s technology from the scientists and doctors who worked in the company\\u2019s lab. She added that she believed them when they said the technology worked. The implication: Ms. Holmes could not have intended to deceive investors if she believed the technology was real.\", \"\\u201cWe thought this was a really big idea,\\u201d Ms. Holmes said.\", \"Ms. Holmes has been charged with 11 counts of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud. She has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, she faces up to 20 years in prison.\"]","href_hash":"360cb1ce4be511ecb2287b11b0ddc37e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"360cb1ce4be511ecb2287b11b0ddc37e"}},
