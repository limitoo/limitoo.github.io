This makes sense for a cross-disciplinary artist who sharpened the visions of other artists, including Kanye West and ASAP Rocky. As the founder and chief executive of Off-White and, later, the artistic director of Louis Vuitton men\\u2019s wear, he expanded the idea of what a collaboration could be. Evian water bottles, Ikea furniture, Warby Parker frames, compostable Cha Cha Matcha cups. To Mr. Abloh, every object was a canvas.\", \"Today collaborations have become, in the eyes of many, a runaway train. The glut of partnerships inevitably means that they often feel void of emotional connection. This was never the case for Mr. Abloh, whose personal and artistic interests always acted as his compass. One day he would work with the vegan cafe he frequented for lunch, the next with a multinational brand.\", \"And the products almost always became instant totems. Many shoes to come out of his lucrative, yearslong partnership with Nike are listed on resale markets for more than 10 times their original price. A limited-edition Mercedes-Benz and a Louis Vuitton collaboration with the Bathing Ape creator Nigo were among Mr. Abloh\\u2019s final projects.\", \"One of Off-White\\u2019s first collaborations was with this iconic Los Angeles skate shop. The brand, only three years old at this point, was so new that the capsule was pitched as its first foray into graphic tees. The category would later become a hero product for the logo-centric brand.\", \"This collection drew from fishermen motifs, highlighting Mr. Abloh\\u2019s penchant for unexpected references. \\u201cThe style of dress in that form-meets-function field I found interesting to explore with an Off-White sensibility,\\u201d he told GQ magazine at the time.\", \"Here\\u2019s when the collaborations really started kicking off. Mr. Abloh was commissioned by the denim brand to create 11 looks that featured spliced fabrics with bold, contrasting colors. The release was a hit.\", \"The distinctive visual identity of Off-White was really beginning to take shape at this point. The tee-focused drop featured what would become popular motifs for the brand, including a highlighter-green colorway and text-heavy designs.\", \"Mr. Abloh designed Wayfarer-inspired sunglasses for the brand. They sold quickly, as would many future Abloh collaborations.\", \"Mr. Abloh pulled a Tom Ford here and directed the music video for the emo rapper\\u2019s smash hit \\u201cXO Tour Llif3.\\u201d The video, with nearly 500 million views, even kicks off with the Off-White logo at the bottom. A true branded experience.\", \"With these pieces, the first of multiple collaborations, Off-White continued its streak of teaming up with some of the biggest legacy retail brands.\", \"Some of Mr. Abloh\\u2019s most popular and buzzy designs came in the form of his long-running Nike collaboration. The partnership kicked off with Mr. Abloh reconstructing 10 popular Nike models. During his time with Nike, Mr. Abloh also designed custom-made tennis dresses for Serena Williams, one of which featured a black tutu.\", \"A collaboration that, arguably, infused new life into the German suitcase brand after it joined the LVMH group in 2016. Possibly for the first time ever, see-through suitcases were in.\", \"Instagram is a key way that Off-White\\u2019s younger customers engage with fashion. So of course Off-White teamed up with the popular app to create face filters that allowed users to try on its new neon green sunglasses.\", \"Mr. Abloh\\u2019s creative ventures were not centered purely on fashion. For this one, he redesigned the to-go cups for a trendy matcha cafe with locations in Los Angeles and New York.\", \"Remember office wear? Well, before the work-from-home era, Mr. Abloh dedicated a 40-piece capsule collection with the e-retailer Mr Porter to modern office wear. In his vision, cherry red khakis and long-sleeve logo tees are the perfect Tuesday look.\", \"Another highly successful collaboration, this one led to select pieces selling on resale markets for astronomical markups. The collection, which featured a green rug emblazoned with \\u201cWET GRASS,\\u201d had hypebeasts waiting outside Ikeas as if they were Supreme shops.\", \"Off-White digitized its fall 2021 collection for Snapchat\\u2019s popular bitmojis, allowing users to deck out their personal avatars in sidebags and logos galore.\", \"In these pieces, released shortly before Mr. Abloh\\u2019s death, the designer focused his eye on remaking Jordan apparel, applying his popular cut-and-stitch aesthetic.\", \"The second collaboration between Mr. Abloh and the Japanese designer Nigo was also released shortly before Mr. Abloh\\u2019s death, merging aughts-flavored street wear tropes with the luxury house codes.\", \"One of the designer\\u2019s final projects was a collaboration with Mercedes-Benz. Titled \\u201cProject Maybach,\\u201d the decked-out coupe is heavy on the glitz and can be viewed at the Rubell Museum in Miami through Thursday.\"]","href_hash":"62180457534911ecbff92d96972b76d1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"62180457534911ecbff92d96972b76d1"}},
