This month, Mr. Coleman, a Democrat, was arrested and charged with domestic battery.\", \"Katie Hill, a Democratic former congresswoman from California, resigned in October 2019 after nude photos she said had been taken of her without her consent were posted online.\", \"And in 2017, the Defense Department opened an investigation into an all-male, invitation-only Facebook group called Marines United, in which members shared thousands of nude and other private photos of Marine Corps women without their knowledge or consent.\", \"The Maryland state prosecutor, Charlton T. Howard III, said in a charging document that Mr. Bradshaw had posted nude photographs of his former partner in several Reddit groups, or subreddits, and had written comments that were degrading and sexually explicit and included racial epithets.\", \"The photos were posted by accounts that had public user names made up of combinations of the victim\\u2019s name and birth date, Mr. Howard said. She is not named in the charging document and is instead identified as Victim 1.\", \"She told the authorities about the posts in May, according to the charging document, and said that the only person she had shared the photos with was Mr. Bradshaw. Prosecutors said they had connected the posts to an internet protocol address at his home.\", \"Mr. Bradshaw defeated a three-term incumbent in a runoff election in December and was sworn in as mayor of Cambridge, which has a population of about 13,000, in January.\", \"A lawyer for Mr. Bradshaw, Michael Belsky, did not respond to a request for comment.\", \"Mr. Bradshaw was arrested and released on his own recognizance on Monday, according to court documents. He faces a maximum penalty of 100 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 if convicted on all counts.\", \"Reddit bans users from posting nude photos without the subject\\u2019s permission. A representative said the company was investigating the incident and would remove any related content that violated its policies.\", \"The city of Cambridge said in a statement that its business would not be affected by the case because the head of its administrative business is the city manager, not the mayor.\", \"Lisae C. Jordan, the executive director of the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault, said the case against Mr. Bradshaw was a \\u201cvivid example\\u201d of the type of harassment survivors are describing as reports of revenge porn and online harassment have surged during the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cMore and more, we\\u2019re seeing people being faced with revenge porn, sexual exploitation with online sexual harassment,\\u201d Ms. Jordan said.\", \"The landscape for revenge porn cases has shifted significantly over the past decade. In 2013, three states had criminalized nonconsensual pornography. Today, 48 states have done so, said Mary Anne Franks, the president and legislative and tech policy director at the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative. Maryland\\u2019s revenge porn law went into effect in 2014.\", \"Dr. Franks said Maryland\\u2019s law, like others in the United States, was too restrictive because, to convict someone, prosecutors must prove that the person who shared the photos intended to cause serious emotional distress.\", \"That standard can protect people who say they posted photos for profit, to improve standing in their community or because they didn\\u2019t think the individual in the photo would care, Dr. Franks said. Prosecutors might have an easier time proving malicious intent in Mr. Bradshaw\\u2019s case, she said, because of the breadth and cruelty of the posts prosecutors accused him of making.\", \"\\u201cWhat\\u2019s so troubling about these kinds of crimes is they can\\u2019t really be undone in any way,\\u201d Dr. Franks said. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t compensate a victim afterward. You can\\u2019t really give her back what she has lost.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a3ed8d10473211ec991739dc57455788"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a3ed8d10473211ec991739dc57455788"}},
