The statement showed that officials decided to slow the monthly bond-buying that they had been using throughout the pandemic to keep money chugging through markets and to bolster growth more rapidly.\", \"Officials are slashing their purchases by twice as much as they had announced last month, a pace that would put them on track to end the program altogether in March. That decision came \\u201cin light of inflation developments and the further improvement in the labor market,\\u201d according to the policy statement.\", \"Speeding up the end of the Fed\\u2019s bond-buying will position the central bank to more promptly raise its policy interest rate \\u2014 a more traditional and more powerful tool \\u2014 if officials decide that doing so is necessary to keep inflation under control. The Fed\\u2019s economic projections suggested that officials expected to make three interest rate increases next year.\", \"\\u201cWith inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some time, the committee expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee\\u2019s assessments of maximum employment,\\u201d the Fed said in its new statement \\u2014 making it clear that officials feel their inflation goals have been achieved and putting the onus for rate increases squarely on labor market progress.\", \"By slowing bond-buying and moving toward rate increases, the Fed is adding less juice to the economic expansion. While officials spent much of the year laying out a patient path for winding down their pandemic-era help for the economy, they have turned more proactive in recent weeks as they have become more worried that a burst in inflation this year could linger. The Fed is supposed to keep prices stable while fostering a strong labor market, and those two goals are increasingly in tension.\", \"Consumer prices climbed 6.8 percent in November from a year earlier, the quickest pace of increase since 1982. The Fed\\u2019s preferred inflation gauge has shown slightly slower gains but has also moved up sharply.\", \"Fed officials initially expected a pop in prices this year to fade. Instead, pressures have broadened beyond goods affected by the pandemic, which have fallen victim to tangled supply chains, and into rent and shelter. In those big categories, upward trends can prove more lasting. Wages are climbing, as are consumer inflation expectations, which could also help price increases to persist.\", \"The Fed has been watching the evidence accumulate warily, though most officials still hold out hope that inflation will fade back toward their 2 percent annual average goal as global shipping routes clear through backlogs, factory production increases to meet demand, and consumers shift toward more normal spending patterns after scrambling to buy couches, cars and stationary bikes during the pandemic.\", \"But officials had begun to back away from helping the economy so much, announcing the initial plan to slow their bond-buying program following their November meeting.\", \"Then, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, signaled late last month and early in December that the central bank was increasingly focused on managing the risk that rapid price gains might linger.\", \"\\u201cI think the risk of higher inflation has increased,\\u201d Mr. Powell said while testifying before Congress in late November.\", \"Fed officials have also taken heart in the speed of the labor market recovery. The jobless rate has fallen to 4.2 percent, down sharply from the double-digits heights it reached early in the pandemic.\", \"Still, many people remain out of the labor market \\u2014 some because they have retired, but others because of virus fears or a lack of child care. That is making judging how close the economy is to the Fed\\u2019s goal of \\u201cmaximum employment\\u201d a more complicated task.\", \"Mr. Powell at times has suggested that full employment could be reached next year, but he also has expressed uncertainty around that call.\", \"\\u201cI think there\\u2019s room for a whole lot of humility here as we try to think about what maximum employment would be,\\u201d he said at a news conference in November.\", \"The Fed chair will take reporter questions at a news conference scheduled to start around 2:30 p.m.\"]","href_hash":"f262b2185dda11ec9a205968d5375e19"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f262b2185dda11ec9a205968d5375e19"}},
