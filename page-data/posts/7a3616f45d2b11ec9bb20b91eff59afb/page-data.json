Or so I learned in college, during the heyday of chemically induced inner journeys \\u2014 and again at the Vivian Beaumont Theater the other night. Though sometimes mesmerizing, \\u201cFlying Over Sunset,\\u201d the new musical about LSD that opened there on Monday, is mostly bewildering, and further proof that transcendence can\\u2019t be shared.\", \"It admits as much in its structure, which throws into one scenario (by James Lapine) three famous seekers who never actually got high together. We meet them separately, starting with the philosopher and novelist Aldous Huxley (Harry Hadden-Paton), tripping at a Hollywood drugstore in the late 1950s. Next comes the greatest of all male movie stars, Cary Grant (Tony Yazbeck), demanding the drug \\u2014 then legal \\u2014 from his second wife\\u2019s psychiatrist. Finally we drop in on the playwright and diplomat Clare Boothe Luce (Carmen Cusack), hallucinating \\u201ca sapphire dragonfly\\u201d soon after being nominated as ambassador to Brazil.\", \"Much of this is true \\u2014 if not the details of the visions then the settings and situations. But to advance the story beyond that, Lapine has to indulge in speculative nonfiction, a musical theater hallucinogen he has used to great effect before, in his play \\u201cTwelve Dreams,\\u201d inspired by Jungian imagery, and in his book for the musical \\u201cSunday in the Park With George,\\u201d about the painter Georges Seurat. Perhaps recalling Seurat\\u2019s pointillistic technique, he writes in a preface to \\u201cFlying Over Sunset\\u201d that his script \\u201cconnects the dots\\u201d of known history.\", \"It certainly connects the major players, bringing them together counterfactually, at the end of Act I, to discuss their common interest over champagne at the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood. In Act II, with the philosopher Gerald Heard (Robert Sella) as their \\u201cguide,\\u201d they indulge that interest together at Luce\\u2019s Malibu estate.\", \"Their trips take up perhaps two-thirds of the show \\u2014 and 100 percent of the songs, by Tom Kitt and Michael Korie. As a concept, that makes sense, not just because music is arguably the most transcendent of art forms (and is often lovely here) but also because the characters, as Lapine presents them, apparently need to be high to be fully alive.\", \"It\\u2019s hard to argue with him from personal experience; as he recently told The Times, he used LSD frequently while in graduate school. But the actual lives of Huxley, Grant and Luce do not support the idea that they were lacking in the rich complexity of humanity when sober.\", \"To correct for that problem, Lapine, who also directed the show, steers \\u201cFlying Over Sunset\\u201d in some very strange and ultimately tiresome directions. First, he assigns each character a buried emotional problem that needs resolving. Huxley is grieving the death of his wife. Grant, having never fully reconciled his imperturbable public persona with the terrorized child he once was, has problems with women. And Luce somehow feels guilt over the deaths of her mother and daughter, in car accidents she had nothing to do with.\", \"There\\u2019s an overly programmatic quality to that setup, especially as delivered in the exceedingly flat dialogue Lapine seems to favor. (\\u201cI think what\\u2019s interesting,\\u201d Heard says, \\u201cis that you each seem to be at a turning point in your lives.\\u201d) Perhaps the flatness is meant to set up the floridness of the trips, which compensate for the lack of real-world dramatic development by growing more and more outr\\u00e9 as the show, at two hours and 40 minutes, wears on.\", \"The first of those trips is at least efficient in characterizing Huxley, whom Hadden-Paton winningly portrays as a goofy know-it-all nerd. Spotting a Botticelli monograph at the drugstore, he imagines characters from the painting \\u201cThe Return of Judith to Bethulia\\u201d coming to life somewhat randomly around him, to the strains of some beautiful bel canto pastiche by Kitt and Korie. Here and elsewhere, you may be reminded of \\u201cSunday in the Park\\u201d for its tableaux vivants and shimmering orchestral effects, if not for its thematic discipline.\", \"And Grant\\u2019s maiden trip, involving an otherwise flat-footed encounter with his younger self (Atticus Ware) and violent father (Nehal Joshi), allows for a showstopping dance routine to a music hall ditty called \\u201cFunny Money.\\u201d The choreography for Yazbeck and Ware, by the tap phenom Michelle Dorrance, almost obliterates any qualms about the song\\u2019s psychobabbly premise.\", \"But for an audience not invested in Lapine\\u2019s personal imagery, the second act, with its nonstop LSD sequences, goes quickly downhill. A number called \\u201cI Like to Lead,\\u201d in which Sophia Loren, Grant\\u2019s co-star in the 1958 movie \\u201cHouseboat,\\u201d slaps him around in an allegory of female domination, is incoherent. Another, in which Grant imagines himself as a \\u201cgiant penis rocket ship\\u201d on a \\u201csecret mission\\u201d to spare the earth from disaster, is merely mortifying. Luce\\u2019s visit to heaven to see her mother and daughter, in a song called \\u201cAn Interesting Place,\\u201d is as banal as that title.\", \"At least there are compensations in the typically gorgeous technical wizardry of the Lincoln Center Theater production. The lighting (by Bradley King) and the projections (by 59 Productions) on Beowulf Boritt\\u2019s swirling-circles set \\u2014 along with the immersively psychedelic sound by Dan Moses Schreier \\u2014 bring us closer to the sensation of melting consciousness than the script ever manages. At times even the costumes (by Toni-Leslie James) seem to be tripping. And Dorrance\\u2019s choreography for the show\\u2019s opening, arranging the cast\\u2019s varying footfalls in rhythmic counterpoint, is sublime.\", \"These are not enough to outweigh Lapine\\u2019s failure to dramatize what he evidently sees as the life-enhancing possibilities of mind-altering drugs. If those possibilities exist, surely they are not to be found in a direct linkup of symptoms and cures, as proposed by \\u201cFlying Over Sunset.\\u201d During his Botticelli immersion, Huxley claims that his right eye, severely damaged from a childhood illness, has started \\u201cworking\\u201d again. Grant and Luce, having faced unfinished emotional business, emerge from their trips refreshed and ready to move on.\", \"But LSD, on its own, is not psychoanalysis by other means. And if the drug offers access to a shared consciousness that can help humans connect, neither the show nor the subsequent lives of its real-life characters demonstrate it. Luce, a brittle charmer in Cusack\\u2019s smart rendering, drifted ever rightward politically; Grant married three more times.\", \"As for Huxley, despite his supposedly improved eyesight, his overall health deteriorated quickly. On his deathbed in 1963, he asked to be injected with 100 micrograms of LSD. He was still a believer \\u2014 but in what? Some mysteries, this musical among them, are too interior to be understood.\"]","href_hash":"7a3616f45d2b11ec9bb20b91eff59afb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7a3616f45d2b11ec9bb20b91eff59afb"}},
