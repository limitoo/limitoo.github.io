Things come out, love is passed around, laughter is shared and there is a warmth that comes from all of that friction.\", \"\\u201cChillin\\u2019, Okay?!\\u201d starts at Issa\\u2019s apartment, where Molly, Kelli and Tiffany have met up to start a day of relaxation for Molly, who has been stressed because of her mother\\u2019s health crisis. They had planned to meet at the house and then head to a spa, but when a pipe bursts at the spa, they are forced to stay home until dinner.\", \"Disappointed, the girls start drinking and forget about the spa. Tiffany starts to play \\u201cLast Night,\\u201d by Diddy and Keyshia Cole, Molly starts to dance and pretends her wine bottle is a microphone. Issa suggests they play Questions in a Hat, where anonymous questions are thrown in a hat and randomly selected by players, but Kelli is skeptical. \\u201cYou know the power it has,\\u201d she says sinisterly.\", \"Questions in a Hat is less a game than an icebreaker exercise, designed to make the mind feel comfortable while exposing vulnerabilities. Even though the girls are friends and have become closer throughout\\u201cInsecure,\\u201d there are still things that need to be tugged out of them, like when Molly admits to having never seen \\u201cLove Jones\\u201d (guilty!) even though she bonded with Issa over the movie. Or when Tiffany admits to thinking about her husband when she masturbates.\", \"When deeper questions start to come up, Issa explains that she and Nathan are not in a good place. The girls listen and check Issa. That is what sisterhood is for: To let you know that yes, maybe you are inconsistent and maybe your boo is not wrong. The ladies are perfect at it \\u2014 funny, calm and just harsh enough.\", \"Issa says she is willing to start over, to let go of what she has with Nathan, but no one believes her \\u2014 not her girls and not the viewers. She also admits to feeling bad because Nathan has not returned her \\u201cI love you.\\u201d\", \"Molly then draws the \\u201cIf you could have one do-over, what would it be?\\u201d question.\", \"Issa has been thinking about her own do-over since she noticed that Lawrence moved back to Los Angeles. She has been considering reaching out to him for closure, she says, which she hadn\\u2019t shared with her friends.\", \"\\u201cI just wish I figured out what I wanted to do sooner,\\u201d she responds to Molly\\u2019s question.\", \"Later on, while Issa\\u2019s friends are ranking her lovers \\u2014 Daniel for the win \\u2014 she tells the girls that she saw Lawrence, Condola and Elijah at the hospital. Condola and Lawrence seemed like they were doing well, so Issa assumed they had rekindled their affair. But Kelli lets her know that things were not great with them at Tiffany\\u2019s child\\u2019s birthday party.\", \"\\u201cReally?\\u201d Issa responds, as if she were trapped in a hot car and a window had just magically opened. She tries to make the case for how she feels to her friends.\", \"\\u201cYou made the smart choice,\\u201d Molly reassures her.\", \"\\u201cSometimes it\\u2019s not about making the smart choice \\u2014 it just has to make sense to you,\\u201d Tiffany says.\", \"Issa\\u2019s eyes light up. Tiffany\\u2019s comment validates her feelings \\u2014 she\\u2019s looking for any reason to run back to who she knows and what feels safe. Things are shaky with Nathan and that instability can be exhausting. Sometimes you just need to be loved and supported.\", \"After the girls decide to stay in for the night, they cute up the balcony with rugs and throws and pass libations around. When Dro, the messiest of all \\u201cInsecure\\u201d men, calls Molly, Issa sees it as an excuse to call Lawrence, though she has no plan for what to say. Molly snatches her phone and hangs up.\", \"\\u201cGirl, you know I love you right?\\u201d she asks, and then reminds Issa about the earlier discussion of her inconsistency. \\u201cYou\\u2019re doing it \\u2014 like how is this going to help?\\u201d\", \"While Issa was thinking about backsliding toward Lawrence, the man himself was trying to repair his relationship with Condola. Issa has not realized \\u2014 or is choosing not to consider \\u2014 that Lawrence has a world of his own to take care of right now. A baby doesn\\u2019t care about Issa\\u2019s need for closure or even what Lawrence wants at all. It isn\\u2019t like before; starting over for Issa now means leaving safety totems like Lawrence behind.\", \"The next morning, Nathan calls and tells her that he loves her and that he knows he can be avoidant and childish. (I cannot confirm that calls like this happen in real life.) He promises to do better and she hangs up with a smile on her face. Then Lawrence returns her call from the night before. She does not pick up because she does not need a security blanket anymore.\", \"While there\\u2019s still part of me that secretly would like to see Issa and Lawrence end up together in the series finale, what I really want is for Issa to choose herself and the things she wants out of love, not desperation. I want her to chill, OK?\"]","href_hash":"d3939f1e564611ecb441496659f69416"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d3939f1e564611ecb441496659f69416"}},
