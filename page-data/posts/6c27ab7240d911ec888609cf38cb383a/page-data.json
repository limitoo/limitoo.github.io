Trump who promoted false claims of election fraud or worked to overturn the results of the 2020 election, including his former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn.\", \"The subpoenas demand records and testimony from Mr. Trump\\u2019s campaign manager Bill Stepien and a senior adviser, Jason Miller, as well as others associated with a so-called \\u201cwar room\\u201d of planners who sought to halt Congress\\u2019s counting of electoral votes before a violent mob overtook the Capitol. They include John Eastman, a lawyer who drafted a memo laying out how Mr. Trump could use Congress to try to overturn the election and Mr. Flynn, who discussed seizing voting machines and invoking certain national security emergency powers.\", \"The subpoenas demand that the witnesses turn over documents this month and sit for depositions in early December.\", \"\\u201cIn the days before the Jan. 6 attack, the former president\\u2019s closest allies and advisers drove a campaign of misinformation about the election and planned ways to stop the count of Electoral College votes,\\u201d Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the committee chairman, said in a statement. \\u201cThe select committee needs to know every detail about their efforts to overturn the election, including who they were talking to in the White House and in Congress, what connections they had with rallies that escalated into a riot, and who paid for it all.\\u201d\", \"The six subpoenas bring to 25 the number issued so far by the committee. More than 150 witnesses have testified in closed-door sessions with the committee\\u2019s investigators.\", \"Mr. Stepien was the manager of Mr. Trump\\u2019s re-election campaign, which urged state and party officials to affect the outcome of the 2020 election by asking states to delay or deny certification of electoral votes and by sending multiple slates of the votes to Congress to allow a challenge to the results, the committee said.\", \"Mr. Miller, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, spread the false claim of widespread fraud and coordinated with the former president and his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani in attempts to overturn the election, the committee said. It cited the fact Mr. Miller participated in a meeting on Jan. 5 at the Willard Hotel in Washington in which Mr. Giuliani, Stephen K. Bannon, and others discussed pressuring former Vice President Mike Pence to not certify the Electoral College results.\", \"The panel also subpoenaed the Trump campaign\\u2019s national executive assistant Angela McCallum, who reportedly left voice mail for an unknown Michigan state representative in which she said that she wanted to know whether the Trump campaign could \\u201ccount on\\u201d the representative. She is also believed to have told the representative that they had the authority to appoint an alternate slate of electors based on purported evidence of widespread election fraud, the committee said.\", \"Mr. Eastman has been the subject of intense scrutiny in recent weeks after it was revealed that he wrote a memo to Mr. Trump suggesting that Mr. Pence could reject electors from certain states in order to deny Joseph R. Biden Jr. a majority of the Electoral College vote.\", \"Mr. Eastman is reported to have participated in a briefing for nearly 300 state legislators, during which he told the group that it was their duty to \\u201cfix this, this egregious conduct, and make sure that we\\u2019re not putting in the White House some guy that didn\\u2019t get elected,\\u201d the committee said. He participated in the Jan. 5 meeting at the Willard Hotel and spoke at the rally on the Ellipse on Jan. 6 before the Capitol assault.\", \"Mr. Flynn attended a meeting in the Oval Office on Dec. 18 during which participants discussed seizing voting machines, declaring a national emergency, invoking certain national security emergency powers and continuing to spread the false message that the 2020 election had been tainted by widespread fraud, the committee said.\", \"It has also issued a subpoena for Bernard Kerik, the former New York police commissioner who reportedly participated in the Willard Hotel meeting and paid for rooms and suites in Washington hotels as he worked with Mr. Giuliani to promote baseless litigation and \\u201cStop the Steal\\u201d efforts, the committee said.\"]","href_hash":"6c27ab7240d911ec888609cf38cb383a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6c27ab7240d911ec888609cf38cb383a"}},
