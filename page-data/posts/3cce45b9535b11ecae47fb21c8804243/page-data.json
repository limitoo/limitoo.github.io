A model inmate, he is eligible for parole — but only if he expresses remorse for a crime he says he did not commit.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-02T10:34:08.000Z","content":"[\"When Joseph Gordon, a 78-year-old man who has spent nearly three decades in prison for murder, went before the New York State parole board in March, among the letters supporting his bid for freedom was an extraordinary appeal.\", \"In addition to endorsements from corrections officers, civilian prison employees and a psychiatric social worker (who wrote that Mr. Gordon had changed the lives of many mentally ill prisoners), was a letter from a former superintendent at Fishkill Correctional Facility, in Beacon, N.Y. The superintendent, Leroy Fields, noted that in his more than 37 years as a corrections official, Mr. Gordon was only the second inmate he had ever recommended for release. Joseph Gordon, he wrote, has \\u201cthe character and moral compass to return to society as a productive member of his community.\\u201d\", \"The parole board remained unpersuaded. \\u201cYour release at this time is not compatible with the welfare of society,\\u201d the panel ruled, \\u201cand would so deprecate the serious nature of your crime as to undermine respect for the law.\\u201d It was the fifth parole denial Mr. Gordon had received since 2017, when he completed the minimum term of his sentence of 25 years to life in prison.\", \"In their decisions, board members focused chiefly on a single and apparently unforgivable flaw: He insists he is innocent of the crime that sent him to prison. Mr. Gordon, who is Black, was convicted of the 1991 murder of a white Westchester County doctor. His refusal to admit guilt, the parole panels ruled, showed that he lacked remorse for his crime.\", \"It is a conundrum faced by scores of prisoners who insist they\\u2019re not guilty. \\u201cThe board expects them to accept responsibility and express remorse,\\u201d said Michelle Lewin, executive director of the Parole Preparation Project. \\u201cPeople who maintain their innocence remain in an impossible situation.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gordon\\u2019s situation may be more impossible than most. He admits that after Dr. Daniel Pack, a 38-year-old neurologist with a wife and two young children, was shot to death in the basement of Mr. Gordon\\u2019s home in Elmsford, N.Y., he covered up the murder. He admits to hiding the body in a remote wooded area in Putnam County and ditching the doctor\\u2019s car in a New Jersey parking lot. But he insists that he did not kill Dr. Pack. He has long hesitated to say who did and why.\", \"\\u201cThe person that committed the murder was young, very young at that time, and I did what I did in order to protect that person,\\u201d he said at his first appearance before the board, in 2017. \\u201cI was led to believe it was an unwanted sexual encounter,\\u201d he added, \\u201cand that\\u2019s the end of that part of it for me, because I\\u2019m not going to disparage Dr. Pack. I\\u2019m not going to try in any way to sully his reputation.\\u201d\", \"Citing Mr. Gordon\\u2019s \\u201clack of full disclosure,\\u201d the board rejected him. At his next hearing, and for the first time in more than 25 years, he personally identified the shooter: It was his son, Chad, he said, who was just 16 at the time. The hearing transcript shows that he moaned, \\u201cOh, God,\\u201d as he told how he had returned home to find that Chad had shot Dr. Pack during an argument over a secret sexual relationship between them. He didn\\u2019t call the police because of fear of what could befall his son in prison. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t trust to do that,\\u201d he said at his March hearing. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t trust the system, society. I didn\\u2019t trust any of it. All I know is I wanted to take care of my son.\\u201d\", \"He voiced regret for the suffering endured by the doctor\\u2019s family. \\u201cTo this day I am sorry that he died,\\u201d he said of Dr. Pack. \\u201cThe pain that this caused his wife is unimaginable. I can\\u2019t even speak to it. All I can say to you is that I am sorry. I can\\u2019t change it. If I could, I would. I have tried to do everything in here that I could.\\u201d\", \"At each hearing, commissioners cited the jury\\u2019s verdict at his 1993 trial, where Mr. Gordon was convicted of shooting Dr. Pack during what prosecutors said was a fight over thousands of dollars they had invested together in rare baseball cards. Parole commissioners quoted Judge John Sweeny Jr.\\u2019s comments at sentencing that Mr. Gordon\\u2019s defense had offered \\u201ca concocted story of a homosexual argument \\u2026 that underscored the coldblooded and ruthless nature of this crime.\\u201d As he sent Mr. Gordon to prison, the judge told him he \\u201cdid not deserve to walk free in society ever again.\\u201d\", \"These days Mr. Gordon walks with a slight shuffle. Guards at Fishkill refer to him as \\u201cold man Gordon.\\u201d He is on his second pacemaker and spent several weeks in the hospital last winter. A short, trim man, he still carries some of the military bearing he acquired while serving two combat tours with the Air Force in Vietnam.\", \"The military taught him computer skills, and in civilian life he found work at large corporations. While living in California in the 1970s, he married a woman and had a son. They separated when the child was not yet 2. Mr. Gordon moved back east and settled in Elmsford, where he grew up. Chad remained with his mother in California, visiting his dad on holidays.\", \"Mr. Gordon began trading baseball cards, he said, in a bid to draw closer to his son, who was a fan. In 1991, however, Chad forged a grade on his school report card, and his parents decided he should live with his father for a while. Mr. Gordon enrolled him in a Catholic high school and put him to work in the afternoons at the sports memorabilia shop he operated in Rockland County. It was on one of those afternoons, Dec. 20, 1991, Mr. Gordon said in an interview at the prison, that he asked his son to wait at home to hand off a package of money and cards to Dr. Pack, with whom he had been investing in collectible baseball cards over the previous year.\", \"After dropping off his son at the house, Mr. Gordon, recalling the story he told the parole board, said he drove to his shop to find several anguished messages on his answering machine from Chad begging him to come home. He raced back to find his son in the basement, Dr. Pack\\u2019s body nearby. \\u201cChad couldn\\u2019t talk,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNeither could I.\\u201d His actions over the next hours, he said, were driven by panic over what would happen to his son if he was arrested. \\u201cI saw him going through every ugly scene in every prison movie I\\u2019d ever watched,\\u201d he said. He remembers also thinking that while his son couldn\\u2019t handle prison, an ex-soldier might be able to.\", \"Though his lawyers would outright accuse Chad of killing the doctor at the trial, Mr. Gordon had never wanted to say it out loud himself. Arrested and charged with murder, Mr. Gordon refused to take the stand. \\u201cI was not going to be compelled to testify against my son,\\u201d he explained. \\u201cI was not going to put my son in prison.\\u201d\", \"The prosecution presented the case as a simple fight over money. District Attorney James Rooney argued that on the day he was killed, Dr. Pack had gone to Mr. Gordon\\u2019s house to confront him over some $70,000 he had invested in baseball cards. Dr. Pack, the prosecutor said, \\u201cnever got a penny\\u201d from his investment. Although there was no evidence that the men had previously quarreled, Mr. Rooney said that rather than pay him back, Mr. Gordon killed him that day in his own home.\", \"Testimony confirmed that the doctor was killed in Mr. Gordon\\u2019s basement, where fragments from Dr. Pack\\u2019s eyeglasses were found. The one shred of forensic evidence at odds with the prosecution\\u2019s account was the presence of a small amount of semen that an autopsy found in Dr. Pack\\u2019s mouth. At the time, however, the amount was too small to determine the source. The most likely explanation, the district attorney told the jury, was that the semen had been deposited there by \\u201cthe last person to see Dr. Pack alive\\u201d \\u2014 meaning the defendant \\u2014 in a bizarre bid to confuse investigators.\", \"But the most powerful witness against Mr. Gordon was his son.\", \"He had been stunned to learn his son was testifying against him. \\u201cChad was scared,\\u201d Mr. Gordon said in the interview. \\u201cHe forgot who his father was, and that his father would never allow anything to hurt him.\\u201d\", \"On the witness stand, Chad said that on the day Dr. Pack was killed, his father picked him up at school at 2:30 and dropped him off at the store. He said he worked there and at a nearby food stand until late that night, as his father came and went several times. He arrived home to find police officers looking for Dr. Pack.\", \"Over the next few days, he told the jury, his father repainted the basement floor and installed new carpeting in the trunk of his car, where an odor like \\u201cold meat\\u201d lingered. He said his father told him to lie to the police about Mr. Gordon\\u2019s whereabouts on the day of the murder, as well as about a pistol Mr. Gordon kept in the house. The gun was never found, but the police maintained it was the murder weapon.\", \"Representing Mr. Gordon was William Kunstler, the fiery radical attorney, and his associate, Ron Kuby. The lawyers were recruited by local civil rights activists who feared that, as a Black man accused of killing a white man, Mr. Gordon wouldn\\u2019t receive a fair trial. Mr. Gordon said his lawyers assured him that they could question Chad about the killing without putting the son in legal jeopardy. That would allow the jury to hear an alternative explanation for the murder, the lawyers said.\", \"In cross-examining Chad Gordon, Mr. Kunstler attempted what he called \\u201ca Perry Mason\\u201d: abruptly and loudly accusing the witness of shooting the doctor. \\u201cYou know whose sperm was in Dr. Pack\\u2019s mouth, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d he demanded. \\u201cIt was yours, wasn\\u2019t it?\\u201d The teenager denied it, but Mr. Kunstler pressed on: \\u201cWill you now tell the jury the truth? Who murdered Dr. Pack? It was you, wasn\\u2019t it?\\u201d\", \"Before leaving the witness stand in tears, Chad angrily repeated his denial. \\u201cThis is an outrage,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI did not kill Dr. Pack.\\u201d\", \"The jury deliberated for a day before finding Mr. Gordon guilty. Reached in California, where he lives, Chad Gordon said he still believed in his father\\u2019s guilt and denied any involvement in Dr. Pack\\u2019s death. \\u201cMy father is a sociopath,\\u201d he said before hanging up. His mother did not respond to messages. Mr. Kunstler died in 1995. \\u201cI always believed a terrible injustice was done in Joseph Gordon\\u2019s case,\\u201d Mr. Kuby said.\", \"In prison, Mr. Gordon sought repeatedly to have the semen analyzed using new genetic tests. In 1996, three years after his conviction, an article about his appeals caught the eye of a woman who had lived across the street from Mr. Gordon at the time of the murder. The neighbor, Elizabeth Deerr, said that she had not told her story to the police at the time because her mother-in-law, whose house she lived in, warned her not to get involved.\", \"In an affidavit filed with the court in December 1996, she said that at about 3:30 on the afternoon of the murder, as she was watching her children play outside, she saw Mr. Gordon drop off his son at his home, then drive away. Fifteen minutes later, she saw a \\u201cwhite fancy car\\u201d pull up. A tall, thin white man emerged and was met by Chad Gordon at the entrance of the home. Ms. Deerr saw Chad directing the man to the back of the house. She never saw Chad or the man leave the house or Mr. Gordon return.\", \"Citing the affidavit, Mr. Gordon filed a new appeal. The judge who had presided at the trial denied it. In an interview, Ms. Deerr, who is white, said she regretted not coming forward earlier. \\u201cI always hoped he would get another trial and I could tell my story,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThings could\\u2019ve been different for Joe.\\u201d\", \"In 2003, Mr. Gordon asked the Innocence Project, the nonprofit organization specializing in DNA analysis, to take up his case. The project\\u2019s lawyers pressed the Putnam County district attorney\\u2019s office to allow experts to examine the semen. The office eventually agreed, but repeated tests failed to produce results. It wasn\\u2019t until 2015 that conclusive findings emerged: Neither Mr. Gordon nor his son was the source of the semen. Experts also determined that it could not have been deposited after Dr. Pack\\u2019s death.\", \"To Mr. Gordon and his lawyers at the Innocence Project, the new findings added credibility to his assertion that Dr. Pack had sex with men and disproved the assertion by the prosecutor at his trial that Mr. Gordon had placed the semen there himself.\", \"Mr. Gordon\\u2019s persistence impressed Christopher York, the former chief assistant at the Putnam County district attorney\\u2019s office, who handled the requests for the DNA testing. Mr. York, a career prosecutor, wrote to the parole board in January. He took no position on Mr. Gordon\\u2019s guilt or innocence, he wrote, but added, \\u201cIn my view it would be inappropriate to deny Mr. Gordon \\u2014 or any other applicant \\u2014 release from prison for asserting his or her actual innocence.\\u201d\", \"Parole boards, however, regard assertions of innocence with skepticism. \\u201cThere is a very strong presumption that claiming innocence is a sign of denial,\\u201d said Daniel S. Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University who wrote a 2008 study titled \\u201cThe Innocent Prisoner\\u2019s Dilemma.\\u201d\", \"One solution to that dilemma, Mr. Medwed\\u2019s study found, is to falsely admit guilt. John Ramsey, a Brooklyn man who spent 33 years in prison after his conviction for a 1981 murder during the robbery of a drug den, claims he did just that. Mr. Ramsey repeatedly told the parole board that he was innocent, having been convicted on the word of a single witness who admitted he had spent the day smoking angel dust. After being denied parole six times, Mr. Ramsey reversed course and was released in 2015.\", \"\\u201cI just admitted it,\\u201d Mr. Ramsey said. \\u201cI was never getting out if I say it wasn\\u2019t me,\\u201d he said.\", \"Kevin Smith, who served 27 years for murder, did the same. At his initial parole hearing, Mr. Smith insisted that he had been wrongly convicted of a 1984 shooting in Brooklyn. He changed his position after his mother fell ill. \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t stomach saying I did it, at first,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut I went back before the board and made a false admission.\\u201d Approved for parole, he returned home in 2012 in time to see his mother before she died.\", \"Since their release, both Mr. Ramsey and Mr. Smith have tried to get their original convictions overturned. Their parole board confessions have complicated those efforts. In 2019, a Brooklyn Supreme Court judge dismissed Mr. Ramsey\\u2019s request for a new trial, citing his admission of guilt to the board. He is appealing the decision.\", \"Mr. Gordon said he always knew his story would be difficult for the parole board to accept, and he initially considered falsely admitting guilt. \\u201cMy plan was to go in to the board and say I did it, take full responsibility,\\u201d he said. He rejected the idea after being warned against it by a doctor with whom he worked in programs for mentally ill prisoners. \\u201cHe said, \\u2018That would be a lie, and you don\\u2019t lie,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Gordon said.\", \"The parole boards have cited \\u201cextensive and vehement community opposition\\u201d to Mr. Gordon\\u2019s release. Dr. Pack\\u2019s widow, Margit Pack, has steadily advocated for Mr. Gordon to remain in prison. \\u201cDaniel Pack will never get out of the grave, and I hope Joseph Gordon never gets out of jail,\\u201d Ms. Pack said after the conviction.\", \"The current district attorney of Putnam County, Robert Tendy, who took office in 2016, has also strenuously opposed his release. Last year, Mr. Tendy wrote to the board saying that he had reviewed the case file and concluded that Mr. Gordon was involved in \\u201ca continuing charade.\\u201d Mr. Gordon, the district attorney wrote, used \\u201ca na\\u00efve doctor as a cash cow \\u2014 scamming him out of tens of thousands of dollars,\\u201d and then killing him when confronted about the scheme.\", \"In an interview, the district attorney said that he was most disturbed by Mr. Gordon\\u2019s explanation of the crime. \\u201cThe most offensive thing to me,\\u201d he said, \\u201cis that he is trying to blame it on his own son and also trying to turn Dr. Pack into a child molester.\\u201d Mr. Gordon remains a threat to society, he said, despite his advanced age. \\u201cIt is not just the physical threat,\\u201d Mr. Tendy said. \\u201cIt is a threat that this person will be given a soapbox to preach his innocence and become part of the ever-growing movement to undermine the justice system. There is a lot of it going around these days.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gordon said he had no interest in mounting any soapboxes. This month, he faces his sixth parole board hearing, and he will tell the panel his plan: if released, he will live quietly in the Putnam County home of his current wife, whom he married more than 20 years ago after meeting her while she was teaching prisoners. He will do part-time community work if he\\u2019s able, he said.\", \"In the meantime, he is working as a grievance counselor, representing prisoners on medical and other issues. \\u201cWhat do I want to do, lay around all day doing nothing?\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t work.\\u201d\", \"As he sat talking to a visitor recently, a passing officer gave the prisoner a rare seal of approval. \\u201cThis guy\\u2019s top notch,\\u201d the guard said, gesturing at Mr. Gordon.\"]","href_hash":"3cce45b9535b11ecae47fb21c8804243"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3cce45b9535b11ecae47fb21c8804243"}},
