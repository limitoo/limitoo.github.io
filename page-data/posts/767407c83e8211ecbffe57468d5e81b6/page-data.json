Court officials cast a wide net, setting up an intake center at a gymnasium in a local park, where hundreds of potential jurors were given an initial screening. Eventually, a pool of 65 was assembled, to be whittled to 12 jurors and four alternates.\", \"Annie Deets, a public defender and adjunct law professor at Georgia State and Emory Universities, said she had seen jury selection completed in as little as a day or two and, in some cases, up to a week. The length of the process in the Arbery case, she said, was a rarity.\", \"The task of finding an impartial jury for a case involving three separate defendants was already difficult \\u2014 and the challenges were compounded by the fact that Mr. Arbery\\u2019s killing was among the most explosive murder cases in South Georgia in decades.
