How can we have different consequences for different kinds of bigotry or incitement?\\\" the New York Democrat wrote. \\\"This should be treated equally and consistently. Incite against a member and you're stripped. End of story.

Boebert referred to Omar as a member of the \\\"Jihad Squad\\\" and suggested that she could have been a terrorist while describing an encounter the two lawmakers had in an elevator.\", \"The controversy was heightened after a phone call between Omar and Boebert, which Omar described as \\\"unproductive\\\" and claimed Boebert only doubled down on her remarks.
