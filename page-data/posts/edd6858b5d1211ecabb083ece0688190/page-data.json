A midlife crisis sees an anxious Marty Markowitz finally attend therapy sessions with Dr Ike Herschkopf, who quickly ropes Marty into his web of lies and deceit.\", \"Why you'll like it: It's easy to label the characters in Succession as just straight-up terrible people. But one of the reasons we can't look away from their cutthroat world is because the show humanises these morally dubious people. The Shrink Next Door has this same tone but in reverse.

But almost 20 years later, Succession shares that similar unstable cinematography, giving the audience a fly-on-the-wall insight, which only adds to its storytelling.\", \"A cracking quote: \\\"Why shouldn't I go for Toni?
