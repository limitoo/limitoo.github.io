It is still possible for Verstappen to win the Drivers' Championship but Hamilton's Mercedes to win the Constructors' Championship.\", \"Since the two drivers are tied at the top, whoever finishes the race higher on Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix will win the 2021 Formula One World Championship. If both drivers fail to finish, Verstappen will take home the trophy with a better head-to-head record of wins.\", \"While both will be desperate to win, what would a victory mean for both drivers' careers on Sunday?\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948507/lewis-hamilton-max-verstappen.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Hamilton and Verstappen go head to head in a winner-takes-all contest this SUnday at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What If Max Verstappen Wins?</div>\", \"If Verstappen were to finish ahead of Hamilton on Sunday, he would be lifting his first FIA Formula One World Drivers Championship Trophy.\", \"Verstappen would no doubt be a national hero in the Netherlands, becoming the first ever Dutch winner of the Formula One Drivers' Championship, and he'd be among the youngest too. At 24 years and 73 days old, he'd become the fourth youngest champion in history, behind Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton (2008) and Sebastian Vettel.\", \"Even if he doesn't win, Verstappen surely has a long successful career ahead of him, finishing third in 2019 and 2020, fourth in 2018 and sixth in his debut season back in 2017.\", \"He's guaranteed at least a second place finish on Sunday so his results are still heading in the right direction, but he has a very real chance of usurping current world champion Hamilton.\", \"If Verstappen were able to bring home the trophy for himself and the Constructors' Championship for Red Bull Racing-Honda then it would bag the team a massive $66 million according to British newspaper The Independent.\", \"The prize money doesn't filter down to the drivers as they get paid a salary from their teams, but a Drivers' Championship on the resume would surely earn Verstappen a hefty new contract.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What If Lewis Hamilton Wins?</div>\", \"Throughout the season it was looking unlikely that Hamilton would be in contention for another Drivers' Championship but he's fought his way back up the leaderboard.\", \"Last week he and Verstappen were exchanging the lead in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix and Hamilton just held on to win the race.

He'd have to race for another decade if he wants to be first on that list though as Argentina's Juan Manuel Fangio won at the age of 46 in 1957.\", \"If Hamilton and Bottas are able to bring home the Constructors' Championship for Mercedes, it would be their eighth victory in a row, tenth overall.\", \"Another F1 World Drivers' Championship may increase Hamilton's already considerable wealth. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Hamilton is currently worth $285 million a year, on an annual salary of $50 million, 40 million of which comes from Mercedes.
