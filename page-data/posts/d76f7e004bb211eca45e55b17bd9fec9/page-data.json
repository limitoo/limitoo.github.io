She wrote: \\\"I tried hiding you from the world early on but couldn't. You were meant to be seen \\u2026 still haven't grasped the fact that you actually left me Baby.\\\"\", \"Fowler was six years old, according to the Instagram page. Many users responded to express their condolences. His viral video can be seen below.\", \"Autoimmune enteropathy is a rare condition that occurs when the body's own immune system attacks itself. It is most common in infants but it can also occur in adults.\", \"A lot of what is known about the condition has been gathered from case reports, and so more research about it is needed, according to a study published in the journal Current Gastroenterology Reports in 2012.\", \"What is known is that the condition can irritate the lining of the intestine and can lead to diarrhea and affect the patient's ability to absorb food and nutrients, according to Cincinnati Children's Hospital.\", \"People with the condition may also need to get fluids via an IV drip.\", \"Sometimes the body may also attack itself in other places, including the thyroid and other glands.\", \"Other symptoms associated with autoimmune enteropathy are poor weight gain and weight loss, decreased urine output, frequent infections, and skin rash.\", \"The condition is usually treated with medicines that work to suppress the immune system, and the children may also be put on a special diet, Cincinnati Children's Hospital notes. The disease is considered rare in the U.S.\", \"According to a fundraiser on GoFundMe set up for Fowler in April this year, the young boy was diagnosed with the condition in 2015 and was hospitalized \\\"a countless number of times\\\" and had to have \\\"over 25 surgeries\\\".\", \"As of Monday morning ET the fundraiser had gained just under $65,000.\", \"A recent donor commented: \\\"Rest in Peace beautiful Antwain!
