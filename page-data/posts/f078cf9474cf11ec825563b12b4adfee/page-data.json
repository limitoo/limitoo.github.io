Two days after the riot, Twitter permanently banned Trump, citing \\\"the risk of further incitement of violence.\\\" Facebook soon followed suit, although the Oversight Board has ordered the company to review the decision by 2023.\", \"In a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Thompson mentioned the company's Civic Integrity team, whose mission was to counter election misinformation but was disbanded before the January 6 attack.\", \"\\\"Facebook disbanded the Civic Integrity team that had focused on risks to election including misinformation, and reduced the application of tools used to restrain the spread of violent content,\\\" Thompson writes, adding, \\\"despite repeated and specific requests for documents to these matters, the Select Committee still has not received these materials.\\\"\", \"It's a change of tune for the chairman of the committee, who said in an October interview on \\\"Face the Nation\\\" that \\\"at this point, Facebook is working with us to provide the necessary information we requested.\\\"\", \"Representatives for Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News for this story.\", \"The Select Committee wants Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube to turn over records about how it developed, implemented, and reviewed its content moderation and other policies that may have affected the events on January 6th.\", \"In a letter to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Thompson writes that the company has \\\"significant undisclosed information\\\" critical to the committee's investigation.\", \"\\\"YouTube was a platform for significant communications by its users that were relevant to the planning and execution of the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol,\\\" Thompson writes in his letter to Pichai.\", \"Thompson also said Steve Bannon, who once served as chief strategist for Trump and spread lies that the results of the 2020 election were illegitimate, live-streamed his podcasts on YouTube in the days before and after the attack on the Capitol.\", \"\\\"To this day, YouTube is a platform on which user video spread misinformation about the election,\\\" Thompson writes.\", \"Alphabet did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.\", \"Twitter, which declined to comment for this story, was also scolded by Thompson for allegedly allowing high-profile accounts to use the platform \\\"for communications amplifying allegations of election fraud.\\\" Thompson said Twitter has not produced documents relating to warnings the company received that its platform was being used to plan or incite violence on January 6, 2021. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"Twitter has failed to produce any documents that fully explain either its decision to suspend President Trump's account on January 8, 2021, or any other decisions the company made regarding President Trump's account relating to the events of January 6th,\\\" Thompson wrote in a letter to Twitter's new CEO Parag Agarwal.\", \"A spokesperson for Reddit confirmed to CBS News that the company has \\\"received the subpoena and will continue to work with the committee on their requests.\\\"\", \"Thompson wrote to Reddit CEO Steven Huffman that the \\\"subreddit\\\" community \\\"r/The_Donald\\\" grew significantly on Reddit, adding that the users of the group discussed, and planned actions related to the January 6 attack.\", \"In August, the select committee sent requests for records to 15 social media companies and set a two-week deadline for the companies to respond.\", \"Thompson said Wednesday the committee has issued about 85 subpoenas, including Trump's allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege. Two top Trump allies,\\u00a0Bannon and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, have been held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas, and the Justice Department has charged Bannon. Both said they are following instructions from Trump, who has claimed executive privilege.\\u00a0\", \"The House select committee, created by Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this year, is investigating the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming Mr. Biden's victory. Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of hundreds more. Trump, who encouraged his supporters to \\\"walk over\\\" to the Capitol during the Stop the Steal rally, was impeached by the House one week later for inciting the riot but was later acquitted by the Senate.\", \"CBS News reporter covering the intersection between politics and tech.\"]","href_hash":"f078cf9474cf11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f078cf9474cf11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
