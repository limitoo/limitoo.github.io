Tomorrow\\u2019s Thanksgiving, and whether you\\u2019re celebrating at home, away or not at all, it\\u2019s likely that this year\\u2019s holiday looks different from last year\\u2019s. The vaccine\\u2019s changed the options for many of us, opening up possibilities for family gatherings and Friendsgivings. As with everything these days, we\\u2019re figuring it out as we go, negotiating new situations awkwardly (maybe) but with compassion (hopefully).\", \"I find myself this year savoring the questions that, pre-pandemic, were the stuff of polite small-talk: What are your plans for the holidays? Doing anything fun this weekend? Now, it feels like a privilege to even ask such questions, to live in a world where plans for the future are being made. Last week, I asked what you\\u2019re doing for Thanksgiving. Here\\u2019s what some of you said. (Responses have been edited for length and clarity.)\", \"What are you watching, listening to, cooking or reading over the holiday? Tell us: athome@nytimes.com. Be sure to include your full name and location and we might feature your response in a future newsletter. We\\u2019re At Home and Away. We\\u2019ll read every letter sent.
