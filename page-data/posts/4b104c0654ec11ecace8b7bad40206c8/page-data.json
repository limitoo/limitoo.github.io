She began specializing in wedding cakes when William Greenberg Jr., an Upper East Side baker in business since 1946, passed orders along to her. (He didn\\u2019t do wedding cakes.)\", \"She founded Sylvia Weinstock Cakes in the early \\u201980s in a four-story townhouse in Manhattan\\u2019s TriBeCa neighborhood, where she also lived. Ms. Weinstock had three daughters with her husband, Benjamin Weinstock, who died in 2018.\", \"With a deep dislike for fondant, she was among the first to perfect and include sugar flowers, edible pieces of art that quickly became her signature. \\u201cThe first cake I sold was a single-layer cake filled with sugar flowers,\\u201d she said in a 2019 interview. \\u201cIt was for a private party at the Carlyle Hotel. Then I went to two-tier cakes. The tallest I\\u2019ve made was 10 feet and had thousands of flowers.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Weinstock was a fierce businesswoman with a baker\\u2019s understanding for the complexity of taste paired with an artist\\u2019s eye for detail. Over the last 35 years, she created thousands of cakes, for clients who included Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, Billy Joel, Mariah Carey and Sof\\u00eda Vergara. She also served as a judge on the Netflix series \\u201cNailed it!\\u201d and appeared on \\u201cGossip Girl,\\u201d on the CW, and \\u201cTop Chef.\\u201d\", \"Four couples who worked with Ms. Weinstock remember what it meant to have their cake designed by the slight woman with the big, black, round glasses and an even bigger personality.\", \"Their Wedding Aug. 25, 2012, at Sylvester Manor, a property owned by the Williamson family on Shelter Island, N.Y.\", \"\\u201cI was coming from D.C. and my family wasn\\u2019t with me,\\u201d Ms. Hailey said of when she met with Ms. Weinstock for a cake tasting. \\u201cThe second Sylvia walked in the room she sensed I was sad about being on my own and made me feel like I was with a family member.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Weinstock designed the couple\\u2019s cake with lace swags to match Ms. Hailey\\u2019s Ines Di Santo dress; daisies as a nod to her alma mater, Miss Porter\\u2019s School in Farmington, Conn.; and greenery highlighting the boxwood that grew throughout the Williamson family property. \\u201cShe understood romance and love and put it in her cakes,\\u201d said Ms. Hailey, the chief executive of Vote.org, a nonprofit platform that provides online voter guides for each state.\", \"Ms. Weinstock also gave the couple life advice. \\u201cShe was so wise when it came to love and family,\\u201d Ms. Hailey said. \\u201cShe was warm and kind with a no-nonsense personality. She was also an advocate for women.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Hailey added that, to this day, the wedding cake Ms. Weinstock made remains a topic of conversation. \\u201cWe still have the handcrafted flowers that she created. My mother-in-law loved them so much that she made a permanent arrangement for us. All these years later we\\u2019re still talking about it,\\u201d she said.\", \"Their Wedding Dec. 17, 2016, at The Breakers hotel in Palm Beach, Fla.\", \"In the fall of 2016, Mr. Gellman and Ms. Moncrief flew from Boca Raton, Fla., to New York to meet Ms. Weinstock. \\u201cI thought we were insane to fly to see a woman who was called \\u2018the godmother of cakes,\\u2019\\u201d said Mr. Gellman, the chief executive of Vertical Bridge, a private owner of cellphone towers. \\u201cBut once we met her, tasted her cakes and talked to her, you understood how important she was.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gellman remembered being impressed by the walls in Ms. Weinstock\\u2019s office/work space, which were covered with photos from weddings she had made cakes for.\", \"The couple chose a small, three-tier buttercream cake complete with her moniker flowers. \\u201cThe cake moment is important,\\u201d Mr. Gellman said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s intimate because it\\u2019s about taking care of each other as you feed a piece to your spouse. That\\u2019s what our time with Sylvia was like. Intimate and caring. She had a desire to connect with us so she could put that in our cake.\\u201d\", \"The couple took home the top of the cake so they could eat it on their first wedding anniversary. But because of a hurricane in 2017, they went without power for a week and \\u201cwe lost the cake and the moment of celebrating our anniversary,\\u201d Mr. Gellman said. \\u201cThat was really sad. The cake meant a lot to us. So did Sylvia. She was part of our wedding experience.\\u201d\", \"Their Wedding Sept. 21, 2013, at 501 Union, an event space in Brooklyn.\", \"Anthony Luscia had met Ms. Weinstock in 2004 when he was a stylist and editor for Martha Stewart Living and Martha Stewart Weddings magazines. \\u201cShe was a creative genius who understood her clients and their stories,\\u201d said Mr. Luscia, who is now the director for events at Mama Farm, a bed-and-breakfast in Brookhaven, N.Y., owned by the actor Isabella Rossellini.\", \"The couple decided on twin wedding cakes. Mr. Luscia\\u2019s was a chocolate cake with chocolate icing and Mr. James\\u2019s was a peanut butter cake with chocolate icing. Both cakes were two feet tall with three tiers wrapped with gold Grecian-style leaves made of sugar.\", \"\\u201cThe leaves were a nod to Sylvia\\u2019s style of work because she knew I didn\\u2019t like flowers,\\u201d Mr. Luscia said. \\u201cI gave her some input and she surprised me, which is hard to do. I cried when I saw them.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cCakes are an iconic moment in a wedding,\\u201d Mr. Luscia added. The couple\\u2019s \\u201crepresented how we saw our lives and how we saw ourselves: equals, standing side by side as we got married,\\u201d he said.\", \"Ms. Weinstock attended the pair\\u2019s wedding as a guest, and later in the evening, before the cutting of the cake, she gave a speech. \\u201cShe was standing behind her cakes, wearing a long, dressy shirt\\u201d that was silver and black, Mr. Luscia said. \\u201cShe looked like a shining star. That\\u2019s who she was.\\u201d\", \"Their Wedding June 23, 1990, at the Pierre Hotel in New York. (The couple later divorced in 2018.)\", \"\\u201cOur wedding cake was extravagant, stunning and elegant. It was six or eight tiers with hundreds of blush and pale pink edible flowers \\u2014 peonies, roses and orchids \\u2014 that matched the color of my bridesmaids\\u2019 dresses,\\u201d said Ms. Brown, who raises funds for charitable organizations. \\u201cThe inside was chocolate with vanilla icing. The outside was all white.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Brown added, \\u201cThe cake was so tall that when it was wheeled out, it started to fall, but they caught it.\\u201d\", \"The cake\\u2019s brush with gravity came after an even bigger scare: Weeks before the wedding, Mr. Sweetwood had a rare carcinoid tumor in his lung removed, and the couple didn\\u2019t know if they would have to postpone.\", \"When the time came to cut the cake, Ms. Brown said, \\u201cTears were running down our faces. The cake signified that scary, bad times were past us and the start of everything sweet and beautiful was ahead.\\u201d\", \"At the end of the evening, all 370 of the couple\\u2019s guests received a mini replica of their cake that Ms. Weinstock had also created as a take-home gift.\"]","href_hash":"4b104c0654ec11ecace8b7bad40206c8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4b104c0654ec11ecace8b7bad40206c8"}},
