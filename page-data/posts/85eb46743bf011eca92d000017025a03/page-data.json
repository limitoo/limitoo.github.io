They will also be voting on five potential amendments to the State Constitution.\", \"Here are answers to questions you may have about voting.\", \"On Election Day, you can vote only at your designated polling place, which may differ from your early voting site. Check your polling site here.\", \"You can also call 1-866-VOTE-NYC (1-866-868-3692) \\u2014 or simply 311 \\u2014 to find your polling site.\", \"You can check your voting status and party registration on the New York State Board of Elections site. Once you enter your information, you will also see a preview of the ballot choices.\", \"If you cannot find your voter registration record, contact your county\\u2019s board of elections for assistance.\", \"Yes, Monday was the last day to get an absentee ballot. If you\\u2019ve already gotten one, it must be postmarked by Tuesday.\", \"Yes. But register to vote in future elections here.\", \"Anyone can bring their own interpreter to a polling site if needed, as long as the interpreter is not the voter\\u2019s employer or union representative.\", \"The Board of Elections provides interpreters and materials in Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Bengali at select sites, and interpreters are available in a wider array of languages at some sites through the Civic Engagement Commission. Here\\u2019s the full list of which interpreters are scheduled to be at different sites.\", \"The sites are supposed to be accessible to all voters, though a report earlier this year found many shortcomings in a survey of Manhattan locations. Voters who are visually impaired or have a disability that makes it difficult to use a pen can request ballot-marking devices that utilize audio, touch-screens, Braille and other modes.\", \"The state enacted a law in the spring restoring voting rights to people convicted of felonies who have been released on parole. People released on probation had generally already been allowed to vote. Those still incarcerated for felonies cannot vote.\", \"No. Ranked-choice voting is reserved for primary and special elections for city office.\", \"Turnout is expected to be low, and many have already cast their ballots in early voting or by mail. But never say never.\", \"No. You have the right to vote as long as you are in line by 9 p.m.\"]","href_hash":"85eb46743bf011eca92d000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"85eb46743bf011eca92d000017025a03"}},
