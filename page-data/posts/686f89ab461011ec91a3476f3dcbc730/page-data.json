When he was elected president, he resigned from his companies in order to avoid any potential conflicts of interest.\", \"However, he handed over the running of his businesses, including his hotels, to a company run by his children, Eric and Donald Trump Jr.\", \"The House Committee on Oversight and Reform has since been investigating if there were conflicts of interest after the General Services Administration (GSA) allowed the Trump International Hotel to maintain its lease on the Old Post Office building, which was awarded in 2013, when Trump became president.\", \"In 2019, an inspector general report alleged that lawyers for GSA \\\"ignored the Constitution\\\" when deciding to maintain the lease on the hotel.\", \"In a statement to The Wall Street Journal, a spokesperson said that the House committee would continue to investigate \\\"conflicts of interest and potential constitutional violations raised by Donald Trump's lease of this hotel from the federal government\\\" while he was president.\", \"\\\"That won't be fully resolved by selling off this hotel.\\\"\", \"Even before the pandemic hit, Trump Internal Hotel was already struggling financially.
