Vaid-Menon is a gender nonconforming artist, writer and comedian who uses their work to redefine beauty standards, examine colonialism and explore fluid identity. \\u201cThe word \\u2018artist\\u2019 is one of possibility, not constriction,\\u201d they said. \\u201cSo it means that I\\u2019m kind of ambivalent about form and I\\u2019m more invested in flow.\\u201d Mx. Vaid-Menon explores ideas through poetry and nonfiction, but also through fashion, virtual book clubs and live performances.\", \"Big Break: This summer, Mx. Vaid-Menon appeared on \\u201cMan Enough,\\u201d a podcast that explores what masculinity is; previous guests have included Shawn Mendes and Matthew McConaughey. In one memorable moment, Mx.

Vaid-Menon said. \\u201cSome of my favorite comedians are Black, Indigenous, people of color and trans people because we know that humor is not about levity.
