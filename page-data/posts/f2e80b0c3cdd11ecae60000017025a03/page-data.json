She decided to return in order to reconnect with her adopted daughter after she experienced issues transitioning back into life in Europe, French media reported.\", \"Her return troubled French and Malian authorities, who feared that she might encounter further danger back in the country where she was detained for years. An October 29 message to Malian police said that Petronin was traveling to the town of Sikasso, and authorities asked law enforcement to transport her back to Bamako, Mali's capital, if she was found, AP reported.\", \"\\\"Sophie [Petronin] is wanted by the gendarmerie.
