Disabled people were more likely than non-disabled to report they found barriers to accessing care during the lockdown period. Many disabled people chose not to try and access healthcare during the first lockdown. One of the reasons was not wanting to go to places where people get sick and concerns around catching COVID-19. Of those who did seek care, only around half of the participants received same or next-day care.\", \"The survey also highlighted issues with the overall quality of care that disabled people received.
