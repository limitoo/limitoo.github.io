We don't have that way of ritualising pain and grief.\\\"\", \"Organising those gatherings as the coronavirus runs rampant has been difficult, with more than a dozen staff off sick at Rachel Benns' funeral homes.\", \"Chapel staff, caterers and florists were also struggling with staff shortages, causing delays, she said.\", \"\\\"We've got funeral staff who are putting on a pinny and pouring the tea.\", \"\\\"I had a funeral the other day and the flowers were late arriving. The florist rang and said look, we booked and paid for them, I'm at the markets - I can see them but I can't get them because there aren't enough staff.\\\"\", \"The increase in the number of deaths caused by Covid-19 has led to a shortage of space in mortuaries overseas.\", \"Some district health boards have hired or bought refrigerated containers to store bodies if morgues and funeral homes run out of room.\", \"A number of funeral homes had installed three-phase power to run container storage, Benns said.\", \"\\\"Quite a few funeral homes have rather large refrigeration storage facilities already, but they would just be used more long term. A lot of deceased people are prepared, so they don't actually need refrigeration once we've looked after them,\\\" she said.\", \"Auckland company Lucentt supplies funeral homes with coffins, caskets, nameplates, crosses, mortuary equipment and embalming chemicals.\", \"General manager Mark Chaafe said while most products were New Zealand-made the company was waiting months for imports stuck at congested American ports.\", \"\\\"We've had a shipment there for five months, sitting on the wharf, we just managed to get it moved - that was embalming fluid. We've pretty much run out, so we'll be pleased to see that arriving,\\\" he said.\", \"Freight costs had soared by at least 300 percent, Chaafe said.\", \"Masterton craftsman Dean Taylor and his eight staff made about 70 solid pine coffins and caskets a week in a variety of finishes at Taylormade Furniture.\", \"\\\"They range from a raw pine, sanded finish to an oil, some of them just get a stain on them, right up to a piano gloss finish that you buff up like you'd buff up a car,\\\" he said.\", \"While demand remained steady, Taylor said supply and freight costs had spiked.\", \"\\\"One example of that is our paint or lacquer supplier. We're on our third price increase from them in about 10 months. The cost of that material is about 22 percent up,\\\" he said.\", \"Despite the expense, Taylor hoped people found solace in a send-off.\", \"\\\"There was some talk about whether you really needed one, but I think over those lockdown periods, not being able to have one has really driven home the value of a funeral, so that's been quite heartening,\\\" he said.\"]","href_hash":"47c3bf2aa57c11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"47c3bf2aa57c11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
