And I have tried my very best these past 22 years. There are no shortcuts to success on the field or in life.\", \"\\\"This is difficult for me to write, but here it goes: I am not going to make that competitive commitment anymore.

My teammates, coaches, fellow competitors, and fans deserve 100% of me, but right now, it's best I leave the field of play to the next generation of dedicated and committed athletes.\\\"\", \"-Reuters\"]","href_hash":"baabedd6839f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"baabedd6839f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
