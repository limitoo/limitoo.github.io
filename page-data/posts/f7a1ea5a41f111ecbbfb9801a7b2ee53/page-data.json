If you support your local farmers' market, you're also supporting more low-scale food agriculture which tends to be more kind to the Earth.\\\"\", \"Eat as seasonally as possible: \\\"If you're eating tomatoes from the UK that aren't in season, then you know they've been grown in some huge greenhouse that uses a massive amount of resources to basically fake the weather. So you're using a massive amount of heat energy to grow the tomatoes out of season.\\\"\", \"Think about packaging: \\\"There are zero-waste shops where you buy unpackaged food. But you can also go to the supermarket, and make better choices by buying unpackaged fruit and vegetables, or opting for cans and cardboard that are widely recycled instead of plastic.

So the cost-per-use is a lot lower.\\\"\", \"Think about your menstrual products: \\\"Tampons and pads are single-use items, and not everyone disposes of them properly. The big change you can make is going to a menstrual cup, which is a silicone cup that catches all the blood and can be reused each month - they're not as scary as they sound. There's also menstrual underwear these days which is a lot more sustainable.\\\"\", \"Big brands can also be eco-friendly: \\\"A lot of the big beauty brands are really taking inspiration from the vegan environmental movement.
