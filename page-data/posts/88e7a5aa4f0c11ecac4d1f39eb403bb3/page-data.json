It seems to spread rapidly,\\\" Biden told reporters in Nantucket, Massachusetts, on Friday, according to CBS News.\", \"After a briefing with his chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci and the COVID response team, Biden decided to restrict travel from South Africa and seven other countries starting November 29 to curb the spread of the new variant, according to a statement by the White House.\", \"The air travel restrictions apply to Eswatini, Mozambique, Malawi, Lesotho, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, and Botswana. Most non-U.S. citizens who were in those countries during the past 14 days will be banned from entering the U.S., Reuters reported on Friday.\", \"No details were revealed about how long the bans will be in place.\", \"\\\"Get your booster shot now, so you can have this additional protection during the holiday season,\\\" Biden urged fully vaccinated Americans.
