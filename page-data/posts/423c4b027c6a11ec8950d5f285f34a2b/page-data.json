And so am I.\", \"Daniel FinkBeverly Hills, Calif.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Ross Douthat makes a reasonable point about the precise meaning of \\u201ccivil war.\\u201d However, on Jan. 6, 2021, a large number of seemingly \\u201cnormal\\u201d Americans violently stormed the Capitol, the seat of American democracy. Since then, a shockingly large percentage of Americans continue to find just cause in this event, and the vast majority of one of our two governing political parties continues to quietly condone it, as does a sizable tranche of our media.\", \"There is clearly a \\u201cnew normal\\u201d at work here, and it is tectonic. Maybe it doesn\\u2019t meet the definition of low-grade \\u201ccivil war\\u201d \\u2014 yet!
