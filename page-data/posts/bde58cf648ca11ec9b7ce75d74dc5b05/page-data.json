Baseball writers agreed, unanimously giving him the A.L.’s Most Valuable Player Award.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-18T23:54:06.000Z","content":"[\"Shohei Ohtani was extraordinary this season. Ohtani, the Los Angeles Angels\\u2019 two-way star, smashed 46 home runs, drove in 100 runs and posted a .965 on-base plus slugging percentage, trailing only Toronto\\u2019s Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in the American League. As if that wasn\\u2019t impressive enough, Ohtani was also his team\\u2019s best starting pitcher, amassing a 3.18 earned run average and 156 strikeouts in 130 \\u2153 innings over 23 starts.\", \"On Thursday, Ohtani\\u2019s historic efforts were rewarded with the A.L. Most Valuable Player Award. He joined the former Seattle Mariners star outfielder Ichiro Suzuki, the 2001 A.L. M.V.P., as the only Japanese players in Major League Baseball history to earn the award.\", \"Ohtani received all 30 of the first-place votes for the award, which is presented annually by the Baseball Writers\\u2019 Association of America. He beat out his fellow finalists, Guerrero, who received 29 second-place votes, and second baseman Marcus Semien, also of the Blue Jays, who received 24 third-place votes.\", \"Bryce Harper, a star outfielder for the Philadelphia Phillies, was named the N.L. M.V.P.\", \"Few people beyond Ohtani\\u2019s inner circle may be happier about his achievement than Tomoyuki and Kaoru Iwase. They have never formally met Ohtani, 27, but they have watched him play perhaps more than anyone outside of his family.\", \"This season alone, Kaoru attended 136 Angels games to watch Ohtani play (not including the Home Run Derby in Denver in July). Her husband, Tomoyuki, said he attended roughly 10 fewer games. The superfans used to fly to Japan to see him play for his former team, the Nippon Ham Fighters in Nippon Professional Baseball. Tomoyuki, 49, estimated they went to 15 different M.L.B. stadiums to see Ohtani play this season. Kaoru, 38, posts about the travels on her Instagram page.\", \"They own roughly 300 Ohtani memorabilia items, from his Ham Fighters and Angels jerseys to his bobbleheads to balls he tossed into the crowd. (No autographs, though.) A few years ago, they had a wedding photo shoot at Angel Stadium while donning \\u2014 naturally \\u2014 Ohtani jerseys. They used to live a 30-minute drive away from the stadium in Anaheim but last year moved to an apartment a five-minute walk from the ballpark.\", \"\\u201cEven in the off-season, we take a walk to Angel Stadium,\\u201d Tomoyuki said. He added laughing, \\u201cIt\\u2019s our main home.\\u201d\", \"So when Ohtani was announced as the A.L. M.V.P., the moment meant more \\u2014 to the sport, to Japanese baseball fans and others \\u2014 than simply the capstone of a magnificent campaign on the field.\", \"Throughout his career, even back in Japan, Ohtani has continually faced skepticism over his ability to remain a two-way player. It is hard enough being an everyday hitter in M.L.B., the top league with the best players in the world, let alone also serving as a starting pitcher.\", \"But all along, even after having Tommy John surgery on his throwing elbow, his right, in 2018 and another elbow injury in 2020 forced him to miss nearly two seasons of pitching, he insisted on doing both. In his first season with the Angels, in 2018, Ohtani won the A.L. Rookie of the Year Award. He was even better this year.\", \"\\u201cWhy I love Shohei and why he\\u2019s the best and why I\\u2019m chasing him, the reason is that his mind is the best,\\u201d Kaoru said, growing emotional. \\u201cHe never changed his goal. In Japan, in high school, everybody said a two-player is impossible.\\u201d\", \"She added later, \\u201cHe was No. 1 in Japan but everybody said, \\u2018You can\\u2019t do that in M.L.B., a two player.\\u2019 But he never changed his mind. He believed he can be the No. 1 player.\\u201d\", \"The Iwases, who met in Japan, have been following Ohtani\\u2019s career since he was a highly rated prospect in high school and in much-watched tournaments then. During his five seasons with the Ham Fighters, they traveled from the United States to Japan to see him play \\u2014 and also visit their families while they were there. \\u201cShohei was the first priority,\\u201d Kaoru said.\", \"The Iwases have watched Ohtani grow up, get bigger and stronger, hit some speed bumps, and now dominate on the biggest stage.\", \"Tomoyuki, now a U.S. citizen, moved to this country in 1997, when another Japanese pitching phenom, Hideo Nomo, was starring for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Tomoyuki\\u2019s favorite player used to be Suzuki \\u2014 with whom he shares the same home region, the Aichi Prefecture. (Suzuki, who was also the A.L. Rookie of the Year in 2001, may become the first Asian player elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.)\", \"\\u201cWe are very proud of Shohei and Ichiro,\\u201d Tomoyuki said. \\u201cIchiro, of course, he\\u2019s special. But Shohei, he changed the rules. What he does is just unbelievable.\\u201d\", \"The Iwases, of course, weren\\u2019t the only ones to notice. Even though the Angels went 77-85 this season and extended their playoff drought to seven years, Tomoyuki said he noticed more Japanese people in the stands, too. During trips to Texas to see Ohtani play the Houston Astros and Texas Rangers, for example, he said they met Japanese fans who had come from Florida for the same reason.\", \"Because of their jobs as wedding planners, the Iwases can watch their favorite player all the time. Tomoyuki is a wedding photographer and Kaoru is a hair and makeup artist.\", \"They have their own companies, could work remotely this season and travel all over the country for weddings, lining up a few work trips with Angels road games. They find cheap ballpark tickets, and use cash or airline miles to pay their way. They try to arrive early to watch batting practice.\", \"Asked if Ohtani recognized them after so many years, the Iwases chuckled and told a story. (Tomoyuki does, he said, know the father of Ohtani\\u2019s longtime translator, Ippei Mizuhara.) In 2018, they flew to Seattle for an Angels road trip and brought a happy birthday banner for Ohtani, who turned 24 on July 5, the final game of the three-game series.\", \"Tomoyuki said Ohtani noticed the sign in the stands and perhaps recognized them but \\u201cwe are afraid he\\u2019s thinking about us as stalkers.\\u201d\", \"The Iwases laughed as they said this. To them, Ohtani is inspiring and so is his journey \\u2014 much like theirs, coming to a foreign land for work. The new plaque on Thursday simply formalized what they already knew.\", \"\\u201cHe proves that the level of Japanese baseball is kind of high,\\u201d Tomoyuki said. \\u201cI\\u2019m very happy about that. And also, he proves himself as the No. 1 player, which was one of his goals.\\u201d Kaoru added seconds later, \\u201cI\\u2019m so proud of him.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"bde58cf648ca11ec9b7ce75d74dc5b05"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bde58cf648ca11ec9b7ce75d74dc5b05"}},
