It just boggles your mind when you think about an afternoon outside of a school,\\\" Moore said.\", \"Moore said that there were at least two attackers involved and at least one \\\"very powerful\\\" gun. A 9-year-old girl who wasn't inside the SUV was also wounded Monday afternoon.\", \"Moore believes that a stray bullet from the volley fired by the attackers hit her in the back while she was on the nearby school's playground for an after-school program. Police did not immediately release details on the conditions of the wounded stepmother and girl.\", \"Los Angeles Unified School District officials said that almost 60 children were on the Wilmington campus at the time of the shooting, KCAL 9 reported.
