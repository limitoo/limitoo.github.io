He said that indoor dining would continue as before, with vaccinations required for guests, and that the city\\u2019s plans for a New Year\\u2019s Eve celebration in Times Square would still move forward.\", \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone wear masks indoors in areas with high rates of community transmission. All five boroughs of New York City and all its surrounding suburban counties are in that category. \", \"Separately, Mr. de Blasio said on Monday that he would expand New York City\\u2019s vaccine mandate to encompass all workers in child care settings and in the city\\u2019s early intervention program, which serves children who are lagging developmentally. The mandate will affect 102,000 workers, who will need to have received at least one dose of a vaccine by Dec. 20. Mr. de Blasio said the mandate extension had been in the works before the discovery of the new variant.\", \"Broadly, the mayor and his advisers struck a vigilant but non-alarmist tone as officials worldwide awaited data showing how readily the Omicron variant spreads, whether it causes more severe illness and how well vaccines protect against it. Evidence to support fears over its possible threat has yet to be established.\", \"No Omicron cases have been identified anywhere in the United States, where the Delta variant remains dominant. Genetic sequencing is required to confirm which variant of the virus a patient has; New York City sequences samples from hundreds of cases a week for that purpose.\", \"\\u201cCovid is going to be with us for the rest of our lives,\\u201d said Dr. Mitchell Katz, the chief executive of New York City Health and Hospitals. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not going anywhere, and it\\u2019s all about how we learn to live with this virus. And so far, the data do not suggest that this variant is more harmful in terms of hospitalization or in terms of serious illness.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9b175462514811ec93db91c1c45dc776"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9b175462514811ec93db91c1c45dc776"}},
