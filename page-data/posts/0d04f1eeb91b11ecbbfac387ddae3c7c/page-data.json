In fact, it has only happened once in living memory.\", \"In June 1996, the Justice and Law Reform Committee issued three summons for members of the Road Knights gang as part of an inquiry into gang activity.\", \"Only one gang member was served but never showed up, so the matter was dropped.\", \"The approach from Parliament is in line with the government's condemnation of Russia's actions.\", \"Days before the invasion, the government called in the Russian ambassador to \\\"hear New Zealand's strong opposition\\\" to Russia's escalating actions.\", \"The government has since actively matched sanctions imposed by Western countries, introducing sanctions against Russian oligarchs, officials and their families.\", \"It has also imposed 35 percent tariffs on all Russian imports, contributed $11 million in humanitarian aid and non-lethal military assistance to support Ukraine and shipped surplus defence equipment to Ukraine's military.\", \"Unlike Western countries like the UK and US, New Zealand has not sent weapons to Ukraine.\", \"The Defence Force has offered to send javelin missiles, but Cabinet is yet to take up the offer.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/139611/eight_col_pm6.jpg?1646675746\\\" alt=\\\"- POOL - Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern during the post-Cabinet press conference with Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta, Parliament, Wellington. 07 March, 2022.

The job of a diplomat is to continue dialogue, so that's what we honour until he ... honours the same,\\\" Ghahraman said.\", \"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has defended the decision to allow the ambassador's continued presence, saying the government wants to keep consular and diplomatic channels open.\", \"It is likely Russia would expel New Zealand's ambassador if the government kicked the Russian diplomat out.\", \"As of last week, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, eight New Zealanders in Russia, including individuals and families, have sought consular support or advice in the last month, with the embassy in Moscow also receiving a small number of enquiries and requests for information.\", \"Ardern has not ruled out expelling the ambassador.\", \"\\\"It is an absolute option for us, it just so happens that we prioritised what we consider much more impactful options at this stage.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"0d04f1eeb91b11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0d04f1eeb91b11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
