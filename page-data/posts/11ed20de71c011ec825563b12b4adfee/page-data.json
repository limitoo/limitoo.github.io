We believe it will reduce the demand sufficiently to allow normal usage within the constraints of the restrictions.\\\"\", \"However, Bahrs said if people did not follow the plan and stream levels become critical he would have to introduce tougher restrictions.\", \"Recent rain prior to Christmas might make residents hopeful, however, Bahrs said it would not be helping the supply immediately.\", \"\\\"The streams are fed from groundwater and the aquifers need to recharge.\", \"\\\"Clearly the past three very dry, hot summers have created the issue for us.
