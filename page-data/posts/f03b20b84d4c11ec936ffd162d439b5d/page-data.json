No way,\\u201d a truck driver grunts in Johannes Roberts\\u2019s \\u201cResident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City,\\u201d an inevitable reboot of the long-running, high-grossing franchise based on a video game. And that grouse comes before the trucker catches up to what the bulk of the audience already knows: this crumbling company town, dominated for decades by a pharmaceutical titan called the Umbrella Corporation, has been poisoned by a toxin that will zombify the population in, oh, five minutes or so.\", \"This is familiar lore to fans of the two-dozen-plus first-person shooter games and six previous films. But by leaping back to 1998, Roberts\\u2019s origin tale accomplishes two things: it excuses the absence of longtime star Milla Jovovich (whose director and husband Paul W.S. Anderson continues on as an executive producer) and it embraces oh-so-trendy \\u201990s nostalgia. Out with the future-forward A.I. holograms, in with a kitschy cameo from a beeper.\", \"The characters and dialogue aren\\u2019t worth more than a used Discman. (Yes, that also makes an appearance.) The orphan Claire (a stolid Kaya Scodelario) hopes she and her brother, Chris (Robbie Amell), can survive a night of living dead, mutant Dobermans and one bulbous eyeball tumor-riddled nasty to expose the truth about their hometown. The only surprise is that Roberts shuns cheap jump scare surprises in favor of well-crafted suspense scenes that play out like a game of three card monte. There\\u2019s delight in cinematographer Maxime Alexandre and editor Dev Singh\\u2019s slow-building visual gags, particularly a bit when Avan Jogia\\u2019s slacker cop dozes at his desk while a speeding tanker careens outside the station, explodes in a fireball, and ejects a zombie-turned-tiki-torch who finally disrupts his nap. If the movie\\u2019s weary plot could have been revived with such confidence, \\u201cWelcome to Raccoon City\\u201d would be worth sinking teeth into.\"]","href_hash":"f03b20b84d4c11ec936ffd162d439b5d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f03b20b84d4c11ec936ffd162d439b5d"}},
