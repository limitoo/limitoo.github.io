Liz Cheney (R-WY) shared the anchors' texts describing how the events on January 6 were out of control.\", \"Cheney read out the correspondence ahead of a committee vote which recommended that the Department of Justice charge Meadows with criminal contempt of Congress.\", \"As she outlined the attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters stoked by his false claims of election fraud, Cheney said Meadows had \\\"received numerous text messages which he has produced without any privileged claim, imploring that Mr. Trump take the specific action that we all knew his duty required.\", \"\\\"These text messages leave no doubt that the White House knew exactly what was happening here at the Capitol,\\\" Cheney said. \\\"Members of Congress, the press, and others, wrote to Mark Meadows as the attack was underway.\", \"\\\"One text Mr. Meadows received (said) 'you are under siege at the Capitol.' Another read, 'they have breached the Capitol, while a third said, 'Mark, protesters are literally storming the Capitol breaking windows on doors, rushing in.

Destroying everything you have accomplished,' Brian Kilmeade texted.\\\"\", \"\\\"'Can he make a statement asking people to leave the Capitol?' Sean Hannity urged,\\\" said Cheney.\", \"\\\"As the violence continued, one of the president's sons texted Mr. Meadows saying, 'he's got to condemn this sh*t ASAP.
