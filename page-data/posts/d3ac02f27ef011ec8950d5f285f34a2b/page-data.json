The record numbers that everyone\\u2019s talking about cover only the period since December 2000. That\\u2019s the earliest month included in the Bureau of Labor Statistics\\u2019 Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Waves of resignations may have been considerably higher in previous decades. In fact, as shown in the chart below, which compares the current survey with a similar Bureau of Labor Statistics survey from an earlier era, they probably were.\", \"I\\u2019ll get to the caveats in a minute. But for now, take a look at the huge difference between then and now in the \\u201cquits rate.\\u201d The quits rate is defined today as the number of people who quit during the month divided by the number of employees who worked or were paid during a certain specified pay period that month.The spike in quitting during World War II appears to dwarf the current spike. That makes sense. Back then, many factory workers, especially men, were enlisted in the armed services. Factory owners couldn\\u2019t raise pay to recruit replacements because there was a freeze on wages. Defense industries tried to recruit women with the famous Rosie the Riveter campaign. But the upshot was that workers could quit a job with complete certainty that another would be available \\u2014 kind of like now, times 10.\", \"A high quits rate may look like a victory for the working woman and man, but not necessarily, says Jay Zagorsky, an economist at the Questrom School of Business at Boston University. In an email exchange, he wrote, \\u201cThe problem with very high quits rates is that businesses have to ensure jobs are very easy to learn and take no firm-specific skills.\\u201d He added, \\u201cWhen quits rates soar, businesses de-skill jobs and the end result is the opposite of what workers want.\\u201d\", \"Now the caveats. The earlier Bureau of Labor Statistics survey, which was called the Labor Turnover Survey, was started in 1930 but was stopped in 1981 because of budget cuts. The agency brought back the survey in 2000 and expanded it to include job openings. The agency\\u2019s 2002 description of the new survey focuses on the new job openings calculation rather than the labor turnover calculation. It doesn\\u2019t carry the historical quits data on its website.\", \"The definitions of quitting in the two surveys are different, but minimally, according to a document supplied to me on Wednesday by staff members of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (the document is not on the survey\\u2019s website). In the new survey, the document says, quitting is defined as leaving a job voluntarily. In the older Labor Turnover Survey it was defined as \\u201cterminations of employment initiated by the employee; failure to report after being hired (if previously counted as new hires); unauthorized absences if, on the last business day of the month, the person has been absent more than seven consecutive calendar days.\\u201d That sounds to me like a distinction without a difference.\", \"I got the historical numbers from Historical Statistics of the United States, Millennial Edition Online, which is hosted by Cambridge University Press. The data from 1930 to 1981 is for the manufacturing sector only, so to make the comparison with the period since 2000 as close as possible I used the manufacturing quits rate, not the overall quits rate, in the more recent period. (There were some changes in methodology during the period from 1930 to 1981. For instance, beginning in 1943, quits rates referred to all employees; before then, they referred to production workers only.)\", \"Laura J. Owen, an economist at DePaul University who has worked with the historical data, told me she would be cautious about comparing the data with the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, saying, \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure I could make a definitive statement.\\u201d\", \"Zagorsky was more comfortable making the comparison, saying: \\u201cThe questions are pretty straightforward. You\\u2019re asking employers, how many people quit? Especially when you have administrative records.\\u201d\", \"Even if the numbers aren\\u2019t precisely comparable, it\\u2019s hard for me to imagine that the quits rate now is higher than the rate during World War II. It may not even be as high as it was in the 1970s. Great Resignation? Maybe not so much.\", \"In \\u201cThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\\u201d a poem published in 1798, Samuel Taylor Coleridge described the plight of a sailor dying of thirst while becalmed in the Pacific Ocean: \\u201cWater, water, every where/ Nor any drop to drink.\\u201d\", \"In periods of financial stress, troubled banks are like the ancient mariner, argues a new working paper titled \\u201cLiquidity, Liquidity Everywhere, Not a Drop to Use \\u2014 Why Flooding Banks With Central Bank Reserves May Not Expand Liquidity.\\u201d It\\u2019s by Viral V.

In hard times the Federal Reserve tries to make banks more liquid by supplying them with the most liquid of assets \\u2014 reserves at the central bank.\", \"But very little of the liquidity goes to the banks that need it most, the economists write. The \\u201cperhaps most novel\\u201d reason for that, they say, is that \\u201chealthy banks may hoard liquidity and maintain unimpeachable balance sheets, in order to be perceived as safe and attract more deposit flows, rather than lending it out to stressed banks.\\u201d\", \"The authors say their paper explains bouts of turbulence in the money markets in 2019 and 2020. They conclude that \\u201ccentral bank balance sheet expansion need not eliminate episodes of stress; it may even exacerbate them.
