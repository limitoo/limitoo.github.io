A Pacific-wide tsunami triggered by the blast ripped through the western coastline of Tonga's main island, Tongatapu, causing widespread damage.\", \"Angela Glover, originally from the seaside city of Brighton, had been trying to save her dogs from the rolling waves when she lost her grip on a tree, according to reports.\", \"The 50-year-old's final post to Instagram was a photo of a stunning sunset, captured after an earlier eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai. Glover reassured family and friends that \\\"everything's fine\\\" despite the tsunami warnings, noting \\\"a few swells\\\" and \\\"eerie silences\\\".\", \"According to reports, Glover and her husband had been living in Tonga since 2015 and operated an animal rescue shelter. It's understood the 50-year-old had been desperately trying to rescue her dogs when the tsunami hit, but was washed away by the surging tides when she lost her grip on a tree. James Glover, who survived, managed to cling on.\", \"Speaking to Sky News outside the family home in Hove, East Sussex, Glover's brother, Nick Eleini, confirmed a body had been found in the search for his sister.\", \"\\\"I've not even got the words in my vocabulary to describe how we're feeling at the moment. This is just a terrible shock that it's happened to us. We're ordinary people - stuff like this doesn't happen to people like us, then it does,\\\" he told the outlet.\", \"\\\"There had been a search party that was going on and I believe James found the body.\", \"\\\"I understand this terrible accident came about as they tried to rescue their dogs. Angela and James loved their life in Tonga and adored the Tonga people.\\\"\", \"Eleini described his sister as a \\\"ray of sunshine\\\".\", \"\\\"She loved her life, both when she was working in London and then she achieved her life's dream of living in the South Pacific.\", \"\\\"We are so proud of her achievements in such a short time in Tonga, starting a business and creating a life there. She loved animals and dogs particularly - the uglier the dog, the more she loved it.\", \"\\\"We are just broken.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"33ffddee77c711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"33ffddee77c711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
