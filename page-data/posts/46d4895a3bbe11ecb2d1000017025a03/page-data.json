The book\\u2019s narrator, who receives 8.5 million British pounds in damages after losing his memory in an accident, is a thumb in the eye of psychological coherence. He has no inwardness, only an obsession: the costly and elaborate re-enactment of half-remembered scenes from his past. These re-enactments, which resemble Situationist pranks, don\\u2019t chart a path back to wholeness and authenticity, as the damaged narrator seems to hope (and as the reader weaned on the realist tradition of Austen, Balzac and Henry James might expect). They lead in the opposite direction, to mania, carnage and senseless repetition.\", \"Repetition, senseless or otherwise, has become McCarthy\\u2019s narrative M.O. His next two books, \\u201cMen in Space\\u201d (2007) and \\u201cC\\u201d (2010), were shaggy-dog stories dressed up as grail quests (or possibly the reverse), which seemed to avow that high modernist pastiche \\u2014 the creative refashioning of other texts \\u2014 was what literature was all about, rather than anything as na\\u00efve or straightforward as the careful observation of real life. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like D.J.ing,\\u201d McCarthy, an avid clubber, has said of writing. \\u201cIf Shakespeare finds a good speech in an older version of \\u2018Macbeth\\u2019 or Pliny, he just rips it and mixes it.\\u201d Not all experimentalists are so keen to advertise their debt to the past, but McCarthy, who reveres French theory and the French nouveau roman but also has a lot of time for Dickens and Plato and Cervantes, is unanxiously frank about the roots of his imagination.\", \"In his fourth novel, \\u201cSatin Island\\u201d (2015), narrated by another man without qualities, McCarthy cast a critical eye on the avant-garde principles he\\u2019d largely taken for granted in his earlier work. U. is a fluent and sophisticated \\u201ccorporate anthropologist\\u201d steeped in postmodern thought, but at the deluxe consultancy firm that employs him he spends most of his time \\u201cfeeding vanguard theory, almost always from the left side of the spectrum, back into the corporate machine.\\u201d The Marxist philosopher Alain Badiou\\u2019s notion of the rip (\\u201ca sudden temporal rupture\\u201d), for instance, is applied to torn jeans, \\u201cwhich I presented as the birth-scars of their wearer\\u2019s singularity.\\u201d The book is wry and smart and often very funny, but it also carries an undertow of despair at the failure of radical ideas, or at least at their co-option by a capitalist order they once sought to challenge and resist.\", \"McCarthy\\u2019s remarkable, at times exasperating new novel, \\u201cThe Making of Incarnation,\\u201d deepens and extends these reflections even as his contempt for conventional realism stands firm. Like \\u201cUlysses,\\u201d a text McCarthy treasures, the book combines the very new and the very old. Its protagonist (insofar as it has one) is Mark Phocan, the chief engineer at a motion-capture company called Pantarey, which means \\u201ceverything flows\\u201d in Greek. The name is a nod not just to Heraclitus, who coined the phrase, but to ancient Greek sculpture, one of Western civilization\\u2019s first attempts to capture motion, as it were, and thus, McCarthy gently suggests, a distant antecedent to Pantarey\\u2019s bleeding-edge technology. This technology is used in a vast array of fields (sports, industry, medicine, video games, the military), and Phocan spends much of the book shuttling between Pantarey\\u2019s headquarters in Oxford and those of the company\\u2019s numerous clients. Among them is the high-end film-production studio Degree Zero, which is working on a big-budget sci-fi extravaganza called \\u201cIncarnation.\\u201d\", \"The film, which basically rips the plot of \\u201cTristan und Isolde\\u201d and mixes it with \\u201cStar Wars,\\u201d is about as interesting, artistically speaking, as it sounds, but what captivates McCarthy (as the book\\u2019s title suggests) isn\\u2019t the finished product but the labyrinthine creative process behind it. \\u201cIncarnation\\u201d is to feature, for example, a drug-fueled, zero-gravity sex scene between its two main characters. It\\u2019s Phocan\\u2019s job to figure out just how the scene might be realized. His solution is to rig motion-capture performers to the ceiling of one of Pantarey\\u2019s studios. (\\u201cMost of the actual filming in a film like this is done with stand-in bodies,\\u201d a colleague of Phocan\\u2019s explains.) These performers, covered in reflective markers (the industry term is \\u201cnipples\\u201d), carry out an erotic mime scripted by a computer program, but things don\\u2019t go quite as Phocan had envisaged: \\u201cThe movement, taken as a whole, doesn\\u2019t in any way suggest that all this tumbling and twining\\u2019s really orbiting around a central and impassioned act of coitus.\\u201d When the film\\u2019s computer graphics director sees the rushes, he says they look like \\u201cthe window of a butcher\\u2019s shop during an earthquake.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe Making of Incarnation\\u201d is about far more than just the making of \\u201cIncarnation,\\u201d though. As stuffed with characters and subplots as \\u201cWar and Peace,\\u201d it\\u2019s about the making of nothing less than contemporary reality itself. In this respect, the floating-sex episode, with its unforeseen glitches, is broadly representative. Like \\u201cRemainder\\u201d\\u2019s endless re-enactments, which also never go exactly as planned, the new book\\u2019s endless motion-capture sessions produce a sort of counterfeit, denatured mimesis. But there\\u2019s an important difference, and it\\u2019s indicative of how McCarthy\\u2019s ambitions have expanded over the past two decades.\", \"In \\u201cRemainder,\\u201d the narrator\\u2019s looping simulacra are an essentially private obsession. (When someone suggests he film them, he flies into a rage.) In \\u201cThe Making of Incarnation,\\u201d by contrast, the work of Phocan and his fellow artisan-technicians is so ubiquitous, so much a part of the fabric of society, that most people fail to recognize how mediated and synthetic their everyday reality has become. The megalomaniacal director of \\u201cIncarnation,\\u201d Lukas Dressel, wants the film\\u2019s elaborately rendered spacescapes \\u201cto be iconic; to not only serve as source, reference and gauge-stick for all future sci-fi auteurs, but to loom in the imagination of a whole civilian generation too, haunting their dreams and coloring their experience of a hundred real-world spatial interfaces.\\u201d\", \"McCarthy clearly researched the crap out of his material; on the acknowledgments page he salutes a long list of \\u201ctechnical experts\\u201d and their willingness \\u201cto submit their wind tunnels, water tanks, mo-cap workshops, gait labs and postproduction studios\\u201d to his scrutiny. At times the reader might wish they\\u2019d been a little more withholding. McCarthy, a formidably gifted stylist, can tease an uncanny poetry from his findings, but he can also smother us in superfluous technical jargon. \\u201cA discrete-time Markov chain in countable state space is what we\\u2019re dealing with here,\\u201d one senior Pantarey employee overseeing a pedestrian-motion study at a London supermarket informs a subordinate. \\u201cAlthough I suppose that you could argue for this corridor being viewed as a continuous or general state space.\\u201d This sort of self-enamored pedantry is funny in moderation, but moderation isn\\u2019t something McCarthy has ever practiced. As I read, I found myself wondering how important it was to the book\\u2019s overall effect that we understand the science behind motion capture at the level of detail he throws at us. It often seems that all McCarthy really wants is for us to understand that he understands it.\", \"Given that it\\u2019s scientific detail, the more arcane the better, that seems to most excite him, the real question might be why McCarthy decided to write a novel at all, and not, say, a magazine article. The answer starts to grow clear only around Page 100. It\\u2019s at this point that a secondary character, Monica Dean, a junior associate at a boutique law firm, makes a startling discovery. Dean has been doing archival research on the 20th-century American psychologist and engineer Lillian Gilbreth, whose pioneering time-and-motion studies tracked factory workers\\u2019 repetitive movements by photographing the paths of tiny lights attached to their hands. Those studies, which were used to increase efficiency, might just be of interest, Dean suspects, to one of her firm\\u2019s clients, an anonymous entity seeking legal advice on whether it\\u2019s possible to copyright physical gestures, such as swiping a smartphone.\", \"Digging through Gilbreth\\u2019s archive at Purdue University, Dean stumbles across her late-in-life correspondence with a (fictional) Soviet physicist named Raivis Vanins, who, using Gilbreth\\u2019s light-track method, may have made a breakthrough that could transform our understanding of the physical universe. Gilbreth meticulously preserved the wireframe models she made of her studies in numbered boxes, but the one containing Vanins\\u2019s breakthrough, Box 808, is missing from the archive. Thus begins another grail-quest-turned-shaggy-dog story, which gradually sucks in almost every character in the book.\", \"Phocan and his clique, like Gilbreth in her own day, think of themselves as part of a sort of transdisciplinary avant-garde. One of the motion-capture performers hired by Pantarey, we\\u2019re told, studied German Expressionism in grad school (\\u201cThe stuff you see in the old silent movies \\u2014 how the villains scowl and cackle, and the heroines expand their mouths and eyes into huge gaping circles\\u201d) and believes the work he\\u2019s doing now draws on this radical artistic heritage. When a junior Pantarey employee, skeptical of his self-assessment, asks if he ever acts in dramatic productions, he makes no effort to conceal his disdain. \\u201cNaturalist\\u201d garbage, he calls the contemporary theater, \\u201clike the 20th century never happened, let alone all \\u2026 this.\\u201d He gestures toward Pantarey\\u2019s tricked-out studio, which is, he believes, \\u201cwhere the action\\u2019s at. It\\u2019s the real deal.\\u201d\", \"McCarthy may have a gloomier outlook on the future being engineered by the real-world Pantareys, but he\\u2019s evidently sympathetic to the actor\\u2019s point of view. His own disdain for the naturalist garbage of conventional realism, which goes about its business as though the literary innovations of the 20th century never happened, has driven him to pursue a different kind of fiction, one better suited (in his judgment) to interpreting the source code of modern existence.\", \"But five books deep into a distinguished career, McCarthy\\u2019s work has begun to harden into a conventionality of its own. He\\u2019s repeating himself, in a way that\\u2019s often unproductive. Box 808 is another version of the Great Report, the all-encompassing anthropological study of our age that U. is tasked with writing in \\u201cSatin Island,\\u201d which was itself another version of the ur-message or transcendental signal that the amateur radio buff Serge Carrefax is chasing in \\u201cC.\\u201d Humanly, we learn as little about Phocan & Co. as we do about McCarthy\\u2019s other characters: They are manic ciphers, fixated on their intellectual quarry but devoid of inner life. This may be a part of his design, but in a book that addresses the creeping usurpation of the individual by technology it feels like an imaginative deficit. At this point, the most radical and surprising path forward for McCarthy would be to write a novel in which human beings are treated with the same dazzling complexity as ideas.\"]","href_hash":"46d4895a3bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"46d4895a3bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}},
