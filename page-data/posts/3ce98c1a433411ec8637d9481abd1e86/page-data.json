The medical workforce in rural hospitals is rural GPs and rural hospital medicine specialists, and certainly no ICUs or anaesthetics or surgical services.\\\"\", \"There's also third parties in the mix, such as St John and retrieval services, complicating the transfer of patients between rural hospitals and those in the cities with better facilities and specialist staff.
