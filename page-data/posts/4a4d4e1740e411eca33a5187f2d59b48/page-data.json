Barton had reportedly \\\"had come to her residence and they had gotten into an argument over a sex toy\\\" which Denham had borrowed from him and wanted back. The two were neighbors as well as cousins.\", \"At one point during the conversation, Barton grabbed Denham by the elbow after she demanded that he get off her property. Denham reacted by using a kitchen knife she had been holding to stab him. She reportedly \\\"didn't think she even drew blood,\\\" according to police.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928513/kentucky-stabbing-sex-toy.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Law enforcement officers secure the area where they allegedly arrested terror suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami following a shootout in Linden, New Jersey, on September 19, 2016</div>\", \"Police confirmed that Barton suffered \\\"three minor cuts\\\" as a result of the stabbing. He told officers about the argument and alleged that he was trying to leave when his cousin began \\\"acting crazy.\\\" Denham was sweeping her porch when officers arrived on the scene.\", \"Denham was arrested and held at the Whitley County Detention Center ahead of a December 20 court date. When officers told her she was being taken into custody, she reportedly began to yell that she would not be arrested and \\\"formed a fist with each of her hands, bladed her body in a fighting stance, swelled her chest out, and began approaching\\\" officer, who was able to make her compliant in short order.\", \"She is charged with felony assault, as well as misdemeanor counts of menacing, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.\", \"Denham was previously arrested in 2017 along with two others on drug possession charges. She was a passenger in a vehicle being driven by Gregory Riley when Kentucky State Troopers pulled them over for a seatbelt violation. Due to Riley's inconsistent story, the troopers searched the car and found a crystal-like substance that was determined to be methamphetamine, as well as a pipe used to smoke it.\", \"Denham and the third person, Spencer Toler, told the troopers that the drugs and paraphernalia did not belong to them. Nevertheless, the three were arrested and charged with first-degree first offense possession of a controlled substance, tampering with physical evidence, and drug paraphernalia possession. A further search of the vehicle turned up a bottle of Xanax, and several syringes were also found stuffed in the backseat of the troopers' cruiser in an attempt to hide them.\"]","href_hash":"4a4d4e1740e411eca33a5187f2d59b48"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4a4d4e1740e411eca33a5187f2d59b48"}},
