But the pledge only consolidated the elements of what President Xi Jinping announced in his landmark carbon-neutrality promise last year and immediately following.\", \"This also came after \\u2014 having closed thousands of coal mines and announcing an end to coal financing abroad \\u2014 recent electricity shortages sent China\\u2019s leadership backsliding into boosting coal production.\", \"Reducing its reliance on coal has been a cornerstone of China\\u2019s climate policies. So it\\u2019s unsurprising that critics jumped to question China\\u2019s climate credibility. (News that Mr. Xi would not attend the Glasgow talks in person did not help.)\", \"There\\u2019s no question we are in a climate crisis, and every country should be held to account. However, we must have a more considered approach when judging China\\u2019s actions before crying foul.\", \"The leadership in Beijing almost certainly knows that issuing top-level orders to reopen coal mines on the eve of the most significant climate summit since the 2015 Paris talks, is, to put it lightly, less than ideal. But what might come across as climate contradictions may actually be evidence of China\\u2019s very real and ongoing commitment. They demonstrate the enormous challenges that a country so reliant on fossil fuels to power its economy faces in going green and Beijing\\u2019s blueprint for moving forward.\", \"Energy experts have likened shifting away from a fossil-fuel economy, as China has pledged to do by 2060, to turning a giant ship: It must overcome significant inertia before generating sufficient momentum in the other direction. And China\\u2019s ship is still turning.\", \"Since Beijing began in earnest to tackle its climate emissions just over a decade ago, it has slowly been weaning itself off coal \\u2014 going from more than 70 percent of its total energy consumption in 2009 to around 57 percent in 2020.\", \"This shift has created challenges of its own: unanticipated spikes in energy demand and shortfalls in renewable electricity production, leading to electricity shortages in more than half of China\\u2019s provinces. In response, China\\u2019s top leaders ordered ramped-up coal production \\u2014 but that should not be taken as an indication that they are reneging wholeheartedly on their climate commitments.\", \"The energy crisis has highlighted how competing local priorities \\u2014 like plans for economic development \\u2014 have often taken precedence over climate and energy goals. Beijing\\u2019s recent orders show it wants to fix that. You just have to read them closely.\", \"Coal production increases appear to be an attempt by the leaders to facilitate a safe and just energy transition \\u2014 without leaving their citizens out in the cold this winter \\u2014 that aligns lower-level authorities with a top-level plan.\", \"A thorough reading of China\\u2019s State Council\\u2019s six orders issued on Oct. 8 reveals that beyond the immediate coal production increase, the government cites the crisis as a reason to speed up its transition to a green economy to better weather spikes in energy demand and achieve energy security.\", \"That effectively means accelerating away from coal. The orders urge doubling down on large-scale renewable energy investments and to \\u201ccontain\\u201d the development of projects associated with both high energy consumption and high emissions.\", \"(This response is in sharp contrast to Republican officials in Texas, who blamed renewable energy for the state\\u2019s power outages when extreme winter storms caused widespread electricity blackouts this year.)\", \"The immediate move will certainly increase China\\u2019s carbon pollution and threaten global emission reduction goals. (Coal consumption will rise by 6 percent compared to last year. Even small percentages have enormous consequences for the global climate.) But it\\u2019s clear Beijing is not simply abandoning the path toward carbon neutrality; it is paying a painful short-term price for the fact that so much of its electricity still comes from coal-fired sources.\", \"One could read the recent flurry of directives itself as an indication of China\\u2019s commitment to pulling its weight in the global effort to mitigate climate change. After decades of criticism for opacity in its climate data and statistics \\u2014 from me and others \\u2014 the fact that China\\u2019s leadership is being forthright about its energy shortage and policy response is an important sign of transparency and progress.\", \"This openness comes not through multilateral negotiations but from the conviction that stemming the warming of the planet and the fouling of the air is crucial to Chinese well-being.\", \"I know this because I\\u2019ve studied Beijing\\u2019s environmental and climate policy for nearly two decades, working closely with Chinese counterparts. I was at the 2009 Copenhagen climate talks when many blamed China for the failure to secure a legally binding deal.\", \"Since then, I have witnessed China make significant efforts to rehabilitate its image from Copenhagen wrecker to a responsible player doing its part on climate change. While China\\u2019s motivations are, of course, primarily driven by self-interest, the leadership wants, and deserves, recognition for its climate efforts so far \\u2014 like developing clean energy technologies.\", \"The latest developments, of course, mean that China\\u2019s pledge to peak emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 will be more challenging. But \\u201cchallenging\\u201d is not the same as \\u201cimpossible.\\u201d\", \"Beijing has met or has come close to meeting every major energy and environmental target it has set. (Though Beijing has been criticized for not setting sufficiently ambitious targets.) Data shows China is on a path to exceed its 2030 carbon intensity reduction goals, confirmed by independent, satellite analyses of China\\u2019s air pollution reductions. And China has ratified and adopted its international commitments into law.\", \"That\\u2019s not to say that China has a perfect climate record. And while not unexpected \\u2014 since Beijing historically hasn\\u2019t been one to jump on bandwagons \\u2014 China\\u2019s failure to join more than 40 other countries last week in pledging to phase out domestic coal does not set a great example. (The U.S. and India also abstained.) Nor does it answer the persistent questions about when Beijing will eliminate coal.\", \"In recent days, President Biden was among those expressing disappointment over China\\u2019s lack of commitment to climate change. Saying \\u201cthey walked away,\\u201d he questioned how China could then \\u201cclaim to have any leadership mantle.\\u201d\", \"In my experience, even Chinese climate negotiators hesitate to call their country a climate leader, always saying it is still learning. The recent struggles to decarbonize are evidence of that \\u2014 not of the country\\u2019s waning dedication to mitigating the climate crisis.\", \"It\\u2019s important to give the ship time to turn.\"]","href_hash":"642afd8b3fe811ecaaa10f67130f53eb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"642afd8b3fe811ecaaa10f67130f53eb"}},
