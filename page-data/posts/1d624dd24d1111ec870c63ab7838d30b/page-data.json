There are a few exceptions to this rule, though. I insist on carrying my dented paneer press around with me whenever I move, even though I use it only once every few years, if that often. I would have continued to neglect it if friends in New York hadn\\u2019t trolled me with beautiful, gauzy photos of a paneer tikka dish at Dhamaka, a restaurant I\\u2019ve never even visited.\", \"In those pictures, which were all I had to go on, the paneer appeared in thickly cut slices, smudged with a turmeric marinade full of whole ajwain seeds, parts of it blackened with char, but absolutely white in the center. The photos were accompanied by a fanatical enthusiasm for its intense flavor and impossible tenderness. To me, it looked almost closer to fresh chenna, the big, creamy curds you have before they\\u2019re fully pressed to make paneer \\u2014 still soft and delicate, still full of moisture \\u2014 a tenuous state you can achieve only if you make paneer yourself. Maybe, I thought, it was time to find my paneer press.\", \"When Chintan Pandya opened his first restaurant, he bought his paneer ready-made, from a supplier. \\u2018\\u2018But it just wasn\\u2019t the product I\\u2019d grown up with,\\u2019\\u2019 he says. With manufactured paneer, the whey is drawn out to form a much firmer block, in part so it can be packed and transported more easily, last longer and hold together better when pan-fried and simmered in sauce, as it often is in restaurants. At Dhamaka, Pandya\\u2019s tikka is simply marinated and roasted, so the paneer itself is the star. He realized that if he wanted it the way he remembered it, he would have to make it himself \\u2014 a nuisance, but not because paneer is hard to make. It\\u2019s one of the simplest fresh cheeses for home cooks to tackle because it\\u2019s fast and it doesn\\u2019t require rennet to form the curds, just an easy-to-find acid like lemon juice or vinegar. But a paneer operation does take up precious space in a busy restaurant kitchen, and the yield, as with all cheeses, is extremely low \\u2014 a gallon of milk makes just enough for one order of paneer, which means the restaurant goes through about 25 to 30 gallons of high-fat milk a day.\", \"On top of these minor hassles, Pandya was aware that diners wouldn\\u2019t be keen to pay much for paneer, which lacks the built-in luxury status of European cheeses served in restaurants. \\u2018\\u2018You\\u2019re willing to pay $16 for burrata without blinking an eye,\\u2019\\u2019 says his business partner, Roni Mazumdar, \\u2018\\u2018but will you pay that for paneer?\\u2019\\u2019 I would, if I could only get to the restaurant. Instead, I used a flashlight, on my hands and knees, to rummage under the counter for my paneer press \\u2014 a straight-sided, aluminum sieve that looks exactly like a small, perforated cake tin. I was both annoyed that I had to look so hard for it and thrilled to have such a good excuse to use it.\", \"I washed the press, lined it with a clean dishcloth and brought a gallon of whole milk up to a boil to start the process. After adding the vinegar and turning off the heat, I stirred gently, almost stroking the milk with a wooden spoon, letting it sink down into the pot like a paddle. The curds started to pull apart from the whey, and the liquid turned a pale, cloudy, yellowish green color in seconds. The curds were big and soft, floating dreamily through the pot. As I poured the pot through a colander, they wobbled together as the whey drained and the steam rushed up. After a few minutes, they looked positively cheeselike \\u2014 a soft, milky-scented ball but still not quite firm enough to slice and cook. I put a can of tomatoes on top of the press, just for a few minutes, to help give the paneer a shape, then unwrapped it while it was still soft and fragile.\", \"Paneer this fresh, and still warm, I could eat with a spoon. But I wanted to make the tikka I\\u2019d been hearing about, or at least a version of it. In a small food processor, I blended a thick, yogurty marinade seasoned with garlic, ginger and chiles, lots of carom seeds and some garam masala, and slathered the paneer with it, laying the pieces on slices of red onion. Roasted, then broiled for just a few minutes, the paneer started to char on the edges, and the onions curled and browned. At the table, I dusted it with unripe mango powder and chile, squeezed lime juice on top and tucked the pieces into buttered buns. It wasn\\u2019t exactly Pandya\\u2019s paneer, but it was tender, creamy, hot and tangy \\u2014 a very good reason to move the paneer press to a more prime position in my kitchen, to remind me to use it more often.\", \"Recipe: Paneer Ajwaini Tikka (Marinated Roasted Paneer)\", \"\"]","href_hash":"1d624dd24d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1d624dd24d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}},
