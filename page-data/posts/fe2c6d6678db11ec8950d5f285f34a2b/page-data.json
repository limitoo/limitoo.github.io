It was SpaceX's 103rd successful recovery and its 79th at sea.\", \"The second stage slipped into its planned orbit a few seconds later and all 49 Starlinks were released to fly on their own a few minutes after that.\", \"The launching was the third so far this year for SpaceX, following another Starlink flight January 6 and a \\\"rideshare\\\" mission January 13 that put 105 small satellites in orbit.\", \"Going into Tuesday's flight, SpaceX had launched 1,993 Starlinks, of which 1,741 were thought to be functional. The company has regulatory approval to launch more than 12,000 Starlinks to provide space-based commercial internet access to customers anywhere in the world.\", \"Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News.
