Ruth, a 9-month-old kitten, disappeared from her owner's home on November 13. Her owner, Heather Padilla, then spotted her up in the wires of a tall electricity pole near her home.\", \"Animal Services workers called the power company Imperial Irrigation District (IID) for assistance, according to KNBC-TV. An IID work truck lifted an employee up the pole in a bucket. The worker then scooped the kitten into their arms and brought Ruth back down to safely.\", \"\\\"Thank you to the mayor, IID, the news stations, animal control and all of the community,\\\" Padilla wrote in a Facebook post after the rescue. \\\"Currently, we have her at the animal hospital over by Jefferson (Street). I'm having her checked to make sure she is OK and to get fluids if she needs.''\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937088/adorable-kitten-electricity-pole-reunited-owner.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A kitten that was stuck up an electricity pole was rescued and reunited with its worried owner.

She noticed the tiny newly born kitten had bald patches and looked quite different from her siblings.\", \"A veterinarian reassured the kitten's owner that it was healthy. But when the owner began Googling similar-looking cats, she found that her kitten was a particular type known as a Lykoi.\", \"\\\"A Lykoi is a regular domestic cat that is from a natural genetic mutation among feral cat colonies, which is what her mom's came from,\\\" the cat's owner explained.\", \"The breed's name derives from the Greek word for wolves, according to the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF), a cat registry in the United Kingdom. The name describes the cat's appearance \\\"which is thought by many to resemble a little werewolf,\\\" the GCCF said.\", \"Around the same time, another U.K. cat organization, the Chiltern branch of Cats Protection, posted a story on their Facebook page about a family of cats found living in a bird's nest.\", \"The family was found after a local woman discovered a dead kitten. The woman notified the organization in hopes of finding the kitten's mother and its other litter mates.\", \"The organization spent days searching gardens, interviewing residents, setting up surveillance cameras and distributing leaflets to the local area. But they could only locate the mother cat, not her kittens.\", \"Eventually, the mother cat was seen climbing up a tree trunk on an industrial estate. When the organization investigated, they found that the mother had settled her three other kittens into a bird's abandoned nest.\", \"The organization also found a tomcat that appeared to be bonded with the mother cat, serving as a \\\"dad\\\" to the kittens.\"]","href_hash":"03b6281249c011ec80d91bfee955a5aa"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"03b6281249c011ec80d91bfee955a5aa"}},
