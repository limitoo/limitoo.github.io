The bill would require private businesses to offer and accept vaccine mandate exemption requests. According to WFYI, the proposal would have also banned companies from firing employees who refuse to receive the vaccine.\", \"Holcomb, a Republican, told reporters that he wants to talk more about the issue of vaccination mandates with lawmakers before committing to a decision.\", \"\\\"I want to hear where they're coming from, what their thoughts are,\\\" Holcomb said. \\\"We need to talk about the whole bill in detail, as well.
