But as a linguist, I of course find the word itself serendipitous. \\u201cAH-mih-kron,\\u201d most of us say, or maybe \\u201cOH-mih-kron,\\u201d with many of us at least initially unaware of how it\\u2019s spelled and hearing only the sound of it.\", \"Having spent so much of this year wringing our hands about the Delta variant, and because the word \\u201cdelta\\u201d is relatively common, the advent of Omicron may be the first time many of us have taken time to notice that as we name Covid-19 variants, we\\u2019re running through the Greek alphabet, with some skips \\u2014 there seems to be no shortage of new variants but there was no Nu variant. And even those who know that omicron is a Greek letter may never have unpacked the original meaning, which is \\u201csmall O,\\u201d as in a \\u201cmicro\\u201d O.\", \"Contrast it with omega, the last letter of the Greek alphabet. At one time, at least, the two letters distinguished between the long and short \\u201cO\\u201d sounds. Omega\\u2019s name means \\u201cbig O\\u201d as in \\u201cmega\\u201d O, although the way we pronounce it, we don\\u2019t hear the \\u201cmega\\u201d part as related to the prefix we use in words like megawatt or megabyte. In the same way, when we say \\u201cOmicron,\\u201d the last thing we\\u2019re thinking about is the prefix \\u201cmicro\\u201d we use in microscope or microphone.\", \"Over time, words\\u2019 pronunciations get battered around in millions of mouths and change. Words get shorter, they get longer, they smush up, their sounds change places. Meanwhile, their meanings extend to other things. \\u201cAudition\\u201d used to refer only to hearing. Then it came to refer to hearing someone try out for a play by reciting lines. After a while it referred to assessing applicants for a performance in general \\u2014 now, you can audition to be a mime.\", \"What I love is that these evolutions are normal. Each word is just the current rendition of something always in flux. \\u201cDarn!\\u201d someone says. But English speakers just two centuries ago wouldn\\u2019t have recognized it as a real word. It started with people exclaiming, \\u201cBy the eternal God!\\u201d That, like many frequently used expressions, shortened: to \\u201cBy the eternal!\\u201d Then, just as some people voiced \\u201clearn\\u201d as \\u201clarn,\\u201d many said, \\u201cBy the \\u2018tarnal,\\u201d and then just \\u201ctarnal\\u201d as a stand-alone adjective. Mid-19th-century cartoons and commentary are replete with it.\", \"One said \\u201ctarnal\\u201d in the same situations in which you might also at the time have said \\u201cDamnation!\\u201d Thus, people started exclaiming \\u201cTarnation!\\u201d And since there was also \\u201cdamn,\\u201d it felt natural to figure there was both \\u201ctarnation\\u201d and \\u201ctarn\\u201d or, sounding even more like \\u201cdamn,\\u201d \\u201cdarn,\\u201d emerging from a veritable buffet of changes.\", \"These progressions, particularly the shortenings, can be especially awesome. I\\u2019m reading a novel in which one character, a maid, often says \\u201cyes\\u2019m\\u201d to the woman she works for. The \\u201c\\u2019m\\u201d began as two whole words, \\u201cmea domina,\\u201d which meant \\u201cmy lady\\u201d or \\u201cmy mistress\\u201d in Latin. That shortened to the French \\u201cmadame,\\u201d which was passed on to English and shortened further to \\u201cma\\u2019am,\\u201d and then the mere hiccup \\u201c\\u2019m\\u201d in \\u201cyes\\u2019m.\\u201d\", \"This kind of thing is all over the place in just about anything anyone says anywhere on Earth. It\\u2019s why I\\u2019m not surprised that \\u201cbrother,\\u201d a straightforward term for a sibling that might have stayed the same forever, has now come to mean \\u201cOh, come on!\\u201d Not the bluntly exasperated \\u201cOh, brother!\\u201d which is now rather antique, but something more layered, the laconic \\u201cbruh,\\u201d which expresses the ways in which life can saddle us with a lot. Someone says, \\u201cMy mother wants me to tile her bathroom.\\u201d His friend shakes his head and grumbles, \\u201cBruh \\u2026\\u201d\", \"To me, these things are all examples of the inevitably approximate fit between words and expressions and what they refer to. To wit, it\\u2019s odd when words\\u2019 pronunciations and meanings don\\u2019t change, not when they do.\", \"There are cases where a word holds on to the same meaning forever: As the New York University linguist Gregory Guy told Nautilus, \\u201clox\\u201d has sounded the same way, and referred to salmon, for thousands of years. But even with a word as quotidian as lox (with no disrespect intended to salmon, smoked or otherwise), you can bet that sooner rather than later, the passage of time will mash it with pestles and refract it through prisms to the point that it is all but beyond recognition.\", \"In \\u201cThe Departed,\\u201d Jack Nicholson\\u2019s mobster asks Matt Damon\\u2019s corrupt state trooper, \\u201cWho\\u2019s the lead detective?\\u201d and greets the answer with, \\u201cGood. He\\u2019s a lox,\\u201d with the meaning of, roughly, \\u201cdud.\\u201d On the first season of \\u201cHot in Cleveland,\\u201d Wendie Malick\\u2019s character complains about the Juliet in a school production of \\u201cRomeo and Juliet,\\u201d saying: \\u201cShe\\u2019s a lox. When she dies at the end, no one can tell, because she\\u2019s been so lifeless all along.\\u201d\", \"And so it goes. \\u201cOmicron\\u201d is my favorite example lately, but the new year will surely bring many more.\"]","href_hash":"a8ab7e3d59fe11ecbf1c596c879f26e5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a8ab7e3d59fe11ecbf1c596c879f26e5"}},
