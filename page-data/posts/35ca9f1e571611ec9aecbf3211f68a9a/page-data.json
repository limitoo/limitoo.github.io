The company's website states that it is \\\"Australia's most popular dog walking and doggy daycare service.\\\"\", \"The dogs were signed to an initial Opera House contract after the trial was proven a success.\", \"\\\"We had a trial for a day and found it was great to keep them away while we are there; when we leave, the seagulls come back in force,\\\" said James Webb, the company's owner and principal dog trainer.\", \"The dozen or so dogs have been trained to shoo the pesky birds away from outdoor diners seated along the shore of the Opera House, where multiple eateries are located. During Australia's scorching summer months, the seagulls that inhabit Sydney Harbor have become infamous for dive-bombing plates of food belonging to unsuspecting sightseers.\", \"\\\"The results have been incredibly positive, with the seagulls keeping their distance when the dogs are present,\\\" the Opera House said in a statement.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946429/sydney-opera-house-dog.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Sydney Opera House has renewed a two-year contract for a team of dogs trained to shoo seagulls away from hungry diners at the landmark.
