Russia's foreign ministry reacted furiously on Saturday to a jibe by Blinken that \\\"once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave\\\".\", \"Last month, Russia presented a sweeping set of demands including for a ban on further NATO expansion and an end to the alliance's activity in central and eastern European countries that joined it after 1997.\", \"The United States and NATO have dismissed large parts of the Russian proposals as non-starters.\", \"The United States was not willing to discuss pulling some U.S. troops out of eastern Europe or rule out expanding NATO to include Ukraine, Blinken said.\", \"To abandon its demands for a more-limited agenda would be a major climb-down that Russia seems unlikely to make, especially after weeks of troop movements near Ukraine and a series of tough statements from President Vladimir Putin.\", \"The Kremlin leader has said that after successive waves of NATO expansion it is time for Russia to enforce its \\\"red lines\\\" and ensure the alliance does not admit Ukraine or station weapons systems there that would target Russia.\", \"Ukraine won a NATO promise back in 2008 that it would be allowed to join one day, but diplomats say there is no question of that happening any time soon.\", \"NATO said it is a defensive alliance and Moscow has nothing to fear from it. That is far from Putin's world view, which sees Russia as under threat from hostile Western powers he says have repeatedly broken promises given as the Cold War ended not to expand toward its borders. The United States and its allies dispute such pledges were given.\", \"In two conversations over the past five weeks, U.S. President Joe Biden warned Putin that Russia would face unprecedented economic sanctions in the event of further aggression against Ukraine. The Group of Seven nations and the European Union have joined in threatening \\\"massive consequences.\\\"\", \"Putin said that would be a colossal mistake that would lead to a complete rupture of relations.\", \"Russia's foreign ministry said the team led by Ryabkov had arrived in Geneva. Russia is also due to hold negotiations with NATO in Brussels on Wednesday and at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday.\", \"Reuters / Newshub.\"]","href_hash":"deac63f2717811ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"deac63f2717811ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
