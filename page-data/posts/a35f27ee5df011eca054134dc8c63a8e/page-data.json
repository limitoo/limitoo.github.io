The Tigray forces and OLA were designated as terrorist groups by the government earlier this year.\", \"Ethiopian authorities were able to detain Kiyaro under the newly enacted state of emergency that includes powers of detention. Police have also detained local journalists Thomas Engida and Addisu Muluneh, the state media report said.\", \"Federal police inspector Tesfaye Olani said that the journalists breached the state of emergency law and anti-terrorism legislation.
