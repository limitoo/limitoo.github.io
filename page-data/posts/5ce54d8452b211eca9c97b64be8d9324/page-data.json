People were literally flying on planes with boxes full of tests,\\\" said Satzman.\\u00a0\", \"Not all travelers coming off planes can be persuaded to take the airport tests or the at-home follow-up tests, Satzman acknowledged. Unlike the federal pre-departure testing requirements, tests after arriving in the U.S. are currently voluntary.\\u00a0\", \"And while the program ramped up within days of South African health authorities sounding the alarm over the variant on November 25, Dutch health authorities said they identified Omicron in tests collected there as early as November 19. In Scotland, officials said some cases caused by the variant there had no links to recent international travel.\", \"Spotting America's first Omicron case instead may come from an array of public health and commercial labs which the CDC has funded to scale up around the country, largely sequencing tests sampled from cases in the community.\\u00a0\", \"The system can detect circulating viruses down to 0.01% prevalence, according to the CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. For now, the CDC's latest sequencing report still estimates that virtually all U.S. cases are being caused by the Delta variant.\", \"\\\"We have the tools and surveillance in place to identify the Omicron variant. We also have the tools to prevent Omicron from increasing the strain on our society and our healthcare system,\\\" Walensky said on Tuesday.\", \"CBS News reporter covering public health and the pandemic.\"]","href_hash":"5ce54d8452b211eca9c97b64be8d9324"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5ce54d8452b211eca9c97b64be8d9324"}},
