Snow squalls are considered by the weather agency to be \\\"one of the most dangerous winter weather phenomena.\\\"\", \"The warnings are in effect for portions of eastern Pennsylvania and New York, as well as northern New Jersey. Most of the warnings expire by 2:30 p.m. EST.\", \"Heavy snow is expected to bring whiteout conditions with zero visibility. Wind gusts could top 40 mph in some areas. Travel conditions could range from hazardous to life-threatening, the NWS said.\", \"\\\"Reduce your speed and turn on headlights!\\\" the agency said. \\\"During snow squalls, the visibility may suddenly drop to near zero in whiteout conditions.\\\"\", \"According to the\\u00a0National Weather Service, a snow squall is \\\"an intense short-lived burst of heavy snowfall that leads to a quick reduction in visibilities and is often accompanied by gusty winds.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Unlike a snowstorm, which can last for many hours or even days, snow squalls occur in quick, intense bursts, the National Weather Service said.
