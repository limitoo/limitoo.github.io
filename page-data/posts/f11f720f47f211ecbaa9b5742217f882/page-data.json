It's about '23 and beyond. It's that balance of preparing for short-term results, but also the long-term legacy \\u2026\\u00a0trying to find that right balance.\\\"\", \"Trying is arguably the most\\u00a0revealing word here, because balance is something the Swede has not quite\\u00a0struck almost a year into his tenure.\", \"Despite Australia's historic fourth-placed finish at the Tokyo Olympics, losing the bronze-medal play-off to the USA,\\u00a0the performances of the Matildas throughout the tournament felt more haphazard and fortunate than balanced; relying on brilliant individuals and opposition mistakes more\\u00a0than on holistic, consistent\\u00a0team showings.\", \"Even within more specific positional units, balance has been difficult to come by. The Matildas' leaky defence and lack of centre-back depth have come under regular scrutiny, particularly after conceding 33 goals in 14 games since April.\", \"In Tokyo, Gustavsson's only option to solidify Australia's defence was to rein in full-backs Steph Catley and Ellie Carpenter, which meant sacrificing their natural attacking qualities in the process.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/adb77d845c6fbcaad473c789f7a1c4db\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Ellie\\u00a0Carpenter's more conservative defensive role during the Olympics encapsulated a wider lack of balance in the Matildas throughout the tournament.(Getty: Atsushi Tomura)</div>\", \"There have been subsequent balance issues further up the field, too. Although the Matildas are led by Sam Kerr \\u2013 currently one of the most in-form strikers in the world \\u2013 opposition defences have regularly found ways to shut her down, with Australia sometimes struggling to score convincingly without her.\", \"Then there is the question of generational balance. As demonstrated in Football Australia's Women's Performance Gap report, the difference in playing time, experience, and high-performance standards between the core group of Matildas (those 12\\u00a0players with 50 or more caps) and those emerging behind them is one of the biggest in world football.\", \"Decades' worth of neglect of Australia's youth development pathways, as well as the slow evolution of its top domestic women's league, has led\\u00a0to an ageing senior squad and a dearth of young players ready to succeed them.\", \"Here, then, lies the tension at the heart of\\u00a0Gustavsson's two main tasks: how to deliver short-term results while also building long-term success,\\u00a0when\\u00a0these\\u00a0two goals feel, at times, antithetical to one another.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3bb67d930a3895bd1d050ef507500ae7\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Kyra Cooney-Cross is one of a handful of young players who Tony Gustavsson has seeded into the senior Matildas squad recently.(Photo By Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile via Getty Images)</div>\", \"That is where the concept of balance\\u00a0is most crucial, and why Gustavsson has begun strategically seeding younger players into the core group to try and smooth out that inevitable transition.\", \"Recent months have seen more significant opportunities\\u00a0handed to the likes of Mary Fowler, Kyra Cooney-Cross, Teagan Micah\\u00a0and Clare Wheeler, while others such as Charlotte Grant, Courtney Nevin, Bryleeh Henry, Karly Roestbakken, Remy Siemsen\\u00a0and Angie Beard have been more regularly called into senior camps. Slowly, but surely, the gap is starting to close.\", \"But Australia is not the only nation grappling with the question of how to balance the old with the new. In fact,\\u00a0this is where the upcoming friendlies against the USA will\\u00a0be, in many ways, the most illuminating.\", \"Like Australia, the reigning world champions are currently undergoing their own\\u00a0generational transformation, with many of the big-name stars like Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Tobin Heath\\u00a0and Carli Lloyd ageing or retiring altogether.\", \"The USA's\\u00a0recent performances at the Tokyo Olympics were\\u00a0underwhelming;\\u00a0far from the glory days of their 2015 and 2019 World Cup wins, and a shadow of the dominance that made them the number one-ranked national team in the world for the last several years.\", \"But what the USA has over Australia \\u2013 and what has made them a force on the international stage for almost two generations \\u2013 are their underpinning development structures.\", \"With a world-renowned youth system in the US college pathway, alongside a highly developed youth national team set-up and one of the best professional women's leagues in the world in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), the USA already has in place the structural foundations to ensure their transition to the next generation of national team players is as smooth as possible.\", \"Many of the products of these pathways such as Sophie Smith, Emily Fox, Bella Bixby, Andi Sullivan, and Morgan Weaver\\u00a0have been chosen as part of the USA squad to take on the Matildas in a few weeks' time.\", \"Indeed, an\\u00a0unprecedented number of young and fringe\\u00a0players have been selected by USA coach Vlatko Andonovski for this series, with 12 of the 22 players having 10 caps or fewer. Just six of those travelling to Australia have 50 or more appearances, while only two are over the age of 30.\", \"In addition, all but one of the players \\u2013 Catarina Macario \\u2013 spent\\u00a0their most recent season in the NWSL,\\u00a0and almost every one of them\\u00a0was drafted into the league after emerging from the college pathway.\", \"Gustavsson, himself a former assistant with the USA,\\u00a0noted the parallels, as well as the advantages the USA have in this current transitional moment by virtue of their prior groundwork:\", \"\\\"Even if you're looking at an Andi Sullivan that comes in, or an [Emily] Fox, or a Jane Campbell\\u00a0\\u2013 they've been there,\\u00a0even when I was there. I had them in camps as well.\", \"\\\"If you look at the depth in that team, and you look at a potential starting line-up that they're going to come up with against us [...] you can either focus on the ones not being there and say, 'hey, it's a weak team,' or you can say what kind of line-up can they come up with\\u00a0and you realise, 'you know what? That's a pretty good team.'\\\"\", \"How this new-look, youth-driven\\u00a0USA side performs against the Matildas over the course of these two games will not just be a reflection of the players, coaches, and systems themselves \\u2013 but of the many years' worth of decisions made behind the scenes that led them all to this point.\", \"Any problems faced now by either team are problems that had their foundations laid down long ago.\\u00a0This friendly series will provide fans with a glimpse into how both coaches are trying to address those past problems as they build towards\\u00a0a new\\u00a0future, with more than just a World Cup\\u00a0hanging in the balance.\"]","href_hash":"f11f720f47f211ecbaa9b5742217f882"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f11f720f47f211ecbaa9b5742217f882"}},
