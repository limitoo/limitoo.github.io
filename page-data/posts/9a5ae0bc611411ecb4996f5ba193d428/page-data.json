On this occasion there were staff meetings following a No. 10 press conference.\\\"\", \"\\\"Downing Street is the Prime Minister\\u2019s home as well as his workplace. The Prime Minister\\u2019s wife lives in No. 10 and therefore also legitimately uses the garden.\\\"\", \"The newspaper said the photograph was shared with it after Johnson's office last week denied a social event had taken place, saying Downing Street staff were working in the garden in the afternoon and evening.\", \"On that day then health secretary Matt Hancock had given a press conference urging people to stick to the rules and not take advantage of the good weather over the weekend to socialise in groups, it reported.\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"9a5ae0bc611411ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9a5ae0bc611411ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
