Joshua Camps was a friend. \\u00a0\", \"Maria Cid Medina: These were four young guys.\", \"All four suspects charged with murder, kidnapping, and robbery.\", \"None of them had a criminal history. In fact, Stephen Lindsay and Kaleb Charters were members of the Army Reserve. At the time of the arrest, Lindsay, who goes by Nick, was attending a city college in Los Angeles, along with Kurtis, where they were producing student videos. Kaleb was in Michigan, and Josh Camps was about to get married.\", \"But if Lindsay and Charters were on Santa Cruz County Sheriff's radar back in December, why had it taken another five months to arrest them?\", \"SHERIFF JIM HART [to reporters]: When you look at the evidence that we had on October 1st and October 2nd, we had a murder scene \\u2026 we had a home invasion-kidnapping scene in Pleasure Point, and we had a really grainy video. That was it.\", \"But at a preliminary hearing in October 2021, prosecutors would set out to prove those shadowy figures in the grainy surveillance video were their suspects.\\u00a0 Cameras were not allowed at the proceedings.\", \"The state had to convince a judge they had enough evidence to try Stephen Lindsay, Joshua Camps, and Kaleb and Kurtis Charters for robbing, kidnapping and ultimately murdering Tushar Atre. The Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office laid out their monthslong, meticulous investigation, piece by piece.\", \"Steve Cercone: I think the \\u2026 evidence here \\u2026 is very compelling. And the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office, the investigators did an amazing job.\", \"Tracy Smith: How important was digital evidence in this case?\", \"Steve Cercone: Digital evidence may make this case.\", \"Early on, detectives had identified a blue sedan. It was seen on several surveillance cameras on October 1, 2019, heading to Tushar's home before the abduction and then minutes later heading towards the Summit property. That piece seemed to fall into place when they learned Josh Camps owned a blue Camry. And sure enough, when they showed up to arrest him \\u2026\\u00a0\", \"Steve Cercone: The blue Camry was also there. \", \"Tracy Smith: The car that got them to Santa Cruz.\", \"Believing they had the suspects' ride parked in his driveway, investigators also had a search warrant for the rest of Camps' house -- not knowing just how much clearer the picture was about to become.\", \"Tracy Smith: What did investigators find when they searched Josh Camps' house?\", \"Steve Cercone: Yeah. They found a lot of \\u2014 lotta firearms. They found some flex-cuffs. \\u2026 And they had the same \\u2026 manufacture date that were on the wrists of Mr. Atre.\", \"Tracy Smith: Did any of these guns match the murder weapon? \", \"Steve Cercone: They did not.\\u00a0\", \"Even though Camps didn't have the murder weapon, investigators say he did have ammunition that matched the spent rounds found near Tushar's body. \", \"And prosecutors revealed investigators had also found other forensic evidence. \", \"Mary Fulginiti: What we learned \\u2026 from the preliminary hearing is that there were two prints \\u2014 palm prints of Kurtis Charters' that were found on the BMW.\", \"Tracy Smith: And that's it? \", \"Mary Fulginiti: That's all the forensic \\u2026 evidence that was introduced at the preliminary hearing.\", \"Placing Kurtis in the BMW was a start.

So, the investigators found out that Stephen Lindsay \\u2014 his phone had been shut off from the 27th of September till October 5th. So that's about eight days.

But in a group text from that night, Lindsay's wife suggests she didn't know where he was.\", \"Steve Cercone: She was texting Stephen, her husband, and her two brothers, Kaleb and Kurtis, for hours, wondering where they were. \\u2026 That shows the three of them were likely together because she is reaching out to all of them together.\", \"Investigators hoped cell tower data for Kaleb and Kurtis Charters, as well as Josh Camps, would help connect the dots. They were able to plot their locations on a map, providing the routes each device took. And there it was.\", \"Steve Cercone [pointing to map]: So, this is the surveillance camera showing \\u2026 the Camry going towards Mr. Atre's house at Pleasure Point Drive.\", \"Then, at around 2:48 a.m., their phones ping off a tower covering Tushar's neighborhood at exactly the point those figures were caught on camera emerging from the alley heading towards Tushar's house.\", \"Mary Fulginiti: That was critical. That actually puts these individuals, or at least their phones, in the right location, in the right place to be able to start to corroborate this video that really shows a large chunk of the crime.\", \"At the same time, Kaleb Charters' phone and the blue sedan are seen traveling away from Tushar's house towards the Summit property.\", \"Tracy Smith: So now we're in a different location. This is on the way up to Summit?\", \"Steve Cercone: Yeah \\u2026 now the detectives \\u2026 have placed Kaleb's phone \\u2014 on the way to the Summit right here \\u2026 off of Highway 17\\u2014 in the Santa Cruz mountains.\", \"Followed 17 minutes later by Kurtis Charters' and Joshua Camps' phones and the white BMW carrying the stabbed and gravely injured Tushar.\", \"Tracy Smith: What do we see here?\", \"Steve Cercone: So now you have all three cell phones of the suspects placed in an area \\u2026 around the Summit property. That's pretty clear. At 3:36, 3:35, 3:36 in the morning on the day of \\u2014 the murder.\", \"The cell phone data bolstered the investigation theory that Kaleb Charters had dropped off his codefendants and waited for them at the Summit property.\\u00a0 And that Kurtis Charters and Joshua Camps had participated in the kidnapping at Pleasure Point Drive. But there was no direct evidence placing Lindsay at either crime scene. \", \"Mary Fulginiti: There's no eyewitnesses, there's no fingerprints, there's no DNA, there's no physical evidence linking him to the crime.\", \"But investigators believed that video showed what Stephen Lindsay had done.\", \"Rachael Emerlye: He had a really bright flame \\u2026 I don't know why anybody would want to dull that. \\u00a0\", \"Tushar's flame might still be burning brightly, if not for a chance encounter less than two months before his murder that had led Stephen Lindsay and Kaleb Charters directly to the successful CEO's waterfront doorstep.\", \"Claire Machado: He had the dream beach house, he was a surfer, he was driving a Porsche \\u2026 anybody looking at that lifestyle who didn't have it could be easily jealous of it.\", \"Tushar had hired Lindsay and Charters after one of them had made a telemarketing call to one of Tushar's associates.\", \"Steve Cercone: It was very random. \\u2026 And they came up to Santa Cruz.

And then they all drive away. \", \"About six hours later, Tushar's body would be found 14 miles away at his Summit property, riddled with stab wounds and a fatal wound gunshot wound to the head. \", \"At the time of the arrests, Santa Cruz County Sheriff's investigators announced that Tushar's kidnapping and murder was a robbery gone wrong.\\u00a0\", \"LT.\\u00a0BRIAN CLEVELAND [to reporters]: These people wanted monetary gain and took advantage of the situation.\", \"But the brutality of the case suggests there may be more to the motive.\", \"Steve Cercone: This is a very, very curious case \\u2026 a lot of it doesn't make a lotta sense.\", \"Tracy Smith: If this was a robbery, why chase him, tackle him, and take him away?\", \"Mary Fulginiti: If this is truly just a simple robbery and all you care about is the money in the house and nothing else, once he runs away you let him go. You grab the money then you get out of dodge.\", \"But as investigators would later learn, what set in motion the attack that night was anything but simple.\\u00a0 \", \"Tracy Smith: This is about more than just money.\", \"Mary Fulginiti: It's definitely about more than just money.\", \"The harrowing surveillance video of Tushar Atre fighting for his life gave investigators compelling evidence \\u2013 a record of what happened in the street.\", \"But what happened off camera? The biggest questions: Who shot Tushar?\\u00a0 And why?\", \"The answers may come from Kaleb Charters, Kurtis Charters and Josh Camps. They started talking the day they were arrested. But Stephen Lindsay never said a word. \", \"Tracy Smith: What was Kaleb's role in this?\", \"Steve Cercone: His role, he admitted was to drop them off \\u2026 and he went up to the Summit property.\", \"Kaleb Charters' admission he was the driver matches his cell data and that surveillance video of the blue car heading in the direction of the Summit property. With their ride 14 miles away, Steve Cercone suggests the group had planned to steal a car all along.\", \"Tracy Smith: That they knew \\u2026 they could take that BMW.\", \"Steve Cercone: That they knew that they could take that BMW.\", \"Kaleb Charters' interview provided investigators his version of how the robbery was supposed to play out. \", \"Mary Fulginiti: Kaleb's interview actually talks about the plan. And he has two plans, a Plan A and a Plan B. So, Plan A \\u2026 they didn't expect \\u2026 Tushar to be there.\", \"Plan A involved using the front door code to Tushar's house that Kaleb said he remembered after working for him months earlier and collecting all money and valuables they could find. Plan B, if Tushar was there, involved forcing their way into his bedroom safe \\u2014 the one investigators later found held over $80,000 in cash. Kaleb Charters also revealed how they would open that safe.\", \"Mary Fulginiti: The muscle was Josh Camps. Josh came armed with a weapon. Why? \\u2026 Well, according to Kaleb, Well, to scare him, in case he was there. Just to scare him, so that he could open the safe.\", \"Tushar was home \\u2013 and Kurtis Charters admits he restrained him.\", \"Mary Fulginiti: He admits, and he takes responsibility for, you know, putting the flex-cuffs on him, and gagging him.\", \"But once they took Tushar up to the Summit property, Kaleb and Kurtis Charters made it clear shooting Tushar was never part of the plan. In his interview, Josh Camps initially tried to pin the shooting on the others.\", \"Steve Cercone: It's very apparent that Josh, at the beginning and for quite a while, kept lying to them \\u2026 Josh then decreased his lying \\u2026 and eventually he started to fess up.\", \"He makes what amounts to the most damning admission of them all.\", \"Mary Fulginiti: He ultimately admits to shooting Tushar, and to killing him.\", \"Tracy Smith:\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And he ultimately tells investigators where the weapon is?\", \"Mary Fulginiti: \\u00a0Correct. \", \"But he said there was a reason he pulled the trigger -- an act of mercy.\", \"Mary Fulginiti: He says it was a mercy killing, though. He doesn't say it was an intentional killing. It was one that, you know, they did because they thought he was gonna die. \\u2026because he was bleeding so heavily.\", \"Mary Fulginiti: A mercy killing is not a defense to murder. And, you know, he still pointed the gun at his head, and he killed him.\", \"And at the preliminary hearing, the lawyers for Kaleb Charters, Kurtis Charters and Stephen Lindsay jumped on that statement. They argued that their clients never meant to harm Tushar during the robbery \\u2014 that it all went horribly wrong when Tushar tried to run away, and that Joshua Camps acted alone. But Mary Fulginiti says, even with Camps admitting to being the shooter, the other defendants aren't off the hook.\", \"Mary Fulginiti: They're charged with what they call felony murder, which means if a murder is committed during the commission of a felony, and here we have a couple of them \\u2014 we've got robbery and kidnapping, then under certain circumstances, all of those involved can also be \\u2026 held responsible for the murder. And that's -- that's critical here.\", \"And Kurtis Charters shared with investigators that this might have been more than a robbery from the start.\", \"Mary Fulginiti: What he did say \\u2026 is that he did think that Stephen Lindsay wanted to kill Tushar, and that he thought Stephen Lindsay had a vendetta.\", \"Tracy Smith: When we talk about motive, does this story of Tushar humiliating Stephen Lindsay and Kaleb Charters point to motive?\", \"Mary Fulginiti: Yes. Definitely.\", \"Fulginiti speculates it goes back to Tushar making enemies of the two former military men.\", \"Mary Fulginiti: With regard to Lindsay, he was pretty upset with the way Tushar treated him.\", \"Mary Fulginiti:\\u00a0 When you look at \\u2026 the military \\u2026 respect is a large component of how they lead their lives \\u2026 Tushar humiliated them \\u2026 he made them do push-ups \\u2026 He paid them and then withdrew payment \\u2026 he is feeding into that disrespect \\u2026 and mistreatment.\", \"At the end of the preliminary hearing, the judge decided all four suspects should face trial on all counts. \\\"48 Hours\\\" reached out to their attorneys; they declined to comment. All four suspects have pleaded not guilty.\", \"If convicted they could face a maximum sentence of life in prison. \", \"They didn't get the $80,000 in the safe. Based on their statements, they got a few thousand dollars that they found in the house, a camera and a guitar \\u2026 for allegedly taking a man's life.\", \"Maria Cid Medina: People are looking forward to this trial starting. And they want to see justice served, especially Tushar's friends. \", \"Justice, whatever that might look like, will never be enough to make up for all Tushar Atre had left to give. \", \"Rachael Emerlye: His charisma was infectious. \\u2026 It's insane. It's not meant to be understood.\", \"An entrepreneur and an adventurer with so many mountain trails left to climb, waves still to surf, and melodies yet to strum on his guitar.\", \"Rachael Emerlye is suing Tushar Atre's estate to recoup what she says is her rightful share of the cannabis business.\", \"Produced by Gayane Keshishyan Mendez and Richard Fetzer and Chuck Stevenson.
