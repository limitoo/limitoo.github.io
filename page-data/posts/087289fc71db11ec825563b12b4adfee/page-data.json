this one from 305 balls with 31 boundaries.\", \"Conway's exit saw Ross Taylor arrive at the crease for what could potentially be his last innings in test cricket.\\u00a0\", \"Already New Zealand's leading test run-scorer, Taylor added another 28 to his career tally before he fell, caught by Shoriful Islam off the bowling of Ebadot Hossain.\", \"Henry Nicholls came and went for a duck courtesy of Ebadot, while Daryl Mitchell could only add three runs before he fell to Shoriful for three.\", \"Wicketkeeper Tom Blundell arrived at the crease at No.7, and in desperate need of a score combined with Latham for a 76-run partnership in just 78 balls.\", \"Latham batted on to pass 250, taking the attack to Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque, and raising his bat again after plundering 14 runs from the first four balls of the part-time spinner's over.\", \"Chasing quick runs to set up a declaration though, Latham departed one ball after reaching 250, as his top-edged sweep was caught by Yasir Ali off Mominul.\", \"Latham left the ground to a standing applause from his home crowd at Hagley Oval, departing with 252 runs to his name, with 34 fours and two sixes.\", \"Buoyed by the loss of his captain, Blundell upped his scoring rate to notch a half-century of his own, finishing with an unbeaten 57 from 60 balls as Latham declared at 521/6.\", \"And if Bangladesh's day with the ball hadn't gone to plan, things were only going to get worse with the bat in hand.\", \"With his second ball, Boult landed the first blow, as Shadman Islam edged to Latham at second slip, as Bangladesh's top order collapsed.\", \"At the other end, Southee removed Mohammad Naim for a duck, dragging back onto his stumps, before Boult had a second when Najmul Hossain Shanto also edged to Latham.\", \"Southee removed captain Mominul Haque, bowled for a duck, as Bangladesh reached the tea break at 27/4 - still 494 runs behind in the first innings.\", \"Boult continued the carnage after the tea break, removing Liton Das for eight, caught behind by a diving Blundell - and took the left-armer to 299 test wickets.\", \"Yasir Ali and Nurul Hasan steaded Bangladesh's innings, adding 60 runs together for the sixth wicket, only for Southee to break the stand as it threatened to defy the Blackcaps.\", \"Southee trapped Nurul in front for 41, where the Bangladesh wicketkeeper unsuccessfully challenged the decision as the sixth batter to fall at 87/6.\", \"Boult returned to take his 300th, bowling Mehidy Hasan for five to leave Bangladesh seven down, before Kyle Jamieson made it eight with the wicket of Taskin Ahmed - courtesy of a spectacular catch from Will Young.\", \"Yasir batted on to his 50, raising his bat for the first time as a test cricketer, but fell to Jamieson shortly afterwards.\\u00a0\", \"And with the final ball of the day, Boult knocked over Shoriful Islam for two, raising the ball for his ninth test five-wicket haul, and giving Latham the opportunity to enforce the follow-on overnight.\", \"Victory for the Blackcaps would level the two-match series at 1-1, and give New Zealand their first win of the new World Test Championship cycle, currently winless after three tests.\", \"NZ 521/6 declared (Latham 252, Conway 109; Shoriful 2/79, Ebadot 2/143)\", \"Bangladesh 126 all out (Yasir 55; Boult 5/43, Southee 3/28)\", \"Join Newshub for live updates of day three between the Blackcaps and Bangladesh from 11am Tuesday\"]","href_hash":"087289fc71db11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"087289fc71db11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
