the\\u00a0small Aboriginal community at the heart of the NT's worst COVID outbreak to date, is likely to reach a first-dose vaccination rate of 100 per cent today.\", \"On Thursday morning, Chief Minister Michael Gunner said only 15 eligible residents in the community were yet to get their first dose of the vaccine, but all were planning to roll up their sleeves by the afternoon.\", \"But even prior to the\\u00a0outbreak, Robinson River had a high vaccination rate: with\\u00a077 per cent of residents double dosed\\u00a0and\\u00a087 per cent of people partially protected.\", \"Mungoorbada

said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's a pleasant,\\u00a0lovely little place.\\\"\", \"Robinson River recorded its first case of coronavirus on Monday, after\\u00a0a 30-year-old Aboriginal woman tested positive to the virus.\", \"It was the first case recorded in a\\u00a0remote Aboriginal community\\u00a0in the Northern Territory.\", \"<img

conference brought good news: the NT recorded no new COVID-19 cases overnight.\\u00a0\", \"The Katherine and Robinson River cluster still stands at 19 cases.\", \"But Mr Liddy isn't celebrating yet.\", \"\\\"We need to wait until we get the final results, being such a small community, casual contact is huge so we just need to wait and see,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Take today and then go again tomorrow and see what happens tomorrow.\", \"Robinson River is home to about 350 people, and authorities\\u00a0say everyone has now been tested for COVID-19.\\u00a0\", \"The median age in the community is 23, meaning many people are not eligible to be vaccinated.\", \"Some close contacts will need to be re-tested to ensure the virus hasn't spread and not everyone has their results back yet.\", \"Altogether, 49 people have been transferred from Robinson River to a quarantine centre in Howard Springs.\", \"\\\"I think the community has done a fantastic job,\\\" Mr Liddy said.\",
