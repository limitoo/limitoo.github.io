At the same time, at least one political action committee is using anger at Mr. Rittenhouse to fund-raise for progressive candidates.\", \"\\u201cBoth the prosecution and my son Kyle\\u2019s defense team have finished their closing arguments and I am beyond nervous,\\u201d Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s mother, Wendy Rittenhouse, wrote in a fund-raising appeal that was issued on Tuesday.\", \"\\u201cThis corrupt persecution has been extremely difficult, and I\\u2019m reaching out with an emergency request to help ensure it doesn\\u2019t bury us,\\u201d she said in the email. \\u201cWe\\u2019re already expecting legal costs of about $110,000 for November, but if we can find 2,500 people to donate over the next 48 hours, we should be okay.\\u201d\", \"Another email soliciting donations for the fund was signed by David A. Clarke, a former sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wis., and a former spokesman for a pro-Trump political action committee. \", \"\\u201cWhat was done to that city last summer by a bunch of violent lunatics was an absolute disgrace,\\u201d the email said, referring to demonstrations in Kenosha, Wis., after the police shooting of Jacob Blake. \\u201cKyle was there that night, you better believe it. But instead of starting fires, he had a fire extinguisher trying to put them out. Instead of trying to hurt people, he had a medical kit offering first aid to anyone who needed it.\\u201d\", \"The tone of the emails reflects the way Mr. Rittenhouse has become a hero to many on the right and how the outcome of the trial is being yoked to national politics. \", \"On the other side of the spectrum, the Collective PAC, a progressive group, sent an email on Tuesday using the trial to urge supporters to donate to Attorney General Keith Ellison of Minnesota, a Democrat who is running for re-election.\", \"\\u201cThe truth is that violent white supremacists like Rittenhouse will continue to inflict senseless violence across the country if we don\\u2019t hold them accountable,\\u201d the email said. \\u201cThat starts with electing people who will actually fight for justice.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c360e6da496011ecaad3df092e169c53"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c360e6da496011ecaad3df092e169c53"}},
