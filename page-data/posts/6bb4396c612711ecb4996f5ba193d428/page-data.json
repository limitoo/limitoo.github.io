Just days away from a holiday weekend, Americans are also grappling with whether to change their traveling or gathering plans.\", \"Millions are forging ahead, but, for many, a sense of unease has crept in.\", \"\\u201cMy entire family is pretty uncertain about what to do there, what the rules should be,\\u201d Max Farmer, 24, who lives in San Francisco, said. \\u201cWith Omicron, there\\u2019s just a lot of uncertainty.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Farmer has plans to go to Minnesota this month and see his family for the first time in three years. But he said he was worried about the possibility of getting them sick, particularly a sister who was pregnant.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s definitely something that goes through your head while you\\u2019re traveling,\\u201d he said.\", \"More than 109 million Americans are expected to travel between Dec. 23 and Jan. 2, a 34 percent increase from last year, according to AAA. The number of airline passengers alone is projected to rise 184 percent from last year.\", \"On Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said that it was OK for Americans to travel and gather, but he strongly emphasized that people take precautions.\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re vaccinated and you\\u2019re boosted, and you take care when you go into congregate settings like airports to make sure you continually wear your mask, you should be OK,\\u201d Dr. Fauci said on \\u201cMeet the Press\\u201d on NBC. He urged air travelers to remain masked during flights.\", \"Caiden Nason, a political campaigner in San Francisco, said he would be flying to see family in rural Southern California. \\u201cI\\u2019m a little nervous,\\u201d he said. But he added: \\u201cI just got tested today. My parents will all get tested, too. I will double mask on the airplane.\\u201d\", \"Sally Avery, a native of Columbus, Ohio, who now lives in France, was in Cleveland to visit her daughter. She said the uncertainty over the Covid surge caused her to leave early and miss the holidays with her daughter.
