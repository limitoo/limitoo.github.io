The side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?\\\"\", \"Connor was a commissioner of Birmingham, Alabama, and Davis the head of the pro-slavery Confederate States during the US civil war.\", \"Biden likened the voting rights effort to the struggle against the assault on the US Capitol on 6 January, 2021 by supporters of former President Donald Trump, an attack Biden called an \\\"attempted coup\\\".\", \"His tone echoed remarks last week, on the one year anniversary of the attacks, reflecting a new White House calculus after a year focused on working with Republicans.\", \"\\\"Not a single Republican has displayed the courage to stand up to a defeated president, to protect America's right to vote. Not one, Biden said, referring to Trump and voting rights.\", \"Trump has said the 2020 election was stolen by Biden's Democrats through voter fraud, despite recounts and investigations that found no evidence to back his claim. Since then, Republican lawmakers in 19 states have passed dozens of laws making it harder to vote. Critics say these measures disproportionately affect minorities.\", \"Before Biden spoke, there was a moment of solemnity as he and Vice President Kamala Harris stood before King's gravesite with King's family standing nearby, heads bowed. After the ceremony, Biden and Harris spoke nearby at the combined campus of Clark Atlanta University and Morehouse College, two historically Black schools.\", \"Biden wants to build public support for federal legislation to strengthen voting rights, particularly the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Both have so far withered under united opposition from Republicans, who argue they would impose questionable national standards on local elections.\", \"Biden said if no breakthrough on the legislation can be achieved, lawmakers in the Senate should \\\"change the rules including getting rid of the filibuster for this.\\\"\", \"The filibuster is a parliamentary manoeuvre to require a 60-vote majority in the Senate for passage instead of a simple majority.\", \"\\\"Sadly the United States Senate, designed to be the greatest deliberative body, has been rendered a shell of its former self,\\\" Biden said.\", \"Republicans quickly criticized Biden's filibuster proposal as overreach.\", \"\\\"What the Democrats have coined a 'voting rights' bill is really just a partisan, political power grab. And now they want to eliminate the filibuster in order to advance this terrible legislation, which would only compound confusion in our election process,\\\" Senator Mike Crapo said after Biden's speech.\", \"It was Biden's most direct plea to date for the Senate to change its rules. Whether the votes exist among Democrats to change the rule remains unclear.\", \"Biden said he had been having quiet conversations with lawmakers about the legislation in recent months but that \\\"I'm tired of being quiet.\\\"\", \"Harris, who introduced Biden, warned that without national legislation, newly passed laws in Republican states could impact as many as 55 million Americans.\", \"\\\"If we stand idly by our entire nation will pay the price for generations to come,\\\" said Harris.\", \"Georgia was a battleground state in the 2020 election, and Democrats won two crucial US Senate seats in runoff contests in January 2021 that gave them effective control of the chamber. Later in the year, the Republican-led state legislature approved sweeping voting restrictions. The US Justice Department sued, saying the law infringes the rights of Black voters.\", \"Democrats are girding themselves for tough 2022 congressional elections that could strip them of their majority and the chance to change federal voting laws.\", \"Many civil rights activists say Biden should have done more during his first year in office to push for reforms, and some, including Georgia's Stacey Abrams, did not attend his speech.\", \"Biden told reporters at the White House on Tuesday that he spoke to Abrams and despite a schedule mix-up, they are \\\"on the same page\\\".\", \"\", \"- Reuters\", \"\"]","href_hash":"a777c5c0736711ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a777c5c0736711ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
