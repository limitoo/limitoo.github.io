It ended October with about $29.7 million in the bank, while the DSCC had $15.9 million cash on hand.\", \"But there is some good news for the Democratic Party \\u2014  \\u00a0its candidates have been outraising Republicans in key battleground races. Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia raised $8.9 million in individual contributions in the third quarter. Six other Democratic Senate candidates all topped $2 million in individual contributions in the quarter.\\u00a0\", \"On the GOP side, Senator Marco Rubio ($5.5 million) of Florida and Herschel Walker ($3.7 million), who could face Warnock in Georgia,\\u00a0 were the only Republican Senate candidates to crack $2 million in individual contributions. Some other Republicans have contributed large sums to their own campaigns to shore up their financial standing.\\u00a0\", \"In the battle for the House, Democrats held a slight financial advantage with less than a year to go before Election Day 2022. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised $11.6 million in October, with about $7.5 million from individuals, while the National Republican Committee raked in $9.7 million, including $6.4 million from individuals. Both committees were sitting on about $67 million at the end of October.\\u00a0\", \"Midterm elections are historically difficult for the party controlling the White House.

The Democratic National Committee brought in $11.4 million, with $7.9 million coming from individual donors.\\u00a0\", \"It was the third straight month, and sixth month this year, that the RNC has brought in more money than the DNC.
