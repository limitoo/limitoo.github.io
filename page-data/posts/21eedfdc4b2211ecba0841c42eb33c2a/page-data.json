Their greed, be it for money, sex or power, makes them vulnerable to the most extraordinary fabrications: the more outlandish the promises, the harder they fall for them. Conveniently, their hubris and self-confidence shelter them from the fact that they are gullible idiots.\", \"Such perfect marks are matched with perfect swindlers \\u2014 shrewd, resourceful, prone to fart jokes \\u2014 in the Ben Jonson comedy \\u201cThe Alchemist,\\u201d now being revived by the Red Bull company. Naturally, shenanigans and slapstick ensue, spiced with an abundance of saucy double, and sometimes single entendres.\", \"For the occasion, Red Bull has reunited the team behind its 2017 hit adaptation of Nikolai Gogol\\u2019s \\u201cThe Government Inspector\\u201d: the playwright Jeffrey Hatcher, who translated Jonson\\u2019s dense Jacobean text into a vernacular that is easier on 21st-century New York ears, and the director Jesse Berger, who seems to have never met a door that could not be slammed in a hurry. The pairing is felicitous, though the result is not as consistently funny as their earlier show, especially in the slack second act. Admittedly, very little is.\", \"After his master leaves plague-infested London for his home in the country, \\u201cfor he could well afford to,\\u201d the butler, Face (Manoel Felciano), and his accomplices Subtle (Reg Rogers) and Dol Common (Jennifer S\\u00e1nchez) use the now-empty city house to entertain a series of visitors ripe for the fleecing.\", \"There is, for example, Dapper, who wants a good-luck charm to improve his gambling odds and is made to believe a simple flea, conveniently near-invisible, will do the trick. The expert comic actor Carson Elrod fleshes out Dapper with a veritable arsenal of mimicry and affectations that make his every appearance a delight.\", \"Other targets are more satirically pointed, like the pious Ananias (Stephen DeRosa), who is from \\u201ca Protestant sect banished to Holland for the crime of being perfect,\\u201d or the excellently named Sir Epicure Mammon (Jacob Ming-Trent, in fine form), who covets the philosopher\\u2019s stone that could turn any metal into gold \\u2014 Jonson\\u2019s approach is here very similar to that of Moli\\u00e8re.\", \"Sir Mammon\\u2019s appetites are boundless, and he is bewitched by the suggestion that a single mystery word can trigger the comely Dol into a carnal frenzy. \\u201cHe that makes the stone must be virtuous, he that buys it, not really,\\u201d he says. \\u201cTis the genius of Capitalism.\\u201d\", \"Hatcher dispenses such anachronisms judiciously \\u2014 a joke referring to the James Bond universe is milked for all it\\u2019s worth, especially visually \\u2014 but mostly he avoids the trap of over-relying on them for easy laughs. (The modern model of a classic play being jolted into the present remains David Ives\\u2019s \\u201cThe School for Lies,\\u201d a dizzying rewriting of Moli\\u00e8re\\u2019s \\u201cThe Misanthrope.\\u201d)\", \"The dialogue often zings, and Berger orchestrates the farcical comings and goings on Alexis Distler\\u2019s bi-level set at the requisite madcap pace \\u2014 at the performance I attended, the excellent Rogers (who played the director of the musical-within-the-musical in \\u201cTootsie\\u201d) ad-libbed a line about all the stairs he had to climb.\", \"But the show is better at setting up the plot than at resolving it when we return from intermission \\u2014 it is, after all, easier to throw a bunch of pins up in the air than it is to juggle them.\", \"Luckily, the cast members continue to exert themselves relentlessly in the service of laughter, from mere exaggerated inflections to all-out clowning. If acting is a form of conning, theatergoers, too, are willing victims.\"]","href_hash":"21eedfdc4b2211ecba0841c42eb33c2a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"21eedfdc4b2211ecba0841c42eb33c2a"}},
