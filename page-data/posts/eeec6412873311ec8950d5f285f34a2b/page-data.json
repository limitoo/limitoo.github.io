But that sSkepticism about that idea is gone.\", \"Alina Black, a mother of two in Portland, Ore., sought a therapist who specialized in climate anxiety to address her mounting panics. \\u201cI feel like I have developed a phobia to my way of life,\\u201d she said.Credit\\u2026Mason Trinca for The New York Times\", \"PORTLAND, Ore. \\u2014 It would hit Alina Black in the snack aisle at Trader Joe\\u2019s, a wave of guilt and shame that made her skin crawl.\", \"Something as simple as nuts. They came wrapped in plastic, often in layers of it, that she imagined leaving her house and traveling to a landfill, where it would remain through her lifetime and the lifetime of her children.\", \"She longed, really longed, to make less of a mark on the earth. But she had also had a baby in diapers, and a full-time job, and a 5-year-old who wanted snacks. At the age of 37, these conflicting forces were slowly closing on her, like a set of jaws.\", \"In the early-morning hours, after nursing the baby, she would slip down a rabbit hole, scrolling through news reports of droughts, fires, mass extinction. Then she would stare into the dark.\", \"It was for this reason that, around six months ago, she searched \\u201cclimate anxiety\\u201d and pulled up the name of Thomas J. Doherty, a Portland psychologist who specializes in climate.\", \"A decade ago, Dr. Doherty and a colleague, Susan Clayton, a professor of psychology at the University of Wooster, published a paper proposing a new idea. They argued that climate change would have a powerful psychological impact \\u2014 not just on the people bearing the brunt of it, but on people following it through news and research. At the time, the notion was seen as speculative.\", \"That skepticism is fading. Eco-anxiety, a concept introduced by young activists, has entered a mainstream vocabulary. And professional organizations are hurrying to catch up, exploring approaches to treating anxiety that is both existential and, many would argue, rational.\", \"Though there is little empirical data on effective treatments, the field is expanding swiftly. The Climate Psychology Alliance provides an online directory of climate-aware therapists; the Good Grief Network, a peer support network modeled on 12-step addiction programs, has spawned more than 50 groups; professional certification programs in climate psychology have begun to appear.\", \"As for Dr. Doherty, so many people now come to him for this problem that he has built an entire practice around them: an 18-year-old student who sometimes experiences panic attacks so severe that she can\\u2019t get out of bed; a 69-year-old glacial geologist who is sometimes overwhelmed with sadness when he looks at his grandchildren; a man in his 50s who erupts in frustration over his friends\\u2019 consumption choices, unable to tolerate their chatter about vacations in Tuscany.\", \"The field\\u2019s emergence has met resistance, for various reasons. Therapists have long been trained to keep their own views out of their practices. And many leaders in mental health maintain that anxiety over climate change is no different, clinically, from anxiety caused by other societal threats, like terrorism or school shootings. Some climate activists, meanwhile, are leery of viewing anxiety over climate as dysfunctional thinking \\u2014 to be soothed or, worse, cured.\", \"But Ms. Black was not interested in theoretical arguments; she needed help right away.\", \"She was no Greta Thunberg type, but a busy, sleep-deprived working mom. Two years of wildfires and heat waves in Portland had stirred up something sleeping inside her, a compulsion to prepare for disaster. She found herself up at night, pricing out water purification systems. For her birthday, she asked for a generator.\", \"She understands how privileged she is; she describes her anxiety as a \\u201cluxury problem.\\u201d But still: The plastic toys in the bathtub made her anxious. The disposable diapers made her anxious. She began to ask herself, what is the relationship between the diapers and the wildfires?\", \"\\u201cI feel like I have developed a phobia to my way of life,\\u201d she said.\", \"Last fall, Ms. Black logged on for her first meeting with Dr. Doherty, who sat, on video, in front of a large, glossy photograph of evergreens.\", \"At 56, he is one of the most visible authorities on climate in psychotherapy, and he hosts a podcast, \\u201cClimate Change and Happiness.\\u201d In his clinical practice, he reaches beyond standard treatments for anxiety, like cognitive behavioral therapy, to more obscure ones, like existential therapy, conceived to help people fight off despair, and ecotherapy, which explores the client\\u2019s relationship to the natural world.\", \"He did not take the usual route to psychology; after graduating from Columbia University, he hitchhiked across the country to work on fishing boats in Alaska, then as a whitewater rafting guide \\u2014 \\u201cthe whole Jack London thing\\u201d \\u2014 and as a Greenpeace fund-raiser. Entering graduate school in his 30s, he fell in naturally with the discipline of \\u201cecopsychology.\\u201d\", \"At the time, ecopsychology was, as he put it, a \\u201cwoo-woo area,\\u201d with colleagues delving into shamanic rituals and Jungian deep ecology. Dr. Doherty had a more conventional focus, on the physiological effects of anxiety. But he had picked up on an idea that was, at that time, novel: that people could be affected by environmental decay even if they were not physically caught in a disaster.\", \"Recent research has left little doubt that this is happening. A 10-country survey of 10,000 people aged 16 to 25 published last month in The Lancet found startling rates of pessimism. Forty-five percent of respondents said worry about climate negatively affected their daily life. Three-quarters said they believed \\u201cthe future is frightening,\\u201d and 56 percent said \\u201chumanity is doomed.\\u201d\", \"The blow to young people\\u2019s confidence appears to be more profound than with previous threats, such as nuclear war, Dr. Clayton said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve definitely faced big problems before, but climate change is described as an existential threat,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt undermines people\\u2019s sense of security in a basic way.\\u201d\", \"Caitlin Ecklund, 37, a Portland therapist who finished graduate school in 2016, said that nothing in her training \\u2014 in subjects like buried trauma, family systems, cultural competence and attachment theory \\u2014 had prepared her to help the young women who began coming to her describing hopelessness and grief over climate. She looks back on those first interactions as \\u201cmisses.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cClimate stuff is really scary, so I went more toward soothing or normalizing,\\u201d said Ms. Ecklund, who is part of a group of therapists convened by Dr. Dougherty to discuss approaches to climate. It has meant, she said, \\u201cdeconstructing some of that formal old-school counseling that has implicitly made things people\\u2019s individual problems.\\u201d\", \"Many of Dr. Doherty\\u2019s clients sought him out after finding it difficult to discuss climate with a previous therapist.\", \"Caroline Wiese, 18, described her previous therapist as \\u201ca typical New Yorker who likes to follow politics and would read The New York Times, but also really didn\\u2019t know what a Keeling Curve was,\\u201d referring to the daily record of carbon dioxide concentration.\", \"Ms. Wiese had little interest in \\u201cFreudian B.S.\\u201d She sought out Dr. Doherty for help with a concrete problem: The data she was reading was sending her into \\u201cmultiday panic episodes\\u201d that interfered with her schoolwork.\", \"In their sessions, she has worked to carefully manage what she reads, something she says she needs to sustain herself for a lifetime of work on climate. \\u201cObviously, it would be nice to be happy,\\u201d she said, \\u201cbut my goal is to more to just be able to function.\\u201d\", \"Frank Granshaw, 69, a retired professor of geology, wanted help hanging on to what he calls \\u201crealistic hope.\\u201d\", \"He recalls a morning, years ago, when his granddaughter crawled into his lap and fell asleep, and he found himself overwhelmed with emotion, considering the changes that would occur in her lifetime. These feelings, he said, are simply easier to unpack with a psychologist who is well versed on climate. \\u201cI appreciate the fact that he is dealing with emotions that are tied into physical events,\\u201d he said.\", \"As for Ms. Black, she had never quite accepted her previous therapist\\u2019s vague reassurances. Once she made an appointment Dr. Doherty, she counted the days. She had a wild hope that he would say something that would simply cause the weight to lift.\", \"That didn\\u2019t happen. Much their first session was devoted to her doomscrolling, especially during the nighttime hours. It felt like a baby step.\", \"\\u201cDo I need to read this 10th article about the climate summit?\\u201d she practiced asking herself. \\u201cProbably not.\\u201d\", \"Several sessions came and went before something really happened.\", \"Ms. Black remembers going into an appointment feeling distraught. She had been listening to radio coverage of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change meeting in Glasgow and heard a scientist interviewed. What she perceived in his voice was flat resignation.\", \"That summer, Portland had been trapped under a high-pressure system known as a \\u201cheat dome,\\u201d sending temperatures to 116 degrees. Looking at her own children, terrible images flashed through her head, like a field of fire. She wondered aloud: Were they doomed?\", \"Dr. Doherty listened quietly. Then he told her, choosing his words carefully, that the rate of climate change suggested by the data was not as swift as what she was envisioning.\", \"\\u201cIn the future, even with worst-case scenarios, there will be good days,\\u201d he told her, according to his notes. \\u201cDisasters will happen in certain places. But, around the world, there will be good days. Your children will also have good days.\\u201d\", \"At this, Ms. Black began to cry.\", \"She is a contained person \\u2014 she tends to deflect frightening thoughts with dark humor \\u2014 so this was unusual. She recalled the exchange later as a threshold moment, the point when the knot in her chest began to loosen.\", \"\\u201cI really trust that when I hear information from him, it\\u2019s coming from a deep well of knowledge,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd that gives me a lot of peace.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Doherty recalled the conversation as \\u201ccathartic in a basic way.\\u201d It was not unusual, in his practice; many clients harbor dark fears about the future and have no way to express them. \\u201cIt is a terrible place to be,\\u201d he said.\", \"A big part of his practice is helping people manage guilt over consumption: He takes a critical view of the notion of a climate footprint, a construct he says was created by corporations in order to shift the burden to individuals.\", \"He uses elements of cognitive behavioral therapy, like training clients to manage their news intake and look critically at their assumptions.\", \"He also draws on logotherapy, or existential therapy, a field founded by Viktor E. Frankl, who survived German concentration camps and then wrote \\u201cMan\\u2019s Search for Meaning,\\u201d which described how prisoners in Auschwitz were able to live fulfilling lives.\", \"\\u201cI joke, you know it\\u2019s bad when you\\u2019ve got to bring out the Viktor Frankl,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s true. It is exactly right. It is of that scale. It is that consolation: that ultimately I make meaning, even in a meaningless world.\\u201d\", \"At times, over the last few months, Ms. Black could feel some of the stress easing.\", \"On weekends, she practices walking in the woods with her family without allowing her mind to flicker to the future. Her conversations with Dr. Doherty, she said, had \\u201copened up my aperture to the idea that it\\u2019s not really on us as individuals to solve.\\u201d\", \"Sometimes, though, she\\u2019s not sure that relief is what she wants. Following the news about the climate feels like an obligation, a burden she is meant to carry, at least until she is confident that elected officials are taking action.\", \"Her goal is not to be released from her fears about the warming planet, or paralyzed by them, but something in between: She compares it to someone with a fear of flying, who learns to manage their fear well enough to fly.\", \"\\u201cOn a very personal level,\\u201d she said, \\u201cthe small victory is not thinking about this all the time.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"eeec6412873311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eeec6412873311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
