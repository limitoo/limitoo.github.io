She managed to find an entry-level job with a government contractor that allowed her to work from the safety of her home. There was no fanfare on her first day; she simply opened her laptop and began an endless series of training sessions conducted over Zoom. The sessions were helpful, Kiersten recalls, but very formal, with little room for socializing. Even among her fellow new hires, Kiersten felt at a remove. \\u201cI just stared at their Zoom boxes and willed us to be friends,\\u201d she told us. \\u201cBut we never had the opportunity to interact.\\u201d\", \"With time, she grew accustomed to the daily cadences of her job. But she still felt like a stranger at her own company, whose remote policies were haphazard at best. To chat, employees used an outdated version of Skype; in Zoom meetings, almost all co-workers left their cameras off. Months into her job, she could identify people only by their chat avatars and voices. At one point, she says, she began \\u201cobsessively stalking\\u201d her company\\u2019s Glassdoor reviews, just to try to get a sense of the company culture. She was, by her own admission, unmoored, totally unmentored and insecure, with no way to learn from her colleagues. It\\u2019s one thing to start a new job remotely. It\\u2019s another to start your entire career that way.\", \"\\u201cI was shocked at how all the skills I had learned on how to navigate this type of environment in person evaporated remotely,\\u201d Kiersten said. \\u201cThey feel entirely inaccessible to me now.\\u201d She\\u2019s not alone. While reporting \\u201cOut of Office,\\u201d a book we\\u2019re writing on remote work, we heard similar stories from early career workers who\\u2019ve felt adrift during the Covid-19 pandemic. (The participants, concerned about retaliation from their employers, agreed to speak with us about their experiences on the condition that we withhold their last names.) All were grateful to be employed, but many felt left behind, invisible and, in some cases, unsure about how to actually do their jobs. While their companies adapted their work flows to function outside the office, few spent the time to craft policies to mentor young professionals, many of whom found themselves stuck on their couches, attempting to decipher cryptic emails and emojis sent over Slack.\", \"Most newcomers are terrified of screwing up and hesitant to ask questions that might make them sound na\\u00efve. Which, of course, means that they\\u2019re also scared that they\\u2019re already failing. \\u201cI think I\\u2019m missing out on a lot of the soft skills that one picks up in the first few years of working,\\u201d Haziq, a 22-year-old living in Ireland, told us. He\\u2019s found it nearly impossible to socialize with colleagues and lacks the confidence to casually ask a question of his manager or teammates. \\u201cIf I was sitting next to my manager, I could just have a quick chat and move on,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut I\\u2019m much less likely to Slack my manager and ask something because I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re up to at the moment. The amount of on-the-job learning has reduced dramatically.\\u201d\", \"For Kiersten, who had never set foot in her company\\u2019s office, professional life has come to feel like an abstraction \\u2014 to the point that she\\u2019s sometimes not even sure if she\\u2019s employed. (She is.) Worse, her job feels almost completely transactional, with her conversations limited to, in her words, \\u201cexchanging information in pursuit of an immediate, work-related goal.\\u201d\", \"You could chalk up some of these experiences to the harried nature of the pandemic, which required many organizations to build a work-from-home plan, as it were, while also trying to fly it. But many of the perks of truly flexible work \\u2014 a self-directed schedule, distance from overly chatty co-workers, remove from office gossip and politics \\u2014 could also work against younger employees. If companies don\\u2019t create intentional, structured mentorship programs to help younger and remote colleagues with on-the-job learning, they risk leaving a generation behind.\", \"While we believe that the spontaneous water-cooler interactions of the office are often romanticized, we also recognize the ways in which gossip, after-work drinks and even body language come together to teach new employees the standards of behavior in the office. Small talk, passing conversations, even just observing your manager\\u2019s pathways through the office may seem trivial, but in the aggregate they\\u2019re far more valuable than any form of company handbook. But that doesn\\u2019t mean they can\\u2019t be translated into a remote or flexible work environment.\", \"Almost every story we heard from adrift and isolated employees had the same root cause: well-intentioned but frazzled managers working inside systems that adapted to the pandemic by trying to cram office work into the home. \\u201cWhen I joined, my manager was like, \\u2018Oh, if we were in the office, I would\\u2019ve taken you out to lunch and gotten to know you,\\u2019\\u201d Kiersten said. \\u201cShe realized that things were missing but didn\\u2019t have any strategies to replicate that type of experience.\\u201d But Kiersten didn\\u2019t blame her manager for not doing more; it was clear she didn\\u2019t have any support or practice in remotely onboarding employees.\", \"For Joe, a midcareer lawyer who started a government fellowship right before the beginning of the pandemic, remote work meant that his already distant manager disappeared fully. Pre-pandemic, he described his supervisor as \\u201cone of those people that was visibly very busy and constantly apologizing for it.\\u201d Things only got worse when they left the office. \\u201cI can\\u2019t emphasize the extent to which I felt like I fell off the face of the earth to her,\\u201d he said. Like Kiersten, Joe doesn\\u2019t blame his supervisor or have any ill will toward her, as he says she clearly struggled during the early parts of the pandemic with childcare issues. But because Joe\\u2019s office made no formal plans to adapt schedules or work flows for remote work when the pandemic started, his supervisor\\u2019s struggles trickled down to him.\", \"The first week of remote work, Joe\\u2019s supervisor canceled their check-in without rescheduling a new one. \\u201cWe went months without emailing over the rest of the fellowship, and we only spoke on the phone once over that time, and weren\\u2019t in any meetings together,\\u201d he said. On his last day, there was no exit interview or procedure at all. \\u201cI sent out a goodbye email to about two dozen people right before leaving my laptop in the office on my last day and cc\\u2019d my personal email, but only one person wrote back,\\u201d he recalled.\", \"This is a classic example of how flexible work \\u2014 absent intentionally designed support systems \\u2014 can hurt the most inexperienced employees in an organization. Had Joe\\u2019s office implemented a remote plan, it\\u2019s possible his supervisor could have changed her schedule to fit her needs or delegated portions of her work across other employees and departments. If she\\u2019d felt more supported, perhaps she might not have felt the need to juggle direct reports she didn\\u2019t have time to mentor. Perhaps the organization could have crafted clear HR policies and procedures so that employees lacking guidance could feel comfortable coming forward. Something, anything, would have been better than nothing.\", \"We asked early career workers what resources they wished they could have had during those early pandemic months, and the responses were full of helpful ideas for any company. Most important, they wanted a clearly delineated mentor who \\u2014 crucially \\u2014 was not also their supervisor or in charge of evaluating their performance. One person suggested a dual mentor program that paired new employees with a co-worker in a similar position in the company who could offer advice on more quotidian concerns, as well as a more senior employee who could provide longer-term career advice.\", \"Others wanted more scheduled sessions for employees to come together and bond. \\u201cZoom meetings are not enough,\\u201d Joe told us, though he struggled to articulate exactly what kind of bonding might work. \\u201cMaybe take something that people already do and bring it into the workplace \\u2014 pub quizzes, pen pals, video games, a book or movie club. I feel stupid writing those! But you have to try something.\\u201d\", \"Kiersten, for her part, eventually found camaraderie in her company\\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. \\u201cWe just spent most of the first session doing introductions and talking about quarantine work-life balance,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut it was still really nice to have a dedicated time and space to meet people not from my project team and learn about them personally and not just via their deliverable output.\\u201d Importantly, these sessions were presented as safe, off-the-record opportunities to connect but also to vent and commiserate, which is often the primary (if unacknowledged) value of in-person co-worker interactions.\", \"But that early professional hunger for structure extended far beyond Zoom meetups. People wanted opportunities to sit in on calls with senior members of different teams \\u2014 the equivalent of silently sitting in on an in-person meeting \\u2014 if only to get a better sense of what others\\u2019 jobs entailed. They wanted access to email templates for specific kinds of intra-office and out-of-office outreach. They wanted to know what time was normal to reply to emails. In short, they wanted to be told what they were supposed to be doing at work and how to do it successfully. Even those who admitted that such guidance could quickly become stifling agreed that it was better than flailing around with vague expectations and zero guidance.\", \"Speaking to those who feel left behind by remote work, we realized there\\u2019s no one template for creating mentorship opportunities and support. For organizations with a hybrid approach, where employees split time between home and the office, some of these problems may quickly abate. A few days in the office won\\u2019t fix these larger issues. But intentional design could. Truly flexible work may seem breezy and carefree, but it\\u2019s actually the product of careful planning and clear communication. It requires peering around corners and attempting to identify needs and problems before they fester. It may seem onerous at first, especially when \\u201cLet\\u2019s just go back to the way things were before\\u201d seems like such a clear option.\", \"But it\\u2019s not. We\\u2019ve moved past that point. If we\\u2019re serious about building a sustainable future of work, we can\\u2019t leave a whole swath of employees behind. They\\u2019ll just develop bad habits and waste endless hours trying to piece together the rules of the game when someone could\\u2019ve just told them. You have to decide: Are you going to pretend the problem doesn\\u2019t exist, allowing it to tax your organization in all sorts of tangible and intangible ways, or are you going to invest in the sort of intentional mentorship and structure that will yield dividends down the road?\"]","href_hash":"fc53b09e4b7e11ecaa1c65446754d144"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fc53b09e4b7e11ecaa1c65446754d144"}},
