The company's CEO, Brian Chesky, announced late Thursday night that Airbnb is suspending \\\"all operations in Russia,\\\" as well as the country's close ally Belarus.\\u00a0\", \"Airbnb is suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus\", \"The announcement came as Russian forces attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Energodar, sparking a fire. The fire and shelling at the site prompted fears of a Chernobyl-like emergency, as Ukrainian officials said that Russian troops were preventing firefighters from extinguishing the flames. After a few hours, Russian forces seized the plant and the fire was extinguished.\\u00a0\", \"Earlier this week, Airbnb announced that its organization, Airbnb.org, is planning to help shelter up to 100,000 people who have fled Ukraine because of the invasion.
