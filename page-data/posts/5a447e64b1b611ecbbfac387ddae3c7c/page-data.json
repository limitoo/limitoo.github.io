Some could save hundreds of dollars annually, and all insured patients would get the benefit of predictable monthly costs for insulin. The bill would not help the uninsured.\", \"But the Affordable Insulin Now Act will serve as a political vehicle to rally Democrats and force Republicans who oppose it into uncomfortable votes ahead of the midterms. For the legislation to pass Congress, 10 Republican senators would have to vote in favor. Democrats acknowledge they don't have an answer for how that's going to happen.\", \"\\\"If 10 Republicans stand between the American people being able to get access to affordable insulin, that's a good question for 10 Republicans to answer,\\\" said Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee, a cosponsor of the House bill. \\\"Republicans get diabetes, too. Republicans die from diabetes.\\\"\", \"Public opinion polls have consistently shown support across party lines for congressional action to limit drug costs.\", \"But Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican from Washington, complained the legislation is only \\\"a small piece of a larger package around government price controls for prescription drugs.\\\" Critics say the bill would raise premiums and fails to target pharmaceutical middlemen seen as contributing to high list prices for insulin.\", \"Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said Democrats could have a deal on prescription drugs if they drop their bid to authorize Medicare to negotiate prices. \\\"Do Democrats really want to help seniors, or would they rather have the campaign issue?\\\" Grassley said.\", \"The insulin bill, which would take effect in 2023, represents just one provision of a much broader prescription drug package in President Joe Biden's social and climate legislation.\", \"In addition to a similar $35 cap on insulin, the Biden bill would authorize Medicare to negotiate prices for a range of drugs, including insulin. It would penalize drugmakers who raise prices faster than inflation and overhaul the Medicare prescription drug benefit to limit out-of-pocket costs for enrollees.\", \"Mr. Biden's agenda passed the House only to stall in the Senate because Democrats could not reach consensus. Party leaders haven't abandoned hope of getting the legislation moving again, and preserving its drug pricing curbs largely intact.\"]","href_hash":"5a447e64b1b611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5a447e64b1b611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
