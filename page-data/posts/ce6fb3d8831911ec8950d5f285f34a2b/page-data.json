One is that people need to feel that we care about them deeply - and we do care deeply about people - and secondly we need to use our centre-right politics and principles and beliefs and apply that thinking to some of the biggest problems and challenges that we have in this country.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cSo that's my challenge.
