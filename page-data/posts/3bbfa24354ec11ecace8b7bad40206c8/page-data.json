For Giovanna Gonzalez, it was those three little letters, R.T.O., coming from her investment management boss. For Tiffany Knighten, it was finding out that a teammate\\u2019s annual salary was over $10,000 higher than hers for a role at her level.\", \"They were fed up. They were ready to resign. And they wanted their TikTok followers to know.\", \"\\u201cMy mental health welcoming me back after leaving c*rporate america,\\u201d read the caption on Ms. Knighten\\u2019s video posted in September, which featured her wearing a hat that said \\u201cI hate it here\\u201d and dancing to Ariana Grande\\u2019s \\u201cThank U, Next.\\u201d\", \"America\\u2019s quitting rate \\u2014 the percentage of workers voluntarily leaving their jobs \\u2014 is historically high, reaching 3 percent this fall. It is also exceptionally visible. People are celebrating their resignations in Instagram reels or \\u201cQuitToks.\\u201d They\\u2019re turning to the Reddit forum R/antiwork, where subscriptions ballooned this year, to gloat about being free from their 9-to-5 jobs. They\\u2019re tweeting screenshots of texts to their bosses declaring they have quit.\", \"\\u201cPeople have told me, \\u2018Sis, I quit my job. Let\\u2019s go get drinks,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Knighten, a 28-year-old Black woman, said. She said she faced persistent microaggressions in her previous workplace and left to run her own communications agency called Brand Curators. \\u201cEveryone is loud and proud to say they let go of what wasn\\u2019t serving them.\\u201d\", \"Even chief executives are joining in on the public displays of resignation. The head of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, this week shared on his own platform that he was stepping down. \\u201cNot sure anyone has heard but, I resigned from Twitter,\\u201d Mr. Dorsey wrote, posting a screenshot of an email that concluded, \\u201cPS I\\u2019m tweeting this email. My one wish is for Twitter Inc to be the most transparent company in the world. Hi mom!\\u201d\", \"There once was a time when broadcasting the decision to quit a job might have seemed unwise, or at least uncouth. Career coaches traditionally advised their clients not to disparage former employers online. Though there was always a subset of workers who quit loudly on principle, recruiters often raised their eyebrows at candidates who\\u2019d gone public about negative experiences in their previous roles. But after over a year of laboring through a pandemic, protests over racial justice and all the personal and societal tumult that followed those events, some workers are ready to reject stale professional norms and vent.\", \"\\u201cPeople are frustrated, exhausted, triggered,\\u201d J.T. O\\u2019Donnell, founder of the career coaching platform Work It Daily, said. \\u201cWhen people are triggered, you see fight or flight responses. This is a fight response.\\u201d\", \"If quitters think they can punch back at their old bosses without fear of alienating potential future employers, they might be right. The supply-demand curve of the labor market is working in their favor, and employers are growing less choosy. The share of ZipRecruiter posts that require \\u201cno prior experience\\u201d has jumped to 22.9 percent this year from 12.8 percent in 2020. The share requiring a bachelor\\u2019s degree fell to 8.3 percent from 11.4 percent. Some parts of the United States are seeing significant gaps between job openings and job seekers \\u2014 Nebraska, for example, has 69,000 positions unfilled and 19,300 unemployed people. Experiences that might have once hurt a job seeker\\u2019s prospects, like having taken time off for child care, are being forgiven.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve been doing this for 25 years, and it\\u2019s the tightest labor market I\\u2019ve ever seen,\\u201d Tom Gimbel, head of LaSalle Network, a national staffing firm, said. \\u201cI have clients that are in such need of people that if they weren\\u2019t looking at people who had r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 gaps before, now they are.\\u201d\", \"Some hiring managers have come to feel that making what they previously considered a dicey hire \\u2014 say, someone who blasted a former chief executive online \\u2014 might be safer than letting a staffing shortage persist for too long, resulting in burnout.\", \"\\u201cIn the past, it might have caused people a moment of pause, in terms of what it would mean for their organization, if a working relationship didn\\u2019t end on wonderful terms,\\u201d Melissa Nightingale, co-founder of Raw Signal Group, a management training firm, said. \\u201cNow the big focus for organizations is less on the individual risk of that one post and more on the broader risk of an understaffed work force.\\u201d\", \"Executives are also more sympathetic to the quitters within their own ranks. Bosses used to see departures as a betrayal, like \\u201cbeing dumped in high school,\\u201d according to Anthony Klotz, an organizational psychologist at Texas A&M University. Now, they understand that employees are restless. Mr. Klotz noted an increase in employers who offer a one-year leave of absence to workers who resign, meaning the quitters can choose to return at any point with all their prior benefits in place.\", \"But some people aren\\u2019t concerned about slamming the door behind them on their way out.\", \"Ms. Ianniello, 28, has a lengthy list of quibbles with her old corporate lifestyle. When she worked as a marketing coordinator in Manhattan, she used to wake up at 4:45 a.m. to an iPhone alarm that she labeled \\u201cyou got this babe,\\u201d then blow out her hair before starting a 45-minute commute. Her days were composed of sad desk lunches and \\u201cper my last email\\u201ds.\", \"She quit in February, with about $10,000 in savings, and posted a TikTok over the summer telling her followers that she\\u2019d found a new sense of bliss. \\u201cRight now, quitting is the hot thing to do,\\u201d Ms. Ianniello, who started a podcast called Corporate Quitter, said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s almost like the dot-com bubble, when you made your AIM name and you were an early adopter. You get to be part of the Great Resignation.\\u201d\", \"Some career coaches are cringing at the rush to take resignation stories public. Many warned that hiring managers, even desperate ones, search candidates on social media and consider posts about former employers to be a red flag. Others noted that the current labor shortage, with the work force down by about 3 million people, won\\u2019t be permanent and that at some point, jobs will be in higher demand than workers.\", \"\\u201cThis kind of thing pendulums back and forth,\\u201d Ms. O\\u2019Donnell said, adding that she was alarmed by some of the breaches in etiquette she had seen from people leaving their jobs in the current market, where the standard of giving two weeks\\u2019 notice has shifted: \\u201cYou have some people who ghost. They just don\\u2019t ever go back in. They won\\u2019t take any phone calls.\\u201d\", \"While workers might be tuning out career advice from coaches, they\\u2019re finding guidance elsewhere, especially in online communities. TikTok has hundreds of videos with the hashtag #quitmyjob,including some with advice or moral support for people considering a resignation.\", \"Ms. Gonzalez, 32, who left her investment management role in Phoenix last June, said she was hesitant to publicize the experience because she didn\\u2019t want former colleagues to see the video and feel judged. But she also thought her followers might feel motivated hearing about a first-generation American who saved judiciously, putting aside about $20,000 so she could afford to leave a secure position.\", \"\\u201cI feel like I sound like Kourtney Kardashian, but I need some time off the hamster wheel to focus on myself,\\u201d Ms. Gonzalez told followers on her TikTok account, adding: \\u201cI share this with you guys not to brag, but to show you this is possible.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s decades of motivational posters, but in reverse: Anyone can be a quitter.\"]","href_hash":"3bbfa24354ec11ecace8b7bad40206c8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3bbfa24354ec11ecace8b7bad40206c8"}},
