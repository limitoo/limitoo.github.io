If the Justice Department charges him, he could face up to a year in jail if found guilty.\\u00a0\", \"Meadows's attorney, George Terwilliger, argued in a letter to the committee on Monday that a contempt referral for Meadows \\\"would be contrary to law, manifestly unjust, unwise, and unfair.\\\" He wrote that the contempt of Congress statute was never intended to apply to \\\"good-faith\\\" assertions of executive privilege, and that prosecuting a senior presidential aide would be \\\"unwise\\\" because it could damage the institution of the presidency.\", \"But the committee's contempt report dismisses the privilege argument on the grounds that the sitting president, President Biden, has not exerted privilege over the records in question. They also noted that several of the documents Meadows already turned over would be in violation of the privilege claims if they were legitimate.\\u00a0\", \"Among the documents Meadows gave the committee was a PowerPoint presentation titled \\\"Election Fraud, Foreign Interference & Options for JAN 6,\\\" which was initially intended to be distributed to members of Congress, Thompson noted in a letter to Terwilliger last week.\\u00a0\", \"Meadows also wrote in a January 5 email that the National Guard would be present in Washington the following day \\\"to protect pro Trump people,\\\" according to the contempt report.\", \"The contempt report also described a January 5 email in which Meadows said the National Guard would be present in Washington the following day \\\"to protect pro Trump people.\\\" The committee wrote that Meadows said many more Guardsmen would be on standby, but it did not offer other details about the exchange.\\u00a0\", \"The committee also attached to the report a transcript of the questions they would have asked Meadows had he shown up. The transcript cited text messages between Meadows and a senator in which they discussed then Vice President Mike Pence's \\\"power to reject electors\\\" thereby potentially changing outcome of the election. In one of the texts, Meadows \\\"recounts a direct communication with President Trump who, according to Mr. Meadows in his text messages, quote, 'thinks the legislators have the power, but the VP has power too,' end quote.\\\"\", \"After the select committee advances the contempt charge Monday, Democratic leadership plans to bring it to the floor for consideration by the would House as soon as Tuesday.\\u00a0\", \"The House select committee, created by Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this year, is investigating\\u00a0 the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming President Biden's victory. Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of hundreds more. Trump, who encouraged his supporters to \\\"walk over\\\" to the Capitol during the Stop the Steal rally, was impeached by the House one week later for inciting the riot but was later acquitted by the Senate.\\u00a0\", \"CBS News reporter covering the House.\"]","href_hash":"bb6ea8945c7611ecaf31ffba7c6777e4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bb6ea8945c7611ecaf31ffba7c6777e4"}},
