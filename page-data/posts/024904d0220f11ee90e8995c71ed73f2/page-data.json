I am very happy that I made the final. Elina is such a fighter and a great person. It was a tough match.

I'm just so grateful to be here and to be healthy and play tennis again,\\\" added the 24-year-old, who had fallen so far off the tennis radar that she has been playing at this year's championships without a clothing sponsor.\", \"Svitolina had become a firm crowd favourite at Wimbledon after she produced a fearless brand of tennis to send four Grand Slam champions spinning out of this year's tournament.\", \"But on Thursday, no matter how much the Centre Court crowd tried to lift the Ukrainian wildcard with booming shouts of \\\"We love you Elina\\\", Svitolina appeared to be weighed down with the expectation of giving her war-ravaged country \\\"a little bit of happiness\\\" and froze on the biggest stage in tennis.\", \"A forehand passing shot winner gave Vondrousova the break for a 3-2 lead in the opening set and although she surrendered her own serve in the next game with some sloppy unforced errors, including a double fault, the Czech was back in front again in the very next game.\", \"From them on, Svitolina was left shrieking, screeching and squealing in exasperation over and over again as Vondrousova frustrated the Ukrainian with her swinging left-handed serve to win seven games on the trot.\", \"Just when it seemed that Vondrousova would whitewash her opponent in the second set as the Czech held points to go 5-0 up, Svitolina came out swinging and broke not once but twice.\", \"But that respite was fleeting as Vondrousova blanked out all the deafening cries of support being thrown Svitolina's way to hold tight and sealed her place in the final when the Ukrainian blocked a service return long on match point.\", \"\\\"Right now I'm just really upset that I couldn't go further to play in the final ... I'm not very happy the way that I dealt with the situation,\\\" a tearful Svitolina told reporters.\", \"\\\"I hope I can build on this.
