liken state and territory COVID-19 restrictions to the despotic regimes of Nazi Germany and Cambodia, calling for civil disobedience as a response.\", \"Mr Christensen has been one of the most vocal critics of pandemic controls, prolifically posting on social media to voice his opposition to lockdowns and vaccinations.\", \"\\\"The totalitarian regimes responsible for the most heinous atrocities in the 20th century \\u2014 think Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Pol Pot \\u2014 they didn't get there overnight,\\\" Mr Christensen said.\", \"\\\"They use fear to control, they excluded the dirty people \\u2014 softly at first \\u2014 they justified the exclusion, they moved to harder exclusions, and eventually eliminated people, either socially or physically.\", \"\\\"In 21st century Australia, state premiers are racing down that familiar path, trying to outsmart each other, drunk on power, setting up their own biosecurity, police states completely medical apartheid.\\\"\", \"Mr Christensen \\u2014\\u00a0who represents the North Queensland electorate of Dawson and is retiring at the next election \\u2014\\u00a0cited the situation in his own state as justification for his views.\", \"\\\"With non-vaccinated Australians increasingly demonised, ostracised and socially eradicated in Queensland, the Premier tweeted the people not vaccinated raised red flags \\u2014 not just one but 22 of them,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"The totalitarian path, the path that we are unquestionably on, has never ended well.\", \"\\\"The solution is a rediscovery of human dignity along with, and I don't say this lightly, civil disobedience.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/4e03da9375b64d907efaecc0ea0fac70\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

Opposition\\u00a0Leader Anthony Albanese whether he \\\"unequivocally and without reservation\\\" would condemn Mr Christensen's comments on civil disobedience.\", \"\\\"As the son of a police officer, I believe that everyone should obey the law,\\\" Mr Morrison responded.\", \"\\\"Every single person should obey the law, and no one should encourage anyone to disobey the law.\", \"\\\"And I indeed, Mr Speaker, would condemn any encouragement, any encouragement whatsoever, by any person in any place, Mr Speaker, regarding acts of civil disobedience.\\\"\", \"At no point did the Prime Minister condemn Mr Christensen by name.\\u00a0\", \"However, Mr Morrison followed his condemnation with reference to the union movement.\", \"\\\"'I've been very clear in my denunciation of violence and threats and intimidation, and I don't care, Mr Speaker, whether that has occurred most recently, or it happened at the Shrine of Remembrance, Mr Speaker, or indeed when people and Labor unions tried to crash through the doors of this building many years ago.\\\"\", \"He then cited ACTU Secretary Sally McManus' comments in 2017, saying she did not think there was a problem with breaking laws
