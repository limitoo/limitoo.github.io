Increasing support for low and middle income families to help cover the basics is the fair thing to do,\\\" Ardern said.\", \"\\\"Ending child poverty is a priority for this government. It's estimated a further 6000 children will be lifted out of poverty as a result of these changes. That's in addition to the up to 33,000 children who will be lifted out of poverty by the increase in benefit levels earlier this year.\\\"\", \"The new increases that will take effect on 1 April 2022 are:\", \"Ardern said the payments were aimed at families on the lowest incomes.\", \"\\\"Those with family income less than $40,000 benefit the most with an average increase of $26 per week. But we know all families are doing it tough, so everyone receiving a family tax credit or best start payment will be better off compared to what they receive now.\", \"\\\"The family tax credit was scheduled to have an inflation increase on 1 April next year, but we have topped that up so struggling families get the extra help they need.

This plan includes a full review of the Working for Families system. This review is currently underway and more details will be released next year,\\\" she said.\", \"The changes announced today will also see an increase of the abatement rate for the Family Tax Credit from 25 percent to 27 percent.
