Equal parts v\\u00e9rit\\u00e9 character study and probing meditation on the virtues of success, the film follows a group of five delightfully earnest overachievers who have internalized, to a stunning degree, the necessity of getting into Stanford and Harvard and other top-tier colleges. Watching these bright, motivated young people apply for and be admitted to (and rejected from) the Ivy League has all the energy of a high-stakes poker game and a reality competition show combined.\", \"The film mostly takes place inside the school, yet its inventive and unexpected visuals manage to avoid classroom banality. When the camera zooms in on the science posters on the walls around the student (and aspiring brain surgeon) Alvan Cai, as he gushes about Lowell\\u2019s beloved physics teacher Mr. Shapiro, the close-up transforms these dog-eared microscopic images of biology into sharp abstract paintings. Lum and the cinematographers Lou Nakasako and Kathy Huang skillfully harness the depth of field of their images to routinely point us toward a wider view that the Lowell students often lack.\", \"As Lowell has a majority Asian American student population, the film briefly takes up the complex well of anti-affirmative action sentiment among some Asian Americans, but its attempts to use Lowell teachers as talking heads on this topic feel stunted and confusing. (Here Peter Nick\\u2019s film \\u201cHomeroom\\u201d pairs nicely as another Bay Area-set doc that examines youth politics to greater satisfaction.)\", \"However, Lum smartly interrogates the \\u201ctiger mom\\u201d archetype by presenting more than one kind of Asian mother, and focuses on the experience of a biracial student (Rachael Schmidt) to debunk the myth that Black students only get into Ivies to meet quotas. Quiet yet assertive, \\u201cTry Harder!\\u201d itself succeeds at not trying too hard.\"]","href_hash":"a7ae2ab8539911ec861293606d253166"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a7ae2ab8539911ec861293606d253166"}},
