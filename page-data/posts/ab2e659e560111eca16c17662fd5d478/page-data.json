a\\u00a0welcome sight of wilderness among the maze of shiny, new, modern homes.\", \"Its greenery helps bring the grey and neutral tones of the houses in The Dunes Estate to life, but upon closer inspection, the wetland isn't the tranquil, beautiful feature it may first appear.\", \"Instead, it's a pit of muddied, stagnant water harbouring rapidly-growing weeds and litter.\", \"Pieces of polystyrene float near a path, which looks purpose-built, but is actually a shelf made of layers and layers of silt, so thick you can easily walk on it.\", \"Local resident Jan Selvay has watched on
