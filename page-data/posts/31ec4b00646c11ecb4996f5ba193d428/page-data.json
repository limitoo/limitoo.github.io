Behind them was complete devastation of dead mussel shells and in front was lunch.\\\"\", \"By 2019 the mussel population had declined so rapidly there were just 80,000 left.

One of the reasons the sea stars are so hard to manage is because they can split themselves into two, effectively doubling their population.\", \"And now a Sustainable Seas project is investigating whether that ability to grow lost limbs can be put to good use.\", \"Paul-Burke says the sea stars may have bioactive properties which can heal human wounds or produce highly sought-after marine collagen for cosmetics.\", \"\\\"Any economic value that came from that, could that then come back here to help us to help pay for everyone to better protect our harbour.\\\"\", \"Watch the full story above.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"31ec4b00646c11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"31ec4b00646c11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
