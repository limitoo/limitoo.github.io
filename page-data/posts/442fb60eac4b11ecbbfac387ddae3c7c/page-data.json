After meeting with her, considering her record, and closely monitoring her testimony and questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week, I have determined I intend to vote for her nomination to serve on the Supreme Court.\\\"\", \"It remains unclear yet whether any Republicans will vote for Jackson.
