Hundreds of thousands of young people have joined the movement, wearing Birds Aren\\u2019t Real T-shirts, swarming rallies and spreading the slogan.\", \"It might smack of QAnon, the conspiracy theory that the world is controlled by an elite cabal of child-trafficking Democrats. Except that the creator of Birds Aren\\u2019t Real and the movement\\u2019s followers are in on a joke: They know that birds are, in fact, real and that their theory is made up.\", \"What Birds Aren\\u2019t Real truly is, they say, is a parody social movement with a purpose. In a post-truth world dominated by online conspiracy theories, young people have coalesced around the effort to thumb their nose at, fight and poke fun at misinformation. It\\u2019s Gen Z\\u2019s attempt to upend the rabbit hole with absurdism.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a way to combat troubles in the world that you don\\u2019t really have other ways of combating,\\u201d said Claire Chronis, 22, a Birds Aren\\u2019t Real organizer in Pittsburgh. \\u201cMy favorite way to describe the organization is fighting lunacy with lunacy.\\u201d\", \"At the center of the movement is Peter McIndoe, 23, a floppy-haired college dropout in Memphis who created Birds Aren\\u2019t Real on a whim in 2017. For years, he stayed in character as the conspiracy theory\\u2019s chief believer, commanding acolytes to rage against those who challenged his dogma. But now, Mr. McIndoe said in an interview, he is ready to reveal the parody lest people think birds really are drones.\", \"\\u201cDealing in the world of misinformation for the past few years, we\\u2019ve been really conscious of the line we walk,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe idea is meant to be so preposterous, but we make sure nothing we\\u2019re saying is too realistic. That\\u2019s a consideration with coming out of character.\\u201d\", \"Most Birds Aren\\u2019t Real members, many of whom are part of an on-the-ground activism network called the Bird Brigade, grew up in a world overrun with misinformation. Some have relatives who have fallen victim to conspiracy theories. So for members of Gen Z, the movement has become a way to collectively grapple with those experiences. By cosplaying conspiracy theorists, they have found community and kinship, Mr. McIndoe said.\", \"\\u201cBirds Aren\\u2019t Real is not a shallow satire of conspiracies from the outside. It is from the deep inside,\\u201d he said. \\u201cA lot of people in our generation feel the lunacy in all this, and Birds Aren\\u2019t Real has been a way for people to process that.\\u201d\", \"Cameron Kasky, 21, an activist from Parkland, Fla., who helped organize the March for Our Lives student protest against gun violence in 2018 and is involved in Birds Aren\\u2019t Real, said the parody \\u201cmakes you stop for a second and laugh. In a uniquely bleak time to come of age, it doesn\\u2019t hurt to have something to laugh about together.\\u201d\", \"Mr. McIndoe, too, marinated in conspiracies. For his first 18 years, he grew up in a deeply conservative and religious community with seven siblings outside Cincinnati, then in rural Arkansas. He was home-schooled, taught that \\u201cevolution was a massive brainwashing plan by the Democrats and Obama was the Antichrist,\\u201d he said.\", \"He read books like \\u201cRemote Control,\\u201d about what it said were hidden anti-Christianity messages from Hollywood. In high school, social media offered a gateway to mainstream culture. Mr. McIndoe began watching Philip DeFranco and other popular YouTubers who talked about current events and pop culture, and went on Reddit to find new viewpoints.\", \"\\u201cI was raised by the internet, because that\\u2019s where I ended up finding a lot of my actual real-world education, through documentaries and YouTube,\\u201d Mr. McIndoe said. \\u201cMy whole understanding of the world was formed by the internet.\\u201d\", \"By the time Mr. McIndoe left home for the University of Arkansas in 2016, he said, he realized he wasn\\u2019t the only young person forced to straddle multiple realities.\", \"Then in January 2017, Mr. McIndoe traveled to Memphis to visit friends. Donald J. Trump had just been sworn in as president, and there was a women\\u2019s march downtown. Pro-Trump counterprotesters were also there. When Mr. McIndoe saw them, he said, he ripped a poster off a wall, flipped it over and wrote three random words: \\u201cBirds Aren\\u2019t Real.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt was a spontaneous joke, but it was a reflection of the absurdity everyone was feeling,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. McIndoe then walked around and improvised the Birds Aren\\u2019t Real conspiracy lore. He said he was part of a greater movement that believed that birds had been replaced with surveillance drones and that the cover up began in the 1970s. Unbeknown to him, he was filmed and the video posted on Facebook. It went viral, especially among teenagers in the South.\", \"In Memphis, \\u201cBirds Aren\\u2019t Real\\u201d graffiti soon showed up. Photos of the phrase\\u2019s being scrawled on chalkboards and the walls of local high schools surfaced. People made \\u201cBirds Aren\\u2019t Real\\u201d stickers.\", \"Mr. McIndoe decided to lean into Birds Aren\\u2019t Real. \\u201cI started embodying the character and building out the world this character belonged to,\\u201d he said. He and Connor Gaydos, a friend, wrote a false history of the movement, concocted elaborate theories and produced fake documents and evidence to support his wild claims.\", \"\\u201cIt basically became an experiment in misinformation,\\u201d Mr. McIndoe said. \\u201cWe were able to construct an entirely fictional world that was reported on as fact by local media and questioned by members of the public.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gaydos added, \\u201cIf anyone believes birds aren\\u2019t real, we\\u2019re the last of their concerns, because then there\\u2019s probably no conspiracy they don\\u2019t believe.\\u201d\", \"In 2018, Mr. McIndoe dropped out of college and moved to Memphis. To build Birds Aren\\u2019t Real further, he created a flyer that shot to the top of Reddit. He hired an actor to portray a former C.I.A. agent who confessed to working on bird drone surveillance; the video has more than 20 million views on TikTok. He also hired actors to represent adult bird truthers in videos that spread all over Instagram.\", \"That same year, Mr. McIndoe began selling Birds Aren\\u2019t Real merchandise. The money, totaling several thousand dollars a month, helps Mr. McIndoe and Mr. Gaydos cover their living expenses.\", \"\\u201cAll the money from our merch lineup goes into making sure me and Connor can do this full time,\\u201d Mr. McIndoe said. \\u201cWe also put the money into the billboards, flying out members of the Bird Brigade to rallies. None of the proceeds go to anything harmful.\\u201d\", \"To adults with concerns about Mr. McIndoe\\u2019s tactics, researchers said any harms were most likely minimal.\", \"\\u201cYou have to weigh the potential negative effects with any of this stuff, but in this case it is so extremely small,\\u201d said Joshua Citarella, an independent researcher who studies internet culture and online radicalization in youth. \\u201cAllowing people to engage in collaborative world building is therapeutic because it lets them disarm conspiracism and engage in a safe way.\\u201d\", \"Mr. McIndoe said he kept the concerns top of mind. \\u201cEverything we\\u2019ve done with Birds Aren\\u2019t Real is made to make sure it doesn\\u2019t tip into where it could have a negative end result on the world,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a safe space for people to come together and process the conspiracy takeover of America. It\\u2019s a way to laugh at the madness rather than be overcome by it.\\u201d\", \"The effort has been cathartic for young people including Heitho Shipp, 22, a Pittsburgh resident.\", \"\\u201cMost conspiracy theories are fueled by hate or distrust or one powerful leader, but this is about finding an outlet for our pain,\\u201d she said. She added that the movement was \\u201cmore about media literacy.\\u201d\", \"Birds Aren\\u2019t Real members have also become a political force. Many often join up with counterprotesters and actual conspiracy theorists to de-escalate tensions and delegitimize the people they are marching alongside with irreverent chants.\", \"In September, shortly after a restrictive new abortion law went into effect in Texas, Birds Aren\\u2019t Real members showed up at a protest held by anti-abortion activists at the University of Cincinnati. Supporters of the new law \\u201chad signs with very graphic imagery and were very aggressive in condemning people,\\u201d Mr. McIndoe said. \\u201cIt led to arguments.\\u201d\", \"But the Bird Brigade began chanting, \\u201cBirds aren\\u2019t real.\\u201d Their shouts soon overpowered the anti-abortion activists, who left.\", \"Mr. McIndoe now has big plans for 2022. Breaking character is necessary to help Birds Aren\\u2019t Real leap to the next level and forswear actual conspiracy theorists, he said. He added that he hoped to collaborate with major content creators and independent media like Channel 5 News, which is aimed at helping people make sense of America\\u2019s current state and the internet.\", \"\\u201cI have a lot of excitement for what the future of this could be as an actual force for good,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYes, we have been intentionally spreading misinformation for the past four years, but it\\u2019s with a purpose. It\\u2019s about holding up a mirror to America in the internet age.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"2df7ffde590011ecb66bc5cbcf6af39d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2df7ffde590011ecb66bc5cbcf6af39d"}},
