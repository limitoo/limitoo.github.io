Prerequisites include Taipei's commitment to spend no less than 3 percent of its GDP on defense by 2027, including any extra budgets to that effect.\", \"The country's largest-ever 2022 defense budget of $17 billion is 2.2 percent of its IMF-estimated GDP of $759.1 billion for this year. An $8.6 billion special budget\\u2014expected to pass before the year's end\\u2014would boost its spending to 3.3 percent. Over two-thirds of the funds will go to the mass production of anti-ship rockets and land-based missile systems over the next five years.\", \"But even after Taiwan's budget rises to the expected $25.6 billion, Hawley's $3 billion initiative would still amount to a significant 11.7 percent of the island's total defense expenses for next year.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1925637/josh-hawley-bill-boost-taiwan-defense.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A Chinook belonging to Taiwan's Republic of China Army overflies the Presidential Office during National Day celebrations on October 10, 2021.</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Asymmetric Warfare</div>\", \"An additional requirement of the act is the production and procurement of asymmetric weaponry. China outspends Taiwan on defense by between 15 to 25 times, according to various estimates. Defense planners in Taipei know they cannot match Chinese capabilities like-for-like and must counter specific PLA capabilities with small, highly maneuverable and lethal weapon systems such as man-portable rockets and fast attack boats.\", \"Included in Hawley's legislation is some of the most precise language on Taiwan's defense needs, incentivizing Taipei's development in a way that might prevent otherwise limited funds from being contested by the three main services of Taiwan's armed forces.\", \"The bill proposes specific equipment including ground-based coastal defense cruise missiles and launchers currently being developed by Taiwan, as well as naval mines and minelaying platforms\\u2014also part of Taiwan's existing push for asymmetry against the PLA.\", \"Still missing are Taiwan's missile boats and unmanned aerial capabilities. Taipei is awaiting the delivery of four MQ-9B SeaGuardian UAVs approved for sale by the Trump administration last November.\", \"\\\"Taiwan is in grave danger, but the future is not yet written,\\\" Hawley said in a statement accompanying the bill's instruction. \\\"The Arm Taiwan Act will ensure Taiwan has the asymmetric defenses it needs to deter a Chinese invasion\\u2014so long as Taiwan is prepared to make the difficult choices required to defend itself in the hard years ahead.\\\"\", \"\\\"We should do everything in our power to help Taiwan urgently strengthen its defenses. If China's recent actions have shown the world anything, it's that Beijing will stop at nothing in its quest to dominate the Indo-Pacific and then the world.
