The emails used subject lines, sender names and URLs embedded with phrases like \\u201cteam Beto\\u201d and \\u201cofficial Beto.\\u201d And in most cases, none of the money these emails eventually raised went directly to the campaign.\", \"Mr. O\\u2019Rourke still brought in more than $2 million from 31,000 donors, the largest 24-hour sum that any new candidate has announced this year, his campaign said. But for Mr. Pennington and the rest of the campaign, the nagging question was how much more they might have hauled in if other Democratic groups hadn\\u2019t been so busy siphoning off their share.\", \"\\u201cThe frustrating thing,\\u201d Mr. Pennington said, \\u201cis we will never know how much we lost.\\u201d\", \"Welcome to the sometimes-sketchy world of online campaign fund-raising, where misdirection and misleading everyday Americans \\u2014 often older Americans \\u2014 to maximize clicks and cash is increasingly a dark art form.\", \"Imitating others and mimicking official correspondence with postage-paid mailers is an age-old trick that marketers have used since long before the internet. The tactic has been adapted and updated for the digital era \\u2014 and appears to be accelerating in prevalence in the political sphere.\", \"At stake can be millions of dollars in an era when mass online political donating is in vogue in both parties. Copycatting Mr. O\\u2019Rourke\\u2019s brand surged in popularity recently, but on the Republican side, mimicking the brand of former President Donald J. Trump has been common for months.\", \"In some cases, established organizations are simply capitalizing on the day\\u2019s big news or the politician of the moment to gin up excitement among their own supporters with some verbal sleight-of-hand. In others, political action committees with anodyne names are raising funds in the name of a popular politician that they have no affiliation with at all. Mr. Pennington described such groups as \\u201cleeches\\u201d and \\u201cscam PACs.\\u201d\", \"Where the money goes from there can be murky, though big payments to the operatives and consulting firms that operate those PACs have drawn increasing scrutiny from political colleagues, regulators and law enforcement alike.\", \"Some of these operations are legal, sometimes burying the requisite disclaimers in the fine print. Others may not be. This month, the Justice Department charged three political operatives with running a scheme that prosecutors said defrauded small donors of $3.5 million.\", \"\\u201cI am not at all surprised that unscrupulous actors are essentially impersonating popular Democratic campaigns to try to raise money,\\u201d said Josh Nelson, a Democratic digital strategist who runs a firm, The Juggernaut Project, focused on growing email lists more ethically. \\u201cThat\\u2019s the unfortunate trend we\\u2019ve seen.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Nelson has been publicly pressuring progressives to abandon more deceptive fund-raising tactics, and has asked the leading Democratic technology companies to intervene because new laws are unlikely to stiffen penalties for deception anytime soon.\", \"\\u201cUltimately, I think it is going to take technology vendors cracking down on these tactics,\\u201d Mr. Nelson said.\", \"For now, there seems to be little that the most aggressive politicians and PACs in both parties won\\u2019t say to raise more money from online supporters.\", \"\\u201cYour covid test result,\\u201d read the alarming subject line of a fund-raising email from the campaign arm of House conservatives the day before Mr. O\\u2019Rourke entered the governor\\u2019s race. (The email was about mobilizing opposition to a Covid-19 vaccine mandate.)\", \"A new favorite tactic of the Republican National Committee has been making it appear as if supporters have urgent and overdue bills. \\u201cWARNING: Payment Incomplete\\u201d has been the sender line of more than 15 party emails since August, including one just before Thanksgiving. (A warning this week was about membership status as \\u201cTrump Social Media Founding Supporter.\\u201d)\", \"The day after Mr. O\\u2019Rourke\\u2019s announcement, the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, sent an email to supporters who had not ordered anything, using \\u201cYour Order Confirmation\\u201d as the sender and \\u201cOrder ID: 73G526S\\u201d as the subject line. (The email was an effort to sell \\u201cLet\\u2019s Go Brandon\\u201d wrapping paper, which references a popular conservative phrase that has become a stand-in for an insult aimed at President Biden.)\", \"The House Conservatives Fund, the Republican National Committee and Mr. Abbott\\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\", \"Some of these examples may seem like easily detectable and even harmless deceptions. But strategists in both parties say a huge share of online cash is raised from older Americans who are less adroit online and have a harder time separating fact from hyperbole. The reason that so-called Nigerian prince scams exist, after all, is because people fall for them.\", \"When Mr. O\\u2019Rourke ran for Senate in 2018, he shattered Democratic fund-raising records, and his entry into the 2022 governor\\u2019s race has been highly anticipated. His campaign team held discussions before the announcement about how to limit the funds that less scrupulous actors might try to cannibalize.\", \"And outside groups did pounce almost immediately.\", \"\\u201cOfficial: Beto is in!!\\u201d came one such message the morning his run was announced. It listed its sender as \\u201cTeam Beto (BSP).\\u201d\", \"The \\u201cBSP\\u201d stood for Blue South PAC, a new political action committee that sprung up this year and was among the more aggressive imitators of Mr. O\\u2019Rourke\\u2019s campaign. The group sent no less than five emails from a sender that included the phrase \\u201cTeam Beto\\u201d in the campaign\\u2019s first three days.\", \"\\u201cAt the very least, they\\u2019re trying to trick people into opening the email as if it\\u2019s from the campaign,\\u201d Mr. Pennington said, adding that he raced to send out the campaign\\u2019s first fund-raising message sooner than planned when he saw others already arriving.\", \"In one solicitation, the link to the Blue South PAC donation page on ActBlue, the Democratic digital donation-processing site, was highlighted in bright yellow and appeared as if it belonged to the campaign: actblue.com/donate/team-beto.\", \"Those who clicked were greeted by a message: \\u201cShow your support by donating and joining Team Beto!\\u201d Except 100 percent of the funds went to the Blue South PAC, according to the fine print on the donation page.\", \"A related group, Defeat Republicans, deployed a nearly identical email, featuring a similar URL highlighted in yellow: actblue.com/donate/official-beto.\", \"Both groups are linked to the same digital strategist, Zach Schreiber, who emailed a statement on behalf of both Blue South PAC and Defeat Republicans saying that their digital strategy was \\u201cin line with the industry best practices.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cOur community looks to us for news, action alerts, and opportunities to help elect Democrats,\\u201d the statement said, adding that the PACs \\u201clook forward to working with the Beto campaign.\\u201d\", \"Founded in the summer of 2020, Defeat Republicans raised almost $1 million in less than a year through the end of June 2021. In that time, federal records show it paid Mr. Schreiber $133,000 and directed another $208,000 to a firm, Opt-In Strategies, that lists him as a consultant on its website. Blue South PAC had spent only about $37,000 through the end of June, with more than one-third of the spending going to another consulting firm, UpWave Digital Solutions, founded by Mr. Schreiber.\", \"Federal records show that Defeat Republicans has given more than $400,000 to Democratic campaigns. The biggest chunk, $230,000, went to Jennifer Carroll Foy, who ran for governor of Virginia as a Democrat; Ms. Foy\\u2019s campaign paid Opt-In Strategies $67,500 for \\u201clist acquisition,\\u201d state records show. The PACs also said it had contributed $5,000 to Mr. O\\u2019Rourke.\", \"Plenty of other groups with missions that bear little relation to Mr. O\\u2019Rourke\\u2019s campaign seized on his entry into the race. These PACs have no formal affiliation with Mr. O\\u2019Rourke, even as they cite his campaign in fund-raising, and have no obligation to spend any of what they collect to help him.\", \"One PAC, The Majority Rules, ostensibly devoted to ending partisan gerrymandering, wrote an email to its list on Mr. O\\u2019Rourke\\u2019s first day that read, \\u201cThe first 24 hours after a campaign announces are critical to its success. We still need another 103 grassroots Democrats to step up before midnight to give Beto the momentum he needs.\\u201d\", \"All the funds went to the PAC.\", \"Another PAC, 314 Action, devoted to electing scientists, sent an email with the subject line \\u201cBREAKING: Beto is running for Texas governor\\u201d the day he entered the race. The funds went to the PAC. \", \"The sender line in that email displayed as \\u201cBeto O\\u2019Rourke Update\\u201d \\u2014 a format that industry insiders say can make it appear, at a glance, as if the politicians themselves sent the missive. (Directly using a politician's name alone without consent is generally not allowed because it is seen as writing directly in his or her voice without authorization.)\", \"A nonprofit arm of 314 Action has announced it will spend up to $500,000 this year targeting four Republican governors, including Mr. Abbott of Texas. Joshua Morrow, the executive director of the 314 Action groups, did not respond to questions about the group\\u2019s fund-raising tactics but said in a statement that Mr. Abbott is \\u201cat the top of the list\\u201d of \\u201canti-science politicians\\u201d they will target into 2022.\", \"314 Action uses other techniques to lure potential supporters, including sending three emails so far this month from \\u201cBREAKING from NBC News.\\u201d Another set of 314 Action emails used \\u201cNBC News Alert\\u201d in the sender line in September.\", \"Mr. Nelson, the Democratic digital strategist pressing his industry to curb such tactics, said groups keep doing it because it works \\u2014 at least in the short term. But he worries that over time bad actors could poison the well for the whole party if donors stop trusting political groups with their money.\", \"\\u201cUltimately there is a real risk that we\\u2019re going to push donors away,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"e66b26694ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e66b26694ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}},
