Griffith said the surgery would bring the world \\\"one step closer to solving the organ shortage crisis\\\", the University of Maryland School of Medicine said in a release.

He was bedridden for six weeks leading up to the surgery, attached to a machine which was keeping him alive after being diagnosed with terminal heart disease.\", \"\\\"I look forward to getting out of bed after I recover,\\\" he said last Thursday (local time).\", \"Exactly what will happen next is unclear. The pig used in the transplant had been genetically modified to knock out a gene which produces a sugar which would trigger an immune response in humans, AFP news agency reports.\", \"Griffith said they were \\\"proceeding cautiously\\\", carefully monitoring Bennett, while his son David Bennett Jr admitted to news agency AP they were \\\"in the unknown at this point\\\".\", \"But he added: \\\"He realises the magnitude of what was done and he really realises the importance of it.\\\"\", \"- BBC\"]","href_hash":"997021dc72a611ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"997021dc72a611ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
