but Covid has seen them hit a few snags.\", \"\\\"For example, the pool's made in Italy, the hydroslides are out of Australia, the heating system is out of Australia and those take specialist resources to put together and install on the site, and so border controls are quite an issue.\\\"\", \"He said it was like a jigsaw puzzle, booking in overseas specialists, nabbing them an MIQ spot and matching up the flights - while dealing with delays from local lockdowns.\", \"\\\"You rejig the programme on site to suit all those, then suddenly a flight gets cancelled, so then the person can't make the MIQ slot and then it knocks on to the site, as then you have to go through and re-plan and rejig it.\", \"\\\"So, it becomes quite a moving jigsaw puzzle to fit all these people into the project.\\\"\", \"Rahurahu said the lack of adequate facilities has meant the club's had to hold competitions in Dunedin or Wellington - at considerable cost.\", \"\\\"They're looking for to fund five nights of accommodation, plus transportation for a large team to get down there, which generally involves the bus,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"And if it's not a bus, parents are having to take their own vehicles down and find accommodation for themselves for that period of time.\", \"\\\"We're also sending down all of our technical officials and parent volunteer helpers and things like that. So, it's a huge logistical performance once a year, at everybody's personal cost really.\\\"\", \"But she said the last lap is hopefully within sight.\", \"\\\"If you build it, they will come. They will get national meets here, which means that we will get some of the fastest athletes in the country racing here.\", \"\\\"If we get an international meet here we will get some international athletes competing. And there's nothing that draws people into a sport like being able to see people they admire doing a fantastic job of it.\\\"\", \"Cox said it will be huge for the city's sporting culture.\", \"\\\"I had the privilege of growing up with QEII and just the memories and the history that people have of their experiences with the old QEII, but Parakiore is going to be the same.\", \"\\\"It's going to be a part of people as they grow up, whether they're visiting with school, having fun, or sporting success.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"9b38d508497111ec97285d17773d9493"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9b38d508497111ec97285d17773d9493"}},
