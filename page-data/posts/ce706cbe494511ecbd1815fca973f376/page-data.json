During the eclipse, around 99 percent of the visible face of the moon had moved into this shadow by the peak of the event, making it an almost total eclipse.\", \"As the moon moved into this shadow, the visible face became dimmer. But the moon was not plunged into complete darkness. Instead, it turned a reddish color around the time of maximum eclipse, due to the way that sunlight was being distorted as it passed through the Earth's atmosphere.\", \"Observers in North America were ideally placed to see the whole of the eclipse, depending on local weather conditions. But at least parts of the eclipse were also visible from other regions, including South America, Australia, much of Europe and Asia, and parts of northwest Africa.\", \"In the picture below, captured by photographer Andrew Caballero-Reynolds, the partial eclipse can be seen behind the Statue of Freedom on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. early on November 19, 2021.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936201/partial-lunar-eclipse-above-washington-dc.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The moon, with a partial lunar eclipse, is seen behind the Statue of Freedom, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. early on November 19, 2021.</div>\", \"This image, snapped by Philip Fong from the observation deck of Roppongi Hills in Tokyo, Japan, clearly shows the reddish hue that the moon took on during the eclipse.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936205/partial-lunar-eclipse-above-tokyo-japan.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The moon is seen during a lunar eclipse from the observation deck of Roppongi Hills in Tokyo on November 19, 2021.</div>\", \"Photographer Yuki Iwamura captured another spectacular shot of the moon on November 19 appearing behind One World Trade Center in New York City.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936208/partial-lunar-eclipse-above-new-york-city.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The moon is seen during a partial lunar eclipse above One World Trade Center in New York City early on November 19, 2021.</div>\", \"And in this image, taken from San Salvador\\u2014the capital of El Salvador\\u2014by photographer Emerson Flores, one portion of the moon appears to be visibly dimmer than the rest as our natural satellite moves through the Earth's shadow.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936209/partial-lunar-eclipse-above-san-salvador.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">View of the moon during a partial lunar eclipse on November 19, 2021 above San Salvador, El Salvador.</div>\", \"Lunar eclipses only occur during full moons, although they do not happen on every full moon night.\", \"Partial lunar eclipses occur when the Earth moves between the sun and the full moon, but the three bodies are not precisely aligned\\u2014like during a total lunar eclipse.
