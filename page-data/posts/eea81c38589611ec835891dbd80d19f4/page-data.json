But according to prosecutors, she also happened to be a woman in her 40s who had used the Social Security card information of her estranged daughter to get a driver\\u2019s license, enroll in a university and obtain financial aid.\", \"For about two years, Laura Oglesby, now 48, pretended to be in her 20s and used her daughter\\u2019s name, said Chief Jamie Perkins of the Mountain View Police Department in Missouri.\", \"\\u201cEverybody believed it,\\u201d Chief Perkins said. \\u201cShe even had boyfriends that believed that she was that age: 22 years old.\\u201d\", \"On Monday, Ms. Oglesby pleaded guilty to one count of intentionally providing false information to the Social Security Administration, according to the U.S. Attorney\\u2019s Office for the Western District of Missouri.\", \"Ms. Oglesby could face up to five years in federal prison without parole.

From April 1 to Sept. 30, there were more than 270,000 allegations of Social Security fraud, of which more than 167,000 were categorized as impostor schemes, according to a federal report.\", \"In some cases, parents unlawfully apply for loans using their child\\u2019s name, without their child knowing.\", \"By pleading guilty, Ms. Oglesby admitted that she had fraudulently applied for a Social Security card in January 2016 and later used it to apply for a Missouri driver\\u2019s license.

They were searching for Ms. Oglesby, who they said had stolen Ms. Hays\\u2019s identity in that state in 2017 to commit financial fraud and embezzle more than $25,000. The authorities in Arkansas told the Mountain View police that they believed that Ms. Oglesby had been living under the fake identity in Mountain View, Mo., a city about 40 miles north of the Missouri-Arkansas state line.\", \"The Mountain View police investigated and learned that Ms. Oglesby was living there and working at a city library, Chief Perkins said.\", \"\\u201cShe actually was employed here, which was kind of odd,\\u201d Chief Perkins said. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s how we figured out who she was.\\u201d\", \"The police then pulled her over during a traffic stop.
