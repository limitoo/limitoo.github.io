One is in Waikato, two in Rotorua, one in Christchurch and the rest are in Auckland hospitals.\", \"The average age of the current hospitalisations is 62.\", \"In Northland, seven of the 16 new cases today were first announced in yesterday's update.\", \"Of the nine remaining cases, six are in Kerikeri and three are in Whang\\u0101rei. The nine cases are under investigation to determine whether they are linked to existing cases, the ministry said.\", \"In Auckland, health and welfare providers were now supporting 2495 people in the region to isolate at home, including 997 cases.\", \"In Waikato, 12 of the new cases are linked to previous cases and three under investigation.\", \"Of these new cases, there are nine in Hamilton, one in Ohaupo, one in Te K\\u016biti, one in Huntly, one in Waimiha, and locations for the remaining three are under investigation, the ministry said.\", \"In Tair\\u0101whiti, the one new case is a household contact of an existing case and was already isolating when they tested positive.\", \"In Lakes, 11 of the 12 new cases are linked to known cases and one is under investigation.
