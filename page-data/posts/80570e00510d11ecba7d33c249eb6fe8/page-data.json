This means it could behave differently, and researchers have already said that early data suggests the variant could spread faster or resist natural or vaccine-induced immunity better than other variants\\u2014but this has yet to be proven.\", \"Since the variant was only detected weeks ago and widely reported just days ago, scientists are still uncertain about the risk it poses.\", \"But based on what we know so far about its many spike protein mutations, as well as a reported rise in cases in parts of South Africa where Omicron has been detected, some experts are concerned.\", \"Stephen Morse, professor of Epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, called for vigilance and expressed concern about the international response.\", \"\\\"The fact that we seem to be caught by surprise so often argues strongly for more systematic global viral surveillance, particularly genomic surveillance to spot these changes before a new variant gets a chance to spread worldwide.\", \"\\\"In the case of the Omicron variant, the sequence was first reported on November 11. This virus must have been circulating in southern Africa before then, so it may well have entered the U.S. already.\\\"\", \"Indeed, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, told NBC's Weekend TODAY on Saturday that \\\"a virus like this...is ultimately going to go essentially all over.\\\"\", \"\\\"You don't want to frighten the American public,\\\" he said, but stressed the development was something \\\"to take seriously.\\\"\", \"Morse added that the immediate concern is that Omicron could have \\\"the potential to be the next Delta,\\\" but there isn't enough data yet to tell.\", \"The variant has emerged at concerning time, too. The U.S. and many Western countries are entering the Christmas season, with travel likely on the horizon for many.\", \"Morse said he was worried about this, combined with a complacency surrounding mask wearing and other nonpharmaceutical interventions like social distancing and ventilation.\", \"For Andrew Pekosz, professor and vice chair of the W. Harry Feinstone Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology at Johns Hopkins University, part of the urgency lies in preparing national testing and sequencing capacity.\", \"He said that even if Omicron proves resistant to immunity, a largely immune population would still help lower its impact. \\\"For the general public, this is a reminder that if you haven't gotten a booster\\u2014go get one. If you haven't gotten the vaccine\\u2014go get it,\\\" he said.\", \"The World Health Organization (WHO) classified Omicron as a variant of concern last week.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1941319/covid-test.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A health worker prepares a COVID test at Sydney International Airport in Sydney, Australia, on November 28, 2021.
