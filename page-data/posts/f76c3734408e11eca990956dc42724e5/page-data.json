To go shopping was to be a metrosexual. To wear makeup was to apply guyliner. If we endeavored to explore our bodies with a trimmer, we were, ugh, manscaping. The goofiest of these portmanteaus, and one of the more enduring, involved the carryall. The murse, or the equally deplorable man bag, entered the pop-cultural conversation as a gender-normative joke: In 1998, Jerry Seinfeld\\u2019s TV alter ego, needing an alternative to his ballooning wallet, acquires a handbag (\\u201cIt\\u2019s not a purse, it\\u2019s European!\\u201d); a year later, in a \\u201cFriends\\u201d episode titled \\u201cThe One With Joey\\u2019s Bag,\\u201d the dopey soap opera actor struggles to give up his new accessory, even after it costs him an acting job. When he looks to his friend Rachel for advice, she stammers, \\u201cI\\u2019m not saying that you shouldn\\u2019t have a bag, I just \\u2026 it\\u2019s just there are other bags, you know, that are maybe a little less, um ... controversial.\\u201d\", \"Of course, there\\u2019s nothing controversial, or even new, about men\\u2019s bags. They have existed in various forms \\u2014 and under various noms de purse \\u2014 since the Middle Ages, when we were stuffing girdle pouches with flowers and spices to counteract some of the more fetid smells of the era. By the early 1900s, with the proliferation of passenger rail travel, men were packing sturdier bags and closing them with metal clasps, precursors to the modern briefcase. There was the field bag (a canvas haversack used by soldiers in both world wars), the satchel (worn across the body and popularized by Indiana Jones), and the tote bag (notably prevalent among readers of The New Yorker). There were bags for going to work, working out and weekends.\", \"Recently, though, we\\u2019ve seen something different. Taking a cue from the likes of Telfar Clemens, and Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton, more and more men, of all sexual orientations, are shouldering bags with smaller, sturdier, more traditionally feminine silhouettes. Whether it\\u2019s Young Thug and Lil Uzi Vert on Instagram with Chanel purses, or Dan Levy at the Met Gala in a custom look by Jonathan Anderson with Chlamydosaurus arms and a clutch silk-screened with a work by the 1980s East Village artist and AIDS activist David Wojnarowicz, the message is obvious: If ever there was a rule book for gendered accessories, it\\u2019s been torn up and incinerated. Julie Ragolia, a fashion stylist whose clients include Riz Ahmed and LaKeith Stanfield, thinks that bags are the next logical step in men\\u2019s wear\\u2019s liberation. \\u201cGender is an outdated ascription when it comes to fashion. We\\u2019re moving toward a place where taste is the true arbiter,\\u201d she says. \\u201cWomen\\u2019s purses offer greater options in terms of color, shape and size. There\\u2019s also the simple fact of utility. If a man is carrying a few dollars and a candy bar, it seems silly that he should choose a massive bag over a petite clutch, simply because of shop floor distinctions.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYOU\\u2019RE WELCOME!\\u201d SAYS Raul Lopez, the 32-year-old creative director of the rising Brooklyn-based label Luar, whose spring 2022 It bag, a boxy purse with a pair of ovoid handles called the Ana, has been carried recently by both Troye Sivan and Dua Lipa. \\u201cThanks to designers who keep pushing the agenda of genderless garments, when men think about purses, they aren\\u2019t just identifying it with what they buy their wives or girlfriends.\\u201d\", \"Other designers agree. As part of Dior Men\\u2019s resort 2022 collection, Kim Jones rendered John Galliano\\u2019s iconic Saddle Bag in black grained calfskin. At Celine, Hedi Slimane, long an adherent of androgyny, has released the leather-trimmed Ava bag, shaped like a croissant and covered in the French fashion house\\u2019s monogram-woven jacquard. For their so-called creative hacking this year, Gucci and Balenciaga each unleashed punky reinterpretations of Gucci\\u2019s Jackie 1961 bag, designed by Alessandro Michele for the label\\u2019s fall 2020 collection and since worn religiously by Harry Styles. Earlier this year, the fall 2021 runways saw a stampede of men with bags: at Jacquemus (where the French designer continued his play on proportion with oversize bags and others so small they would seemingly fit a single cashew), at Thom Browne (where the designer\\u2019s dachshund, Hector, continues to be immortalized in leather), at Bode (where a checkered purse mixed bravado with babushka) and at Amiri (where a model carried one shaped like a billiards eight ball).\", \"And yet, even the most outlandish of these bags has trouble being heard over the din of its attendant outfit. The truth is, men\\u2019s wear has become so jubilant, so free-spirited, so loud, that it\\u2019s hard for a purse to steal the spotlight. What was once a punch line on two of the biggest sitcoms \\u2014 a dig, make no mistake, directed at any expression of manhood that dared extend past the perimeter of prime time \\u2014 has become an afterthought. An elegant, practical, increasingly profitable yawn. And that\\u2019s a good thing. \\u201cThe more we can blur the lines between what is distinctively male and female, the closer we get to seeing one another as humans, to knowing each other more intimately,\\u201d says Ragolia. \\u201cIs a purse our societal or psychological savior? Perhaps not. But steps are steps.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f76c3734408e11eca990956dc42724e5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f76c3734408e11eca990956dc42724e5"}},
