On seemingly every surface fresh marigold blossoms glowed a bright orange.\", \"And, in this town just north of San Diego, two types of masks were present at its recent D\\u00eda de Muertos event: faces painted white and black to resemble skulls as well as the more familiar kind \\u2014 cloth coverings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\", \"The virus we\\u2019ve been living alongside for nearly two years has left us grappling with a staggering, unfathomable level of loss. On Monday, the official worldwide death toll from Covid-19 hit five million.\", \"In California, the pandemic has imbued D\\u00eda de Muertos, the annual tradition also known as Day of the Dead, with particular, painful significance.\", \"Covid-19 has killed more than 32,000 Latinos in California, giving the group the highest death rate of any race or ethnicity in the state.\", \"Naimeh Woodward, president of Encinitas Friends of the Arts, which hosted this weekend\\u2019s D\\u00eda de Muertos celebration, told me, \\u201cThis year, it\\u2019s really relevant more than ever.\\u201d\", \"D\\u00eda de Muertos ceremonies remember and honor the dead, typically around Nov. 1 and 2 \\u2014 All Saints\\u2019 Day and All Souls\\u2019 Day on the Catholic calendar.

These altars, or ofrendas, are meant to entice departed loved ones to briefly return to the land of the living.\", \"I saw ofrendas adorned with mangos, sweetbreads, cans of Tecate and glass bottles of Coca-Cola.

By contrast, white Californians make up 30 percent of that age group but 12 percent of its deaths.\", \"There are several reasons: Latinos are more likely to have poor access to medical care, work essential jobs that can\\u2019t be done remotely and live in crowded, multigenerational homes where the virus can easily spread.\", \"The mortality gap is likely to persist as long as the pandemic does, and may even widen. In recent months, a lower rate of Covid-19 vaccination has emerged among Latinos.\", \"For all communities in California, the toll of the pandemic has been extraordinary, and far more than we could have imagined back in March 2020. Last month, California surpassed 70,000 deaths from Covid-19.\", \"This is a scale of devastation typical in wars and the most horrific of natural disasters.
