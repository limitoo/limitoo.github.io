Nizar Qaddoura, the operations manager of the Salem Al Makrani Cargo company, told The Associated Press the Al Salmy 6 encountered rough and stormy weather, then capsized.  \\u00a0  Rescuers had saved 16 crew members, the captain said. Another 11 had made it onto a life raft, while one person was saved by a nearby tanker. Two crew members were still in the water, he said. \\u00a0  The crew consisted of nationals from Sudan, India, Pakistan, Uganda, Tanzania and Ethiopia, Qaddoura said. The vessel had been on its way to Umm Qasr, Iraq, carrying cars and other cargo, he said.  \\u00a0  The vessel was some 30 miles off the coast of Asaluyeh, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. IRNA said Iranian rescuers were trying to reach the vessel. \\u00a0  Images released by IRNA and Iranian state television matched with earlier images of the Al Salmy 6, a roll-on, roll-off vehicle carrier.  \\u00a0  The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which patrols in the Mideast, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \\u00a0  The Persian Gulf remains a major waterway for trade, ranging from cargo ships that transship onto the rest of the world and energy shipments from the oil-rich Gulf Arab states. \", \"Vessels sinking in the waterway remain incredibly rare. However, dust storms and other poor weather have swept across the region as the seasons change from relatively cold winter months to the scorching days of summer. \\u00a0  Severe weather pounded the Persian Gulf starting on Wednesday, the state-run Iran Meteorological Organization reported, warning of powerful wind gusts that would disrupt maritime activities in the gulf and damage offshore facilities through Saturday. Wind speeds are expected to exceed 40 mph in Iran's Bushehr province. \\u00a0 \\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"a73f4fc0a5d411ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a73f4fc0a5d411ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
