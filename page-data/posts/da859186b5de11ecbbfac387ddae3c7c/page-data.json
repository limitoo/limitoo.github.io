Ray moved into his daughter's dorm after getting out of prison.\", \"Ray was charged with racketeering, sex trafficking, conspiracy, forced labor and other crimes.\", \"In some instances, Ray convinced his alleged victims that they had poisoned or otherwise harmed him, and that they needed to pay him back, prosecutors said.\", \"One woman testified that she became a sex worker to try to pay reparations to Ray after becoming convinced that she had poisoned him. She said that, over four years, she gave Ray $2.5 million in installments that averaged between $10,000 and $50,000 per week.\", \"Ray's lawyers maintained he was victimized by former friends who fabricated their stories.\", \"Ray, who has been incarcerated since his early 2020 arrest, did not testify. Twice, the trial was interrupted as he was taken to the hospital in an ambulance for undisclosed illnesses.\", \"Several of the students testified that they were drawn into Ray's world as he told them stories of his past influence in New York City politics, including his role in ruining the career of former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik after serving as the best man at his wedding years earlier. Ray had, in fact, been a figure in the corruption investigation that derailed Kerik's nomination to lead the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\", \"Some of the students agreed to live with Ray in the summer of 2011 at his Manhattan one-bedroom apartment, where his sinister side emerged as he started to claim that the students had poisoned and harmed him.\", \"To make amends, they testified, they did what he asked, including turning over money. One man said he gave Ray over $100,000.\", \"Prosecutors said the money was never enough, though. Through threats and violence and videotaped \\\"confessions,\\\" Ray tightened his hold on the young people, including forcing them to work at the North Carolina home of his stepfather for weeks in 2013, they said.\", \"The allegations against Ray attained public prominence with the 2020 publication of \\\"The Stolen Kids of Sarah Lawrence,\\\" a\\u00a0New York magazine feature.\"]","href_hash":"da859186b5de11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"da859186b5de11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
