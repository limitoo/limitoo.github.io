It's quite possible that the eruption that's just occurred is the largest eruption of a sequence that might tail off over time and if that's the case, it would be unlikely to produce broad tsunami impacts around the Pacific.\", \"\\\"But if we have an eruption of a similar size and the vent is submerged beneath the sea surface, then it's quite plausible that we see the same kind of impacts in the future.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"a16bdc7e76a111ec88f817243e10b56d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a16bdc7e76a111ec88f817243e10b56d"}},
