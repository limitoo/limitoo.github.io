Larry Hogan of Maryland, whose state is facing a surge that has led him to expand hospital capacity and limit elective surgeries, won\\u2019t enforce any lockdowns or mandates. Mr. Hogan said on the program \\u201cFox News Sunday\\u201d that the state is \\u201ctrying to do everything we can\\u201d to get the remainder of its state vaccinated \\u2014 except for more mandates. \\u201cWe are not anticipating any lockdowns at all,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe are not considering them.\\u201d\", \"But the state\\u2019s uptick is troubling, Mr. Hogan said: \\u201cI would say, in the next couple of days, Omicron is going to be the dominant variant in our state.\\u201d \", \"Maryland\\u2019s seven-day rolling average is 1,340 daily cases. \\u201cWe are anticipating, over the next three to five weeks, probably the worst surge we\\u2019ve seen in our hospitals throughout the entire crisis,\\u201d he added. \", \"Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey is also battling spiking Covid cases and overwhelmed hospitals, still from the Delta variant. \", \"\\u201cEvery time you think you got it figured out, it takes a turn you don\\u2019t expect,\\u201d Mr. Murphy said on the program \\u201cFox News Sunday.\\u201d He added, \\u201cThis is unrelenting. There\\u2019s an enormous amount of fatigue out there, as it relates to this virus.\\u201d\", \"And while a lockdown isn\\u2019t likely, it hasn\\u2019t been completely ruled out, he said. \\u201cYou have to leave it on the table, but I don\\u2019t see it,\\u201d he said, citing the state\\u2019s highly vaccinated population, including residents who have gotten a booster shot. \\u201cAs fatigued as they are, they are largely accepting of what you need to do to push back at this \\u2014 and for the time being, at least, we think that\\u2019s going to work for us.\\u201d\", \"At least 70 percent of New Jersey residents are fully vaccinated, according to a Times database, putting it in the top states for inoculations. Cases have been doubling in recent weeks, with New Jersey reporting a rolling seven-day average of about 5,500 daily cases. Mr. Murphy did not follow New York\\u2019s governor, Kathy Hochul, in implementing a recent mask mandate, saying it was not necessary at the time. But he said it would remain an option. \", \"\", \"Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado on Sunday voiced cautious optimism about his state\\u2019s coronavirus numbers, citing a free at-home testing program and vaccinations.\", \"Colorado reported on Saturday a seven-day rolling average of about 1,500 daily cases, down from November numbers. Mr. Polis maintained that he would not impose a mask mandate, something he has said should be up to local officials. \", \"\\u201cWe have a lot less hospitalizations than we did a few weeks ago,\\u201d Mr. Polis said on the NBC program \\u201cMeet the Press.\\u201d \", \"He cited pandemic fatigue as a reason to avoid more restrictive measures for now and said that vaccinations would be enough to keep the variant at bay. \\u201cPeople just don\\u2019t react well to this ongoing environment of fear for two years,\\u201d Mr. Polis said. He added, \\u201cGetting three doses of the vaccine is highly effective and all but negates any risk that you face.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Biden administration\\u2019s top Covid adviser, disagreed. \\u201cI know it is certainly much more of a crisis of the unvaccinated. But there are other tools besides vaccine, and wearing a mask complements the protection that you get from the vaccine and a boost,\\u201d he said Sunday on the ABC program \\u201cThis Week.\\u201d\", \"He urged even those who are vaccinated to wear a mask regularly. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think you should be in a situation that if you\\u2019re vaccinated, you don\\u2019t ever have to worry about wearing a mask,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"4df8fcfc610c11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4df8fcfc610c11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
