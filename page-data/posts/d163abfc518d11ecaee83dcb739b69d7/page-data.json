Deputy Shane Reti became interim leader and the vote for leader was set down for today.\", \"Today's contest appears to be a showdown between Bridges and political novice Chris Luxon, who seems to have an edge in support from the caucus.\", \"Bridges, arriving at Wellington Airport this morning, had a positive attitude despite the ructions of last week and most pundits giving Luxon the edge.\", \"\\\"Really good, I think it's gonna be a good day, a good day for the National Party,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"That's because I think we'll draw a line under the past, be able to really take a government focus on what matters to New Zealanders and the solutions that are required and I think win the next election.\", \"\\\"So I feel really good about today.\\\"\", \"Rotorua MP Todd McClay was also positive about the day, despite the gloomy, drizzly weather in the capital.\", \"\\\"I think it's a great day to select a new leader for the National Party ... the one thing we've heard from our members is they want us to be united as a caucus. Really good conversations over the weekend and I think we're going to come out with a great result today.\", \"\\\"Not worried about anything, the National Party will make the right decision today, the caucus is really focused.

We've had a terrible year and a half and this is our opportunity to get it right.\", \"\\\"We've got an election to win in 2023 and I'm confident that we can do that ... with anyone that we choose today it will be achievable. We will be on track for 2023.\\\"\", \"She was keen for the party to put the past week behind it.\", \"\\\"I'm worried about what happened last week. That wasn't where we needed to be and I'm sure this afternoon that we'll come out with a decision that works us into a good place whoever wins.\", \"\\\"I hope everybody uses this as an opportunity to pick up their game - everyone - and that's where I sit, because you know there's so much we need to deal with right now that the government's doing that we can't afford any more games, and I'm not tolerant of games.\\\"\", \"She kept quiet about who she would support, but said it would be a \\\"genuine contest\\\".\", \"List MP Harete Hipango said today's result would be a \\\"reset and a refresh\\\", but would not say if that meant Luxon.\", \"\\\"I would like to see the best people because it's not just about the leader ... it's about the deputy and it's about the caucus as a whole.
