His company-issued business card reflects his status: \\u201cC.J. mayor of Rockefeller Center.\\u201d\", \"And each winter, as countless visitors arrive to see the Christmas tree outside 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Mr. Jones essentially becomes the tree concierge.\", \"In New York City, where doormen traditionally serve as everything from security guard to confidant, Mr. Jones, 59, holds one of the profession\\u2019s most prestigious posts. From now until the tree comes down in early January, he will dispense all of the particulars about it to those who ask: that this year\\u2019s version is a 79-foot-tall Norway spruce from Maryland decorated with 50,000 lights and a crystal-laden star that weighs nearly a half-ton.\", \"If they inquire further, he may tell them the tree is almost 90 years old and was cut down \\u201cat the end of its life.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe would never kill a tree in its prime,\\u201d Mr. Jones told a visitor on Wednesday as he slalomed between workers setting up equipment for the annual tree-lighting ceremony.\", \"In addition to tree questions, he fields a nonstop litany of other requests: directions to stores, restaurant recommendations, and, most urgently, where is the bathroom? (He directs those who ask to the restrooms in 30 Rock\\u2019s underground concourse.)\", \"Mr. Jones works the plaza the way a seasoned party host works a room, zipping around energetically.\", \"\\u201cIs everybody OK?\\u201d he asked visitors on Wednesday. \\u201cEverybody good? Ladies, you all right?\\u201d\", \"Mr. Jones\\u2019s nickname, C.J., is emblazoned on the name tag pinned to his sharp gray suit, which matches his hat and silver tie. And his caricature \\u2014 \\u201cMayor of the Rock\\u201d \\u2014 has graced Rockefeller Center holiday maps alongside illustrations of institutions like NBC, the Rainbow Room, and the Rockettes.\", \"The job has allowed him to meet presidents and to appear in front of television cameras, from spots on \\u201cToday\\u201d to doing schtick with Dan Aykroyd and dancing with Jimmy Fallon on \\u201cThe Tonight Show.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s more than a doorman or even a greeter,\\u201d said Pedro Francisco, a concierge in the 30 Rock lobby. \\u201cHis personality is on display here \\u2014 he\\u2019s part of the fabric of Rockefeller Center.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Francisco said that Mr. Jones knows most of the prominent figures who work at the NBC studios, including shows like \\u201c30 Rock\\u201d and \\u201cSaturday Night Live.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe knows all the movers and shakers working here, the celebrities, the titans of business, the \\u2018Today\\u2019 show folks,\\u201d Mr. Francisco said. \\u201cThey all stop to bounce things off him because of his personality and because he has a finger on the pulse on what\\u2019s happening.\\u201d\", \"The brushes with fame are great, Mr. Jones said, but so is collecting clippings from the tree to hand out to the crowd every winter. And no matter who he meets on the job, his companion, Evelyn, keeps him humble.\", \"\\u201cThe job never gets to my head,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbecause when I get home, she says, \\u2018You may be the mayor of Rockefeller Center, but when you come home, you\\u2019re just C.J.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Mr. Jones, a lifelong Brooklyn resident who now lives in Flatbush, said he grew up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood and aspired to go into politics but ultimately shied away because \\u201cit\\u2019s a dirty business.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThat never worked out,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut in a way it did, because now I\\u2019m the mayor of this place.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Jones graduated from the New York School of Printing in Manhattan (now known as the High School of Graphic Communication Arts) and worked briefly at a commercial printing company.\", \"\\u201cI couldn\\u2019t take the ink under my fingernails,\\u201d he said, \\u201cso I quit.\\u201d\", \"He took a security guard job at the Peninsula Hotel before switching to the coat check room at the University Club of New York and then moving up to doorman.\", \"After two decades at the club, one of its members, Rob Speyer, the chief executive of the Tishman Speyer real estate firm, which owns Rockefeller Center, asked Mr. Jones whether he would like to work there. Mr. Jones initially declined.\", \"\\u201cI turned down the job because I didn\\u2019t want to be cooped up inside behind a desk,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut then when they told me I\\u2019d be outside greeting people, I knew I had to take it.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe hospitality business fit better with my personality,\\u201d he said.\", \"An avid sports fan, Mr. Jones said he pays his dues as a supporter of the oft-struggling Mets and Jets. Once a Knicks fan, he has switched his allegiance to the Brooklyn Nets because their home, Barclays Center, is near his own.\", \"Mr. Jones has a daughter and two granddaughters, one 11 and the other seven months. He said the girls occupied much of his free time.\", \"\\u201cMy weekends are spent doing what the Mrs. needs me to do and spending quality time with my grandkids,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Jones called this holiday season especially sweet, after the coronavirus pandemic dampened last year\\u2019s turnout and forced the tree-lighting ceremony to be closed to the public.\", \"\\u201cThere was a time last year during the pandemic when it was just me and the pigeons out here \\u2014 it was a ghost town,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut the tourists are coming back. A lot of New Yorkers complain about the crowds, but they don\\u2019t realize how much this city depends on tourists. We take them for granted. We\\u2019ve all got to share this big city.\\u201d\", \"Bopping nonstop from one group of visitors to the next, he was difficult to keep up with.\", \"\\u201cSorry,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbut being mayor, you got to be visible.\\u201d\", \"He told a woman asking about the Lego Store that it had moved from the plaza to Fifth Avenue and 51st Street.\", \"\\u201cWhere\\u2019s the giant menorah?\\u201d one woman asked through her face mask. Mr. Jones directed her up Fifth Avenue toward 59th Street.\", \"When Maribel Abreu, who was visiting from North Carolina, asked where her family might watch the tree-lighting, Mr. Jones advised them to get a few hours rest and head for the plaza\\u2019s 50th Street entrance.\", \"Then he playfully blocked the stream of passers-by so she could snap a family photo. Ms. Abreu pulled him into the picture as well.\", \"Neil Lawner, a photographer from Manhattan, stopped to say hello.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s a great spokesman for this place because he\\u2019s so great with people,\\u201d Mr. Lawner said of Mr. Jones.\", \"Nicole Nieves and her grandmother, Abby Nieves were visiting from Montclair, N.J. They asked Mr. Jones for the free postcards Rockefeller Center offers each year.\", \"He trotted into the 30 Rock lobby to replenish his supply and soon returned with their cards. He said he typically handed out up to 40,000 every holiday season.\", \"\\u201cI got the best job in the world,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve met people from more than 100 countries. A lot of them come back years later and thank me for sending them to some restaurant or store. That makes me feel good.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"39996f4854ec11ecace8b7bad40206c8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"39996f4854ec11ecace8b7bad40206c8"}},
