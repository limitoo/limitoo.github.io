This year\\u2019s dispatch is \\u201cThe Christmas Promise,\\u201d a story of polar opposite identical twins whose relationship is forever altered by a holiday homecoming gone wrong. Currently at No. 7 on the hardcover fiction list, the novel joins a bevy of other holiday best sellers, including \\u201cAll-American Christmas,\\u201d by Rachel Campos-Duffy and Sean Duffy (No. 5 on the hardcover nonfiction list); \\u201cThe Christmas Bookshop,\\u201d by Jenny Colgan (recently No. 8 on the trade paperback list); and J. K. Rowling\\u2019s \\u201cThe Christmas Pig,\\u201d which has been in the No. 1 slot on the children\\u2019s middle grade hardcover list for 7 weeks. Interestingly and somewhat perplexingly, there are no Hanukkah or Kwanzaa books on the best-seller list at the moment.\", \"STEELWORK Danielle Steel lands on the hardcover fiction list with \\u201cFlying Angels,\\u201d a novel about six young flight nurses during World War II. \\u201cI LOVED doing the research for this book,\\u201d she writes on her website. Her subjects work on special detail for the Army, joining rescue missions to transport wounded soldiers from the front line. Steel goes on, \\u201cThey were American, British and Australian women, with an incredible camaraderie between them, as brave as the men they saved. \\u2026 They carried out their mission, uncomplaining, risking their lives daily, like the men, giving of themselves, and only acknowledged by the governments they served more than two decades later.\\u201d Some Goodreads reviews gripe about historical inaccuracies and \\u201cfiller and fluff,\\u201d but these quibbles don\\u2019t appear to be standing in the way of sales.\", \"PATCHWORK Ann Patchett\\u2019s last book, \\u201cThe Dutch House,\\u201d spent 32 weeks on the hardcover fiction list, 30 weeks on the combined print and e-book fiction list, seven weeks on the trade paperback list and \\u2014 perhaps thanks to Tom Hanks\\u2019s narration \\u2014 11 months on the audio list. Now Patchett migrates over to the nonfiction side with an essay collection; \\u201cThese Precious Days\\u201d is now at No 7. This time, the audiobook is narrated by the author herself, and a quick sample indicates that her voice stacks up respectably against Hanks\\u2019s.\"]","href_hash":"4a83e322535b11ecae47fb21c8804243"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4a83e322535b11ecae47fb21c8804243"}},
