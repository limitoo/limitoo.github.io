The web campaign helped propel the album to become among the most popular in the nation, selling over 3,000 copies.\", \"On the ARIA chart, Australia's main music sales chart, \\\"Songs of Disappearance\\\" debuted at No. 5 among the nation's top 50 albums.\", \"This places it ahead of works by pop music superstars like Olivia Rodrigo and Dua Lipa.\", \"Proceeds from sales of the album will go to benefit bird conservation throughout Australia.\", \"The hype surrounding \\\"Songs of Disappearance\\\" comes as many bird species, and Australian wildlife in general, continue to be threatened by habitat loss.\", \"A study from Charles Darwin University found that one in six bird species in Australia were threatened, mainly due to habitat loss from brushfires, along with climate change. An additional estimate from BirdLife Australia found that the number of threatened birds may have shot up by as much as 25 percent.\", \"\\\"Most of Australia's wildlife is found nowhere else in the world, making its conservation even more important,\\\" according to the Australian Wildlife Conservancy (AWC). \\\"45 percent of our bird species are found only in Australia.\\\"\", \"Some of the indigenous birds featured on the album include the night parrot, whose song was \\\"entirely unknown to science until 2013,\\\" stated The Guardian, and the regent honeyeater, \\\"which is now so rare that it is literally losing its own voice out of loneliness.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"284a97be5e2211ecb14c0bf4e69db4e2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"284a97be5e2211ecb14c0bf4e69db4e2"}},
