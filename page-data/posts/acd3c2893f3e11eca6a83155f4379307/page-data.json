What she says in the footage cannot be made out due to the noise of the concert. According to the user, her requests were ignored.\", \"\\\"Security/staff at Astrofest tonight was practically useless,\\\" @wilsonleungg wrote in the same tweet. \\\"Saw unconscious bodies being DRAGGED out of the mosh pits while the show continued.

In a statement posted to Twitter just after midnight on Saturday, Scott said he was \\\"devastated\\\" by the event and pledged to help the city and the affected families.\", \"\\\"I am absolutely devastated by what happened last night,\\\" Scott wrote. \\\"My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted by what happened at Astroworld Festival. Houston PD has my total support as they continue to look into the tragic loss of life. I am committed to working together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need.
