Even its star, Ethan Hawke \\u2014 speaking to us as himself in two brief scenes that bookend the movie \\u2014 admits that, initially, he didn\\u2019t understand Ferrara\\u2019s script. His candor is comforting, and emboldening, encouraging persistence with a story whose destination seems as vague as its characters\\u2019 motivations.\", \"What\\u2019s clear is that the constraints of pandemic filmmaking were catnip to Ferrara, whose jittery camera patrols the deserted nighttime streets of a locked-down Rome alongside J.J. (Hawke), an elite American soldier on a mysterious undercover mission. This requires finding his twin brother, Justin (also Hawke), an imprisoned revolutionary whom we see being questioned and repeatedly tortured.\", \"Surveilled by shady foreign agents, J.J. creeps from one furtive encounter to another, constantly filming his progress. Pitiless, grainy close-ups capture him sipping tea with a mother and child \\u2014 perhaps his brother\\u2019s family \\u2014 in a blank apartment and, later, alongside a mullah in a mosque. A terrorist attack on the city may be imminent, but J.J. is otherwise engaged with a couple of slinky prostitutes (\\u201cThey\\u2019re both negative,\\u201d their madam helpfully advertises) and a beautiful Russian woman (played by the director\\u2019s partner, Cristina Chiriac) who\\u2019s forcing him to have sex at gunpoint. By this juncture, the only thing we know for sure is that Ferrara, bless his guttersnipe soul, is still bracingly, adamantly himself.\", \"Steadfastly shouldering this rambling, barely penetrable narrative, Hawke smoothly distinguishes the implacable intensity of J.J. from the delusions of his brother (whose messianic rantings recall Hawke\\u2019s startling performance as John Brown in last year\\u2019s Showtime drama \\u201cThe Good Lord Bird.\\u201d) Saddled with some of the film\\u2019s dippiest dialogue (\\u201cYou hate trees!,\\u201d he screams at his unidentified tormentors), Justin serves as the enfeebled, despairing conscience of a world seemingly abandoned by God and compassion alike.\", \"With its prickling, apocalyptic aesthetic and persistent paranoia, this spooky political thriller is all about a mood: conspiratorial, sinister, unsettled. Here, the accessories of pandemic life become even more ominous: A sanitizing team on the subway recalls plague thrillers like \\u201cContagion\\u201d (2011), and a suddenly-brandished thermometer pointed at J.J.\\u2019s forehead plays like a gun attack. When everyone is wearing a mask, how do we tell the good guys from the bad?\", \"Utterly baffling, yet never less than intriguing, \\u201cZeros and Ones\\u201d lingers in the mind. Even after you think you\\u2019ve brushed it off, its chilly tendrils continue to cling.\"]","href_hash":"bdb2df8a486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bdb2df8a486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}},
