We should hit that milestone in the middle of this week,\\\" she said.\", \"Most places outside Auckland that have not yet reached 90 percent vaccination rates, would reach the mid-to-high 80 percent by the end of December, she added.\", \"The next full review of the traffic light system will be in the week of 17 January.\", \"The prime minister said New Zealand residents and citizens in Australia would be able to travel back home on 17 January and instead of going into MIQ, would be able to isolate at home for seven days. But, she said, ministers would receive further advice on the Omicron variant in early January to ensure this decision was the correct one.\", \"\\\"This check-in will be to confirm that we remain comfortable with this next step in our reconnecting work.\", \"\\\"I won't pre-empt the outcome of the check-in now, but it makes sense to ensure we assess the next move against all the latest information and advice we have, including the relative effectiveness of the vaccine against the Omicron variant.\", \"\\\"Our view is that we'll know even more than that on first week of January. So it makes sense for us to review that information and then confirm comfort or if there is something to alarm us, then being willing to speak to that as well.\\\"\", \"Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said the Pfizer vaccine did \\\"seem to have a good level of efficacy against the Omicron variant, especially with that third dose\\\".\", \"\\\"Our key objective is to go into winter with our maximum population immunity,\\\" he said.\", \"By Christmas, 450,000 people would be due for their booster shot.\", \"He advised those who had taken their second vaccine dose six months ago to get a booster in order to gain full immunity.\", \"Bloomfield also said Pfizer had indicated that the time between the second dose and the booster shot could be brought down to three months, if there was a large outbreak or during winter.\", \"A large number of New Zealanders would be due for booster shots in March, April and May, Ardern added.\", \"The prime minister reminded unvaccinated people that a negative rapid antigen test result would also be accepted when travelling after the Auckland borders reopened this Wednesday.\", \"Police in Northland would decide which cars to check \\\"ensuring we don't have a large hold up of vehicles\\\" and others could legitimately help, so long as police were present, she said.\", \"\\\"Ultimately, it is operational so I won't be dictating how they [police] undertake them.\", \"\\\"Checkpoints can only be legally run by the New Zealand Police. Yes, they can have others in support of those checkpoints, compliance checks, like New Zealand Defence Force, community wardens, M\\u0101ori or Pacific wardens.
