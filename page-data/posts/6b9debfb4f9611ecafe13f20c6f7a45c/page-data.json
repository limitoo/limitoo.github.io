Rather, it is known as Delta, the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet.\", \"There are now seven \\u201cvariants of interest\\u201d or \\u201cvariants of concern\\u201d and they each have a Greek letter, according to a W.H.O. tracking page.\", \"Some other variants with Greek letters do not reach those classification levels, and the W.H.O. also skipped two letters just before Omicron \\u2014 \\u201cNu\\u201d and \\u201cXi\\u201d \\u2014 leading to speculation about whether \\u201cXi\\u201d was avoided in deference to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.\", \"\\u201c\\u2018Nu\\u2019 is too easily confounded with \\u2018new,\\u2019\\u201d Tarik Jasarevic, a W.H.O. spokesman, said on Saturday. \\u201cAnd \\u2018Xi\\u2019 was not used because it is a common last name.\\u201d\", \"He added that the agency\\u2019s best practices for naming diseases suggest avoiding \\u201ccausing offense to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional or ethnic groups.\\u201d\", \"The W.H.O. has promoted the naming system as simple and accessible, unlike the variants\\u2019 scientific names, which \\u201ccan be difficult to say and recall, and are prone to misreporting,\\u201d it said.\", \"Some researchers agree.\", \"Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan, said she conducted many interviews with reporters this year, before the Greek naming system was announced, and she stumbled through confusing explanations about the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. They are now known as Alpha, which emerged in the United Kingdom, and Beta, which emerged in South Africa.\", \"\\u201cIt makes it really cumbersome to talk about when you\\u2019re constantly using an alphabet soup of variant designations,\\u201d she said, adding, \\u201cUltimately people end up calling it the U.K. variant or the South African variant.\\u201d\", \"That\\u2019s the other big reason that the W.H.O. moved to the Greek naming system, Dr. Rasmussen said: The older naming convention was unfair to the people where the virus emerged. The agency called the practice of describing variants by the places they were detected \\u201cstigmatizing and discriminatory.\\u201d\", \"The practice of naming viruses for regions has also historically been misleading, Dr. Rasmussen said. Ebola, for example, is named for a river that\\u2019s actually far from where the virus emerged.\", \"\\u201cFrom the very beginning of the pandemic, I remember people saying: \\u2018We called it the Spanish flu. Why don\\u2019t we call it the Wuhan coronavirus?\\u2019\\u201d Dr. Rasmussen said. \\u201cThe Spanish flu did not come from Spain. We don\\u2019t know where it emerged from, but there\\u2019s a very good possibility it emerged from the U.S.\\u201d\", \"The W.H.O. encouraged national authorities and media outlets to adopt the new labels. They do not replace the technical names, which convey important information to scientists and will continue to be used in research.\"]","href_hash":"6b9debfb4f9611ecafe13f20c6f7a45c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6b9debfb4f9611ecafe13f20c6f7a45c"}},
