He joined Suu Kyi during the campaign for last year's election, and their attendance in Naypyitaw is the basis for the charge against violating COVID restrictions.\", \"Suu Kyi was previously charged with five counts. She is currently being tried on four of the charges, and the fifth charge has a trial pending.\", \"If she is found guilty, each charge carries up to a 15-year prison sentence plus a fine.\", \"Suu Kyi's trials are closed to the media and spectators.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942579/aung-san-suu-kyi-hearings-netherlands.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Myanmar's military government issued Aung San Suu Kyi a sixth corruption charge Tuesday involving former President Win Myint.

It was unclear when a verdict will be issued.\", \"Maung, who was chief minister of the Mandalay region, a major state-level post, was also detained when the army took over. He is 69 years old and reportedly suffers from leukemia.\", \"The cases are widely seen as contrived to discredit Suu Kyi and keep her from running in the next election. The constitution bars anyone sentenced to prison from holding high office or becoming a lawmaker.\", \"Suu Kyi's party won a landslide victory in last year's polls. The army, whose allied party lost many seats, claimed there was massive voting fraud, but independent election observers did not detect any major irregularities.\", \"Suu Kyi remains widely popular and a symbol of the struggle against military rule.\", \"The army's takeover was met by nationwide nonviolent demonstrations which security forces quashed with deadly force, killing nearly 1,300 civilians, according to a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.\", \"With severe restrictions on nonviolent protest, armed resistance has grown in the cities and the countryside to the point where U.N. experts have warned the country is sliding into civil war.\", \"Suu Kyi, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her nonviolent struggle for democracy, has not been seen in public since being taken into custody on the day of the military's takeover.
