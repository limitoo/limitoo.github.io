And it can certainly feel unsatisfying to people who are committed to reducing the toll of racism in the United States. But it is one of the lessons of the murder convictions last week of three white men in Georgia, in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man.\", \"I want to revisit the case this morning, because it has a broader relevance to American politics.\", \"By now, you\\u2019re probably familiar with the basic facts. Arbery was in a predominantly white neighborhood near his home in coastal Georgia on Feb. 23, 2020, when three men in pickup trucks chased and shot him.\", \"Racism played a clear role in the killing. One of the defendants used a slur shortly after the shooting, according to another defendant. All three had a history of sending online messages tinged with white nationalism.\", \"Nonetheless, the prosecutor in the case, Linda Dunikoski, decided mostly to ignore race during the trial. She accused the defendants of having a racist motive only once, in a single line of her closing argument. She instead portrayed them as lawless figures who killed a young man.\", \"Before the verdicts, some observers criticized the strategy, saying that Dunikoski was weakening her case by ignoring the defendants\\u2019 motive. \\u201cThere were a lot of people who thought that it should have been very central to her argument,\\u201d said The Times\\u2019s Richard Fausset, who covered the killing and the trial. One law professor accused Dunikoski of \\u201cwhitewashing\\u201d the facts. Another professor said that her strategy would be blamed if the defendants were acquitted.\", \"No doubt, it would have been. Dunikoski was deliberately leaving out a big part of the story. But she was doing so for a reason. (Or so it seems; she has not publicly discussed her strategy.) She evidently believed that emphasizing race would be a gift to the defense.\", \"It could cause the jurors \\u2014 all but one of whom were white \\u2014 to retreat to their ideological corners. Conservative jurors would be reminded that they often disagree with allegations of racism. Many political moderates disagree sometimes, too, especially if they\\u2019re white. On the other hand, any jurors likely to be appalled by the racial nature of the case \\u2014 three white men killing a Black man in broad daylight \\u2014 would recognize the role of race without needing to be told about it.\", \"It was a miniature version of a tension that runs through American politics.\", \"Progressive activists often point out \\u2014 accurately \\u2014 the central role that race and racism play in the U.S. Polls show, for example, that a large percentage of Americans feel racial animus. That animus helped fuel Donald Trump\\u2019s political rise, starting with his promotion of the lie that Barack Obama was born in Africa. And racial discrimination continues to shape our economy, schools, criminal justice system and more.\", \"Yet when activists try to combat racism by calling it out, they often struggle to accomplish their goals. Focusing on Trump\\u2019s racist behavior did not keep him from winning the presidency. The Black Lives Matter movement has mostly failed to implement its policy agenda on policing. Affirmative-action programs generally lose when they appear on the ballot \\u2014 including a landslide loss in California last year, helped by opposition from many Latino and Asian voters.\", \"Race-based strategies are especially challenging in a country where living standards have stagnated in recent decades: Working-class families of all races have reason to distrust the notion that they enjoy a privileged lifestyle. No wonder that Steve Bannon, the far-right political figure, once said that he wanted liberals \\u201cto talk about racism every day.\\u201d When they do, Bannon said, \\u201cI got \\u2019em.\\u201d\", \"The Arbery trial offers a reminder that calling out racism is not the only way to battle it. Sometimes, a more effective approach involves appealing to universal notions of fairness and justice.\", \"Another example is child poverty. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey was an early advocate of baby bonds \\u2014 universal savings accounts for children, an idea that helped shape President Biden\\u2019s focus on reducing child poverty. The beauty of the policy, Booker told me, is that it substantially reduces racial gaps in child poverty (because children of color are more likely to be poor) while still being inclusive.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s very hard to undo centuries of racial policies by suddenly saying, \\u2018I\\u2019m now going to not be conscious of race in America,\\u2019\\u201d he said. But, he added, \\u201cThis is a policy that I think can be embraced by you, whoever you are, whatever your background.\\u201d\", \"Representative James Clyburn, the highest ranking Black Democrat in Congress, made a similar argument when explaining why he favored a version of slavery reparations that would also help poor white families. \\u201cRace is the reason income is what it is,\\u201d he told The Washington Post. \\u201cThis is by design. So attack the design.\\u201d\", \"The downside of this approach is clear enough. Given the long history of intense racism in the U.S., universal programs will never fully solve the problem. Of course, policies that fail to get enacted accomplish much less.\", \"Dunikoski\\u2019s trial strategy may have felt uncomfortable to anybody repulsed by the defendants\\u2019 racism. But imagine how uncomfortable an acquittal would have felt.\", \"Arbery\\u2019s family members, notably, were not among Dunikoski\\u2019s critics, as Richard Fausset has reported. Even before the verdict, the family liked the prosecution\\u2019s approach.\", \"For more: On \\u201cThe Daily,\\u201d Richard broke down the trial in more detail, with help from courtroom audio clips.\", \"Three views as the Supreme Court prepares to hear a case that could restrict abortion rights:\", \"Charles Fried once urged the court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Now he thinks doing so would be \\u201can act of constitutional vandalism.\\u201d\", \"Roe may fall even as conservatives have adopted the \\u201cmy body, my choice\\u201d slogan, Michelle Goldberg writes.\", \"\\u201cAbortion is a form of killing\\u201d: Ross Douthat makes the pro-life case.\", \"Horse troughs and hot tubs: Baptism is getting a little wild.\", \"Invasion: Bradford pears were the ideal tree for the suburbs.

He died at 87.\", \"There was the black tennis tutu for Serena Williams at the U.S. Open in 2018, and the custom harness Timoth\\u00e9e Chalamet wore on the red carpet. There were seemingly endless designs featuring quotation marks, and sneakers playfully adorned with security tags. But those were just the objects; the legacy of their designer, Virgil Abloh, extends far beyond material goods.\", \"Abloh, who died on Sunday at 41 of a rare cancer, was the artistic director of Louis Vuitton men\\u2019s wear and the founder of his own line, Off-White. Only a few months ago, he took on a more expansive role at LVMH, making him the most powerful Black executive in the most powerful luxury group in the world, The Times\\u2019s Vanessa Friedman writes.\", \"With degrees in engineering and architecture, Abloh was a latecomer to fashion. Growing up, he embraced skate culture and hip-hop, and their influences were clear in his work. \\u201cHe wasn\\u2019t known for his mastery of fashion\\u2019s technical skills, but he understood popular culture and what it meant to move through the world using clothing as a signifier of belonging,\\u201d Robin Givhan writes in The Washington Post.\", \"Abloh\\u2019s approach transformed men\\u2019s wear. As Rachel Tashjian writes in GQ: \\u201cThe industry currently operates in the mold he created \\u2014 collaboration crazy, streetwear heavy, pairing unlikely businesses and talents together, treating brands like Evian and Arc\\u2019teryx as sacred and intriguing as any luxury house, and cultivating a community rather than mere customers.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cLook around at the way young men now think about clothes, design and music, and the ways in which those pursuits all intersect,\\u201d Jon Caramanica writes in The Times. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard not to see Abloh everywhere.\\u201d \\u2014 Sanam Yar, a Morning writer\", \"These cherry rugelach are tender and coated with cardamom sugar.\", \"Move over, \\u201cFriends.\\u201d Step aside, \\u201cThe Office.\\u201d Twitch and YouTube streamers are becoming the go-to for comfort viewing.\", \"Adele, Summer Walker, Taylor Swift: It\\u2019s the season of raw albums about romantic discontent.\", \"The hosts had a lot to say about Omicron.\", \"The pangram from yesterday\\u2019s Spelling Bee was motivation.
