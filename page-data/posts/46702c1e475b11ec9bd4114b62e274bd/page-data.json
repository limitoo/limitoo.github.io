have\\u00a0received during a \\\"roller-coaster\\\" week.\", \"Ori and Lindsey Zavros,\\u00a0and their children Zoe and Zane, had been travelling around Australia in their customised campervan when they became bogged in the remote Simpson Desert, about 150 kilometres\\u00a0north-east of Oodnadatta.\", \"They spent five days stranded in the outback before being rescued yesterday, and taken by helicopter to Coober Pedy where they spent the night at a hotel.\", \"Speaking to the ABC today, Mrs Zavros said she was feeling\\u00a0\\\"grateful, excited, exhausted\\\" after the ordeal.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Didn't get much sleep last night with all the thoughts going through our head, but it was really nice to be clean that's for sure,\\\" Mr Zavros said.\", \"The couple\\u00a0had enough food and water to stretch to about two weeks if they had to, but were worried about their two young children who they kept inside to stay safe\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0and clean.\", \"\\u201cThat was one of the more scary things,\\\" Mrs Zavros said.\", \"\\\"Because we knew we were in the middle of nowhere, we didn\\u2019t want the kids to go outside and play and get stuck in mud or get hurt on anything because we can\\u2019t just take you to the hospital,\\\" she said.\", \"\\u201cWe couldn\\u2019t afford to use water to wash them, so that\\u2019s why they were stuck inside \\u2014 they would normally be out in the mud all day building mud castles and all sorts but unfortunately we couldn't do that,\\\" Mr Zavros said.\", \"The family experienced a \\\"massive storm\\\" on their first night in the desert, but it was not until a few days later that they became bogged.\", \"\\\"Once the truck started to sink down I knew we were in trouble,\\\" Mr Zavros said.\", \"They sent off their emergency beacon and waited for help.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5cb79e9d22957e3c648e2e025295a6c7\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">

operation\\\".\", \"\\\"It was a great effort by everyone involved, so we'd just like to say thanks and yeah, it was a great outcome for that family,\\\" she said.\", \"<img

helicopter had to refuel multiple times to even just get to Marla, which is over 1,000 kilometres away, and then head out to the family and pick them up, and then refuel again at Oodnadatta where some more drums of jet fuel had been dropped off,\\\" she said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d171b35f8abed4fdd724ad36b6f510ba\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

family activated\\u00a0their Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon\\u00a0device, which allowed emergency services to locate their exact position.\", \"\\\"When they launch\\u00a0air assets, the beacon continuously transmits a signal which [means] the helicopter or aeroplane can hone in and find them,\\\" he said.\", \"Mr Atkinson said the family followed the right protocols such as\\u00a0bringing plenty of water and staying with their vehicle, but despite the best planning issues can still arise.\", \"\\\"The roads weren't\\u00a0closed at the stage that they went through and then after they'd gone in there, the roads then closed behind them that meant no other travellers could find them on the way through,\\\" he
