Trump is publishing a book of photographs celebrating his time as president, according to a statement from his office. Titled \\u201cOur Journey Together,\\u201d the book includes more than 300 photographs and captions written by Mr. Trump.\", \"The book will be released on Dec. 7. It\\u2019s being published by Winning Team Publishing, an imprint started by Sergio Gor, who worked for Mr. Trump\\u2019s re-election campaign in 2020, according to Mr. Gor. (The Associated Press reported that Donald Trump Jr. co-founded the company, but Mr. Gor did not immediately respond to questions about Donald Trump Jr.\\u2019s role.) It\\u2019s unclear if Mr. Trump shopped the book around to traditional publishers, but several industry executives said they hadn\\u2019t heard about the book.\", \"\\u201cOur Journey Together\\u201d \\u2014 which is priced at $74.99, or $229.99 for a signed copy \\u2014 is not a comprehensive look back on his presidency. Rumors of a more exhaustive memoir by Mr. Trump have circulated in recent months. The former president has boasted of turning down offers from two publishers. This summer, in a statement released through his political action committee, Mr. Trump said he was \\u201cwriting like crazy,\\u201d and promised that \\u201cwhen the time comes, you\\u2019ll see the book of all books.\\u201d\", \"The photo compilation will be available for sale through Amazon and Barnes & Noble, and on a website called 45books.\", \"Several prominent figures from the Trump administration have signed major book deals, including Kellyanne Conway, Mike Pence and Jared Kushner. Some in the industry have questioned whether a large mainstream publisher would take on a memoir by Mr. Trump, given the controversy such a deal would likely generate. Others have expressed doubt that a book by Mr. Trump, who continues to insist that he won the 2020 election, would be factually accurate.\"]","href_hash":"2687ca12498911ec933aab8e7ded853e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2687ca12498911ec933aab8e7ded853e"}},
