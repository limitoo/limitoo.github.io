It's a mystery at the moment.\\\"\", \"Astronomer and former superintendent of the Mt John Observatory Alan Gilmore said it was unlikely that a meteor, or anything astronomical, was the cause of the noise.\", \"He said a meteor causing a boom heard on the ground might occur over the whole country once a year.\", \"\\\"Something to make a boom requires a sizeable rock to come down to a low level, closer than 60km from the ground, for the sound to even get to the ground and that's very rare.\", \"\\\"To have the same thing happen in the same place in the country a week apart doesn't sound at all likely. It sounds like there's something else going on in that area to make two booms in one week.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"c59f2e4e1ebf11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c59f2e4e1ebf11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
