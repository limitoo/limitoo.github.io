Surrounding her were pale wooden crates packed with himmelis bound for an exhibition in Switzerland in November.\", \"The himmeli belongs to a centuries-old tradition of straw art, which has a long list of different names in other countries. Its popularity in recent years had Ms. Koski exhibiting her work and teaching the art around Europe and in Japan.\", \"She and others say the ornament\\u2019s most captivating feature is its ability to create a near-hypnotic viewing experience: rotating slowly in a slight breeze or the updraft of a flickering candle.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a living thing; it moves, it listens to you, it talks to you, it creates energy,\\u201d Hiroko Sakomura, a cultural event producer in Japan, wrote in an email (she helped bring an exhibition of Ms. Koski\\u2019s work to Japan in 2016). \\u201cYou can find so many beautiful aspects and moments depending on the light and angle.\\u201d\", \"The ornament\\u2019s origin story varies: Some enthusiasts say it was designed to resemble church chandeliers, others that the network of geometric shapes reflects the harmony and regenerative power of the universe. A himmeli is often composed of shapes that are among the Platonic solids, theorized by the philosopher to be the basic elements of nature.\", \"According to an email from Jan Huss, an award-winning straw artist and lecturer based in California, the ornament is widely \\u2014 and mistakenly \\u2014 believed to be Finnish in origin. It actually appears throughout Eastern and Central Europe, Ukraine and Russia, Ms. Huss wrote, and is believed to have distant roots in North Africa.\", \"The ornament typically is used as a Christmas decoration in the Nordic countries; elsewhere it is hung at weddings and used to celebrate Easter and New Year\\u2019s Eve, according to Ms. Huss\\u2019s website, thestrawshop.com, which promotes straw art and sells books and supplies.\", \"The website says materials used to make the ornament vary geographically, as do the designs, with crafters in some countries \\u2014 for example, Lithuania \\u2014 producing rounder, less geometric pieces. Many use rye and wheat, while others rely on barley or reeds.\", \"Ms. Koski, 54, prefers to make her himmeli from rye, harvested each summer from the organic grain farm cultivated by her husband Kari and then dried in the sun.\", \"Nowadays, she said, crafters use a variety of materials, including glass, metal and even plastic drinking straws. \\u201cI have tried them all, but only once. After that, I came back to rye because it\\u2019s so light,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt moves. You just walk beside it and it starts to move.\\u201d\", \"To make an average-size ornament \\u2014 about 18 inches long by 16 inches wide \\u2014 she might use 800 pieces, stitching them by hand with mercerized cotton thread to create three-dimensional elements that she then assembles into a larger whole.\", \"Whether she is working on a traditional design or a modern pattern, the goal is always the same: to create precise shapes of perfect proportion. \\u201cWhen you watch the himmeli slowly spin, you should be able to see the movement of all the geometric patterns,\\u201d Ms. Koski said.\", \"How long does it take to craft a himmeli? \\u201cAbout a year,\\u201d she answered. \\u201cThat\\u2019s how long it takes the rye to grow.\\u201d It actually is a question she mildly resents, she said, because the meditative art of himmeli-making is something to get lost in: \\u201cFor me, the act of making a himmeli is just as important as the result.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Koski sells her himmelis online, with prices from 30 euros to 1,800 euros ($35 to $2,080) depending on size.\", \"She said she first fell in love with himmelis as a child while visiting her aunt, who had one on display. But then she more or less forgot about them until she met her husband in 1993 and his farm\\u2019s fields of organic wheat and rye inspired her to take a course in the nearby coastal city of Vaasa.\", \"\\u201cAt that course,\\u201d said Ms. Koski who, nearly three decades on, makes the ornaments daily and displays them year-round in every room of her house, \\u201cI realized, this is it. This is my thing.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9a774eee492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9a774eee492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}},
