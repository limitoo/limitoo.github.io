That enabled him to be taken out of the league\\u2019s health and safety protocols, according to the league.\", \"In keeping with their enhanced coronavirus protocols after Thanksgiving, N.B.A. officials collected a sample to test on Monday and received a positive result on Tuesday. They used another instrument to test the same sample, and that test returned an inconclusive result. Consequently, James was placed into the league\\u2019s health and safety protocols.\", \"James had been with the Lakers in Sacramento, where they were set to play the Kings on Tuesday night.

Many interpreted the tweet as implying he thought something unusual was happening with his coronavirus testing.\", \"James said before the season that he was vaccinated against Covid-19. Vaccinated players have been tested much less often than unvaccinated players this season. But given the higher chance players might have been exposed to the virus during Thanksgiving gatherings, the N.B.A. increased testing requirements for vaccinated players, according to a memo obtained by The New York Times.
