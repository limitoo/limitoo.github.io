The government's own budget proposal was rejected in favor of one presented by the opposition that includes the right-wing populist Sweden Democrats. \", \"The Sweden Democrats, the country's third-largest party, has roots in a national neo-Nazi movement, but has since disavowed fascism. \", \"The vote was 154-143 in favor of the opposition's budget proposal. \\u00a0 Andersson, leader of the Social Democratic party, decided it was best to step down from the post more than seven hours after she made history by becoming the first woman to lead the country. \\u00a0 \\\"For me, it is about respect, but I also do not want to lead a government where there may be grounds to question its legitimacy,\\\" Andersson told a news conference. \\u00a0 Andersson, who was finance minister before briefly becoming prime minister, informed parliamentary Speaker Andreas Norlen that she is still interested in leading a Social Democratic one-party government. \\u00a0 Norlen, the speaker of Sweden's 349-seat parliament, said he will contact Sweden's eight party leaders \\\"to discuss the situation.\\\" On Thursday, he will announce the road ahead. \\u00a0 Andersson said that \\\"a coalition government should resign if a party chooses to leave the government. Despite the fact that the parliamentary situation is unchanged, it needs to be tried again.\\\" \\u00a0 Even though the Green Party pulled its support for her government, it said it is prepared to stand behind Andersson in a new vote to tap a prime minister. But the Greens said it was in the best interests of the party to pull support for her after the budget defeat in parliament. \\u00a0 Andersson's appointment as prime minister had marked a milestone for Sweden, viewed for decades as one of Europe's most progressive countries when it comes to gender relations, but which had yet to have a woman in the top political post. \\u00a0 Andersson had been tapped to replace Stefan Lofven as party leader and prime minister, roles he relinquished earlier this year. \\u00a0 Earlier in the day, 117 lawmakers voted yes to Andersson, 174 rejected her appointment while 57 abstained and one lawmaker was absent. Under the Swedish Constitution, prime ministers can be named and govern as long as a parliamentary majority - a minimum of 175 lawmakers - is not against them. \\u00a0 Sweden's next general election is scheduled for September 11.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"505db2de4dfd11ec9ae663f7c63bc564"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"505db2de4dfd11ec9ae663f7c63bc564"}},
