a mixed reaction to the government's roadmap to opening WA's borders, with tourism operators expressing disappointment andÂ the business lobby urging the community to get vaccinated.","country":"au","create_time":"2021-11-05T07:20:47.000Z","content":"[\"The tourism and travel sectors have expressed deep disappointment the McGowan government has not set a date to reopen Western Australia, saying it is urgently needed to allow them to plan and visitors to book tickets.\", \"The state Opposition broadly welcomed the announcement of a plan \\\"of sorts\\\" to ease WA's controlled borders, but joined others in criticising the lack of a date for when that will happen.\", \"Earlier, Premier Mark McGowan said the domestic and international borders would open when 90 per cent of the state's population aged above 12 years old was fully vaccinated, estimated to be in late January or early February.\", \"A date will be set once the 80 per cent vaccination rate is reached, possibly in mid-December.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f610e48de3474a29e03137acce8d061c\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> A date for reopening the borders will be set when the vaccination rate hits 80 per cent.(ABC News: James Carmody)</div>\", \"Mr McGowan defended the decision as reflecting a \\\"cautious and safe\\\" approach that would allow businesses to operate at full capacity over the Christmas period.\", \"But for travel agents like Christian Hunter, it was another blow.\", \"He said the sector had essentially been in a hard lockdown for the past 20 months.\", \"\\\"It's been quite devastating,\\\" he said.\", \"Mr Hunter said it was great to now have a plan to work towards.\", \"\\\"But it is a bit of a blow to our sector that we don't have clarity around a date,\\\" he said.\", \"WA's Tourism Council\\u00a0said without a date for reopening, people could not book family reunions or other travel and tourism businesses could not recruit staff or plan to reopen.\", \"\\\"Every day\\u00a0WA remains without a date, we are at a disadvantage to other states for recruiting staff, attracting visitors and keeping tourism businesses going,\\\" the council's chief executive Evan Hall said.\", \"Mr McGowan acknowledged the delayed reopening would be frustrating for people who hoped to reunite with family or friends interstate or overseas at Christmas.\", \"But he pointed to Heath Department modelling, which found 200 extra people would die if\\u00a0WA opened up earlier at the 80 per cent vaccination rate, rather than at 90 per cent.\", \"The WA branch of the\\u00a0Australian Medical Association urged the government to use the time before reopening to concentrate on vaccination rates in country areas and Aboriginal communities.\", \"\\\"This extra time will allow us time to do childhood vaccination in the five to 11-year-old group, that is imminent for approval,\\\" AMA WA president Mark Duncan-Smith said.\", \"\\\"Also to get boosters undertaken, and also to allow the proper training of new doctors starting in January.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Plan 'very ambitious': Opposition</div>\", \"Opposition Leader Mia Davies gave her support to that health advice and the broad outline of the plan.\", \"<img

\\\"very ambitious\\\".(ABC News:\\u00a0Rhiannon Shine)</div>\", \"But she said the problem with not setting a date was\\u00a0that it eliminated an incentive to get vaccinated, which she argued explained why WA had the lowest vaccination rate in the country.\", \"\\\"[It's] very disappointing we still haven't seen a date set,\\\" Ms Davies said.\", \"\\\"It would appear we still have a great deal of uncertainty when it comes to allowing business in our community to plan what that safe opening will look like.\\u00a0\", \"She described it as a \\\"very ambitious plan\\\" and said it would require an enormous effort by government to get an extra 250,000 West Australians fully vaccinated and reach the 90 per cent threshold.\", \"\\\"What the government will need to do is invest significantly in getting people over the line that have been complacent or unable to access the vaccine,\\\" Ms Davies said.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'I think it is achievable'</div>\", \"But there was also praise for the government's plan.\", \"Talkback caller to ABC Radio Perth, Marina, 23, said she hoped it would encourage\\u00a0many of her friends who were hesitant to\\u00a0finally get the jab.\", \"\\\"Ninety per cent, I think it's high but I think it is achievable, once we start giving incentives, like you can't go clubbing , blah, blah, blah until you're fully vaxxed,\\\" she said.\", \"Stuart Laws, from the Chefs Collective, said he loved the 90 per cent vaccination target.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Having that 90 per cent just gives us a little bit of confidence that, when we do open the borders, we're not going to be in the position where we were in the beginning of 2020, when we were all running for the hills going 'where's my next paycheck coming from?',\\\" he said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/1ae3829067f49ac9f168dca9f006a7b6\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Some in the

operations and investments.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Now it's game on,\\\"\\u00a0the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) WA said in a statement, encouraging the community and WA government to \\\"do all it can to supercharge vaccination rates\\\".\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Together, we can bring the open date forward by several weeks from the current forecast of late January,\\\" the CCI said.\", \"<div

its first home game on November 20 against Adelaide and then play away games until Christmas Eve.\", \"\\\"That's something we'll be discussing with WA Police in the next week, see what can be done, if teams can fly in and stay for basically one night and fly straight out, in a bubble.\\\" Mr Pignata said.\", \"\\\"We don't want to come back and have to quarantine for 14 days because that will really impact our season, we don't want anything like that.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"db3234023e0811ec809e000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"db3234023e0811ec809e000017025a03"}},
