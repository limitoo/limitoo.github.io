His grandfather had many, but he told one more than others.\", \"In the mid-1920s, an American visited Dingle to study birds and collect specimens. Sometimes Mr. \\u00d3 Mainn\\u00edn\\u2019s grandfather would bring the man \\u2014 his name was Benjamin Gault, though the locals called him \\u201cKaerty\\u201d \\u2014 in his fishing boat to the nearby Blasket Islands. Kaerty always had a hand-cranked camera with him. One day, as he was filming Mr. \\u00d3 Mainn\\u00edn\\u2019s grandfather and his friends, the grandfather stuck a pipe in his dog\\u2019s mouth as a joke.\", \"\\u201cIt was a very far-out story,\\u201d Mr. \\u00d3 Mainn\\u00edn, 55, a farmer and fisherman in Dingle, said. \\u201cYou would never think that it was true.\\u201d\", \"Long after Mr. \\u00d3 Mainn\\u00edn\\u2019s grandfather, also named M\\u00edche\\u00e1l \\u00d3 Mainn\\u00edn, died in 1981, the family wondered whether any of the film shot by the visiting American still existed.\", \"Mr. \\u00d3 Mainn\\u00edn\\u2019s curiosity ultimately led to the discovery of a collection of silent film reels depicting life in 1920s Ireland \\u2014 police officers directing traffic in Cork City, horse-drawn carts piled high with wicker lobster pots, people attending horse races and Mass \\u2014 all shot in 1925 and 1926, in the early years of Irish independence from Britain.\", \"Footage of Ireland from that time \\u2014 a period when memories of the First World War were still fresh, and Ireland was recovering from its own civil war \\u2014 is incredibly rare. Most of the film that does exist is newsreel footage of major events, according to Manus McManus, the film collections and acquisitions manager for the Irish Film Institute.\", \"\\u201cThis stands out as quite unique in the sense of essentially recording the ordinary daily lives of people,\\u201d Kevin Rockett, a retired professor of Film Studies at Trinity College Dublin, said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s lots of footage of the war, so that was what people would be most familiar with.\\u201d\", \"Mr. \\u00d3 Mainn\\u00edn started his search in 2011 with little to go on beyond the American\\u2019s name, but he quickly found out that Mr. Gault was an ornithologist from the Chicago area. That led him to the Chicago Academy of Sciences, home to the Gault collection, which includes bird specimens, dried plants and, as he had hoped, old film.\", \"Mr. Gault\\u2019s films are not the only reels in the academy\\u2019s archives, but they are among the oldest. Dawn Roberts, the academy\\u2019s senior director of collections, was trying to raise money to digitize the reels when she received an email from Mr. \\u00d3 Mainn\\u00edn.\", \"The academy did not have the resources to digitize the Gault reels, but Ms. Roberts shared catalog notes with Mr. \\u00d3 Mainn\\u00edn along with scanned journal entries and photographs belonging to Mr. Gault. Mr. \\u00d3 Mainn\\u00edn brought those materials to the Irish Film Institute to see if it could help fund the digitization process.\", \"Mr. McManus had secured some funding from a nonprofit when Rob Byrne, the president of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, caught wind of the story. Mr. Byrne, who lives in Ireland, had been looking for an Irish project, and Mr. Gault\\u2019s reels presented a rare opportunity. The Silent Film Festival had a lot of experience with restoring silent films.\", \"\\u201cBecause the footage was shot by an American in Ireland, it\\u2019s fitting that, after nearly 100 years, the U.S.-Ireland connection endures,\\u201d Mr. McManus said.\", \"Mr. Gault shot on 35-millimeter nitrate film, which was rare for a hobbyist because it was a very professional and higher-resolution medium, Mr. McManus said. The downside is that nitrate is also unstable and flammable, which makes the film hard to preserve.\", \"\\u201cFirst of all, these are amateur films shot 100 years ago that, fortunately, nobody ever threw out,\\u201d Mr. Byrne said. \\u201cFilms like these are disappearing. They\\u2019re a huge, single unique copy on a combustible, flammable, deteriorating film base. Fifty years from now, this film would not exist at all.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gault\\u2019s reels were in exceptional condition. After the funding was arranged to have a third-party laboratory digitize the reels, it was up to the Silent Film Festival to restore the footage. That job fell to a senior film restorer, Kathy O\\u2019Regan, who also happened to be a native of Gort, County Galway, a rural area in the west of Ireland not unlike the places Mr. Gault shot in Counties Cork and Kerry.\", \"\\u201cIt was magical to see it,\\u201d Ms. O\\u2019Regan said. \\u201cOn a personal level, the first time I watched it was so exciting. There\\u2019s this one shot of two farmers who are planting potatoes, and I swear to God, one of the men is the absolute spitting image of one of my next-door neighbors. I know it\\u2019s impossible, but it\\u2019s wild just to watch.\\u201d\", \"The 19 reels of film will amount to about 35 minutes of footage once the frame rate is adjusted. After they are graded and restored, Mr. McManus wants to screen the footage in Dingle. He hopes that if more local people see what Mr. Gault shot, they\\u2019ll be able to identify some of the people featured.\", \"For Mr. \\u00d3 Mainn\\u00edn, the film footage offered a chance to see familiar faces in a different light.\", \"\\u201cI know all those people that were in the film, but they were older,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut that\\u2019s when they were young and strong and full of life, you know?\\u201d\", \"As with the birds he studied, Mr. Gault observed the people of rural Ireland in their natural habitats. His reels show people dancing in the streets, baling hay, walking arm in arm.\", \"And, yes, a dog smoking a pipe.\"]","href_hash":"3b78f8ec5a6e11ec9605cf02908885f3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3b78f8ec5a6e11ec9605cf02908885f3"}},
