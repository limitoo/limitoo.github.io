The OSHA rule applies to employers with at least 100 workers, although it exempts those who work at home or exclusively outdoors.\", \"The rule was immediately challenged by employers around the country and several Republican-controlled states. In court papers, they argued that the rule exceeded the agency\\u2019s authority under law to issue regulations to protect workers from toxic hazards at work, arguing the law was meant to address dangerous substances like asbestos but not exposure to the virus.\", \"Earlier this month, a three-judge panel on the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, agreed with the plaintiffs in several of those cases and temporarily blocked the government from proceeding with the rule. But since then, those cases and many others from around the country have been reassigned to the Sixth Circuit in order to consolidate the litigation.\", \"\\u201cThe Fifth Circuit\\u2019s stay should be lifted immediately,\\u201d the Justice Department said in its filing. \\u201cThat court\\u2019s principal rationale was that OSHA allegedly lacked statutory authority to address the grave danger of COVID-19 in the workplace on the ground that COVID-19 is caused by a virus and also exists outside the workplace. That rationale has no basis in the statutory text.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ebe851e04c8211ec8c95a3d4ab45c753"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ebe851e04c8211ec8c95a3d4ab45c753"}},
