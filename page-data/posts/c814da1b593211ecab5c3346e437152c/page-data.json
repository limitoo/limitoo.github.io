James said in the past this investigation focused on whether valuations were inflated when the company was seeking funding and deflated when paying taxes.\", \"\\\"This is another political witch-hunt,\\\" a spokesperson said. \\\"New York is being overrun by violence, children are being shot in Times Square, arsonists are setting Christmas decorations ablaze and homelessness is through the roof, yet the only focus of the New York AG is to investigate Trump, all for her own political ambitions as she attempts to run for Governor. This political persecution is illegal, unethical and is a travesty to our great state and legal system.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948755/us-politic-trump.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Former President Donald Trump''s company faces civil and criminal investigations.

However, on Thursday James announced she was leaving the race.\", \"\\\"I have come to the conclusion that I must continue my work as attorney general. There are a number of important investigations and cases that are underway, and I intend to finish the job. I am running for re-election to complete the work New Yorkers elected me to do,\\\" James said in a statement on Twitter.\", \"In May, James joined a separate criminal fraud investigation into the organization headed by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. This investigation also focuses on valuations, looking into whether the company misled lenders and insurance companies about the value of its properties and whether it paid appropriate taxes.\", \"Since assuming office in 2019, James has focused her sights on the former president, committing herself to this agenda during an appearance on the View where she said, \\\"Trump cannot avoid justice in the great state of New York.\\\" In turn, Trump has called James' efforts unfair, saying that: \\\"She swore that she would 'definitely sue' me.\\\" James has continued on with the investigation despite these allegations.\"]","href_hash":"c814da1b593211ecab5c3346e437152c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c814da1b593211ecab5c3346e437152c"}},
