Terry McAuliffe was the governor of Virginia just four years ago. Joe Biden won the state by 10 points last November,\\\" Carlson said.\", \"\\\"The most famous Democrats on the planet from the sitting President Joe Biden to the former President Barack Obama to Kamala Harris herself have personally campaigned for Terry McAuliffe in the state of Virginia.\", \"\\\"So, the Democratic Party has left nothing on the table, and there's a reason for that. Democrats understand this election is a referendum, not simply on an amoral sleazeball who wants to be the governor again for some reason, but a referendum on the performance of our entire leadership class. A referendum on them.\\\"\", \"Education has been a key election issue for Youngkin during the election campaign, with him vowing to ban the teaching of critical race theory in schools if he is elected in Virginia. Youngkin also attacked McAuliffe for his remarks that parents should not \\\"be telling schools what they should teach\\\" when asked about the issue.\", \"McAuliffe has dismissed claims that critical race theory is currently taught in Virginia and described the fury over it as a \\\"racist dog whistle\\\" which has been blown out of proportion.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Critical Race Theory Debate</div>\", \"The debate around critical race theory looks set to continue until at least the 2022 midterms, with the results in Virginia potentially paving a way for other GOP candidates to make similar vows to Youngkin.\", \"Carlson's claims that McAuliffe dismissing the debate around critical race theory as racist has hurt him appear to be supported by voters in Virginia.\", \"Chris Hillman, the pastor of a small Baptist church in Blackstone, previously told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that he will be backing Youngkin because of his education policies while citing the ongoing tensions in Loudoun County.\", \"For several weeks, parents have been voicing their anger surrounding the proposed teaching of critical race theory in Loudoun County, as well as at the introduction of policies addressing transgender students' rights.\", \"\\\"That'll be the rallying cry. The whole issue with education. That's going to bring people out,\\\" Hillman said. \\\"This has been a Democrat state for so long. It shouldn't be this close.\\\"\", \"Closing his monologue, Carlson added: \\\"Tomorrow, they can send a very clear signal....Stop dividing us by race. Stop indoctrinating our schoolchildren to hate us. Stop treating parents like domestic terrorists.\", \"\\\"This is not about whether a Republican or a Democrat wins tomorrow.
