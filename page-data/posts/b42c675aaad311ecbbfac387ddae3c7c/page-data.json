Indeed, it is difficult to imagine such statements would not lower Mr Mutingwende in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally.\\\"\", \"Mutingwende told the court he received more than 100 abusive messages on Instagram after the post, and it had done huge damage to his reputation in the music and fashion industry and his personal wellbeing.\", \"After claims on social media about sexual offending by a group of Wellington musicians, police launched an investigation called Operation Emerald with reports from about 20 women.\", \"One man was charged in relation to that investigation in December of that year.\", \"The judge said the fact charges had been brought against an associate of Mutingwende did not mean the allegations against him were true.\", \"He awarded costs against Cooper-Taepa.\", \"\\\"I understand Mr Mutingwende is legally aided which will mean that the award will be relatively modest.\\\"\", \"However, Justice Cooke declined to put him under a permanent injunction, saying it was not necessary.\", \"\\\"I have no evidence to suggest that Mr Cooper-Taepa will continue to make these allegations. If he did, of course, there may be further repercussions for him.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"b42c675aaad311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b42c675aaad311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
