If you could go back in time to the 1960s and sit quietly in the corner of a recording studio, watching a band create their next album, which band would you choose?\", \"Well, while you're thinking about it, that in many ways is what filmmaker Peter Jackson has been doing, with the Beatles and the creation of Let it Be.\", \"Several years ago, Jackson was given access to nearly 60 hours of film footage, plus over 120 hours of audio tape, all gathered in January 1969, in the studio, as the Beatles embarked on one of their most daunting projects ever.\", \"As he describes it, it was as if he had been given access to the band members' lives. \\\"Just for one day, just watch them and I'll be really quiet and sit here,\\\" Jackson told the New York Times.\\u00a0\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b2336f9c5037988df5ab66d9a5fb3b66\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Let It Be was released\\u00a0in 1970.</div>\", \"He's being a bit modest because he's the director making The Beatles: Get Back \\u2014\\u00a0the new version of the film about the making of Let it Be. Over three nights from November 25\\u00a0we'll get to watch more than six hours of the Beatles, in glorious restored colour, making what would become their final album. It's a must for anyone who loves music.\\u00a0\", \"Of course, there's already a film called Let it Be, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg. It runs for 90 minutes and creates a not particularly flattering portrait of the band, as they create, argue and self-destruct, heading for their final break-up. It's only ever been available for the public to see in limited form.\", \"Now, with the new version set to air, Peter Jackson and Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr have been talking up the new movie, claiming it really was a lot more fun at the time and the new film will show all that.\\u00a0\", \"You can imagine Lindsay-Hogg might be a bit peed off with the idea, but it seems he's not at all. \\\"That would be great. Because I didn't want to do it again. I did mine,\\\" he told Rolling Stone. \\\"I've seen those 56 hours [of footage] years ago. I love Peter's work. And so I thought, if it's going to go into any hands, he's imaginative, and he's tough, and, I learned, he loves the Beatles.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">A disaster of epic proportions in the making</div>\", \"At this point we should recall the circumstances of the original album's making and the filming that took place, which sets the scene for a disaster of epic proportions.\", \"What the Beatles wanted to do was create an album from start to finish, playing as a band with almost no overdubs. In other words, an honest expression of themselves. But they also wanted to film the process of creation, leading to an album and a concert, that in turn would become a television special.\", \"Making it even more difficult was that they chose to do all this not in an intimate sound studio but a cavernous film set at Twickenham, where people liked to work to union rules between 10am and 4pm each day. All that in the middle of winter.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/295f838cef660b8b08442d0e0b0c629f\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> All the elements of the band's break-up were there in January 1969, along with the good things.(Supplied: Apple Corps Ltd)</div>\", \"The result was a disaster. John Lennon was addicted to heroin and also to Yoko Ono, who went everywhere with him. Tempers frayed. George Harrison left the band and, for a period of time, it seemed like the Beatles as a group was over. Lennon himself called the sessions \\\"hell\\\" and Harrison described them as \\\"the winter of discontent\\\".\\u00a0\", \"If there was any good news, it was that the band reconvened in the Apple studios at Savile Row later in January to finish the job. Importantly, they had keyboardist Billy Preston in tow. Things went much better and judging by the segments you can see of the new film it will focus on those better times in the second half of January 1969.\", \"The problem in all this is that despite the second half of the recording going well, the entire project was put on the shelf for 18 months. At the time there was no thought of releasing it. Of course, Let it Be only saw the light of day after the band broke up and their new business manager Allen Klein demanded the project be finished and released.\\u00a0\", \"The original film was decidedly downbeat. After an initial cinema release it was briefly available on VHS but never DVD, undoubtedly because of its unflinching portrayal of the band.\", \"As Michael Lindsay-Hogg found out, few people wanted to see the Beatles as they truly were, as he explained to Rolling Stone:\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Everyone thinks it's a whitewash'</div>\", \"The question now is this: Is the new film a rewriting of history focusing on the ups, not the downs? This view has been helped by the film's upbeat promos \\u2014\\u00a0as well as Peter Jackson himself: \\\"Everyone sort of thinks it's a whitewash,\\\" he told the Times' Ben Sisario.\\u00a0\", \"But when questioned further about the details of the new film, Jackson has been much more forthcoming, denying the whitewash idea. \\\"Actually it's almost the exact opposite,\\\" he said. \\\"It shows everything Michael Lindsay-Hogg could not show in 1970. It's a very unflinching look at what goes on.\\\"\", \"In many respects that's true. In footage from the new film George Harrison says, \\\"maybe we should have a divorce\\\".\\u00a0\", \"John Lennon is seen pointing at Yoko Ono and telling the other Beatles, \\\"I would sacrifice you all, for her\\\".\", \"To make matters really interesting, during the making of the original movie Harrison leaves the band. As\\u00a0Lindsay-Hogg told Rolling Stone, although he does show the growing sense of conflict, he was pushed into ignoring the walkout, at the urging of the other Beatles. How did it happen?\", \"\\\"It'd be like, someone \\u2014\\u00a0it could be Paul, it could be Ringo and Paul \\u2014 might say, You know when George left? I don't know if we need that in the movie,\\\" Everything's back to normal now, so...\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3e3f357e35ee25725eb73364864b4630\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The Beatles at Paddington Station in London in 1964.(AP: Bob Dear)</div>\", \"But Jackson's version doesn't ignore Harrison's walkout, at least according to him. Using modern digital technology, Jackson has been able to isolate conversations from the audio tapes and reveal what went on when Harrison did go. For example, we might well hear what John Lennon said about Harrison immediately after he left:\", \"Then, on reflection, Lennon changes his approach, pointing to their neglect of Harrison:\", \"Of course, 50 years on it's safe to show Harrison's anger and frustration, as well as the way the other Beatles reacted. So, this time, we might just get the truth.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Did Let It Be\\u00a0doom The Beatles?</div>\", \"The new film also reveals two very distinct dynamics going on throughout the filming and making of the album. Yes, the Beatles did play well together. When they played music, it was as producer George Martin told one of his studio staff: two Beatles you can feel it, when there are four together, it's magic.\", \"But they were now grown men with families, diverse interests and creativity that couldn't be confined to one band.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/fed990e009b60d09037ae2a3643f50f9\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The Beatles at Abbey Road in London in 1969.(Supplied: Linda McCartney)</div>\", \"Lindsay-Hogg who, along with\\u00a0Jackson, is probably part of a select group who've seen all the footage shot in that now notorious January 1969, says he believes both his film and Jackson's show the competing sides of the equation. \\\"Well, it's like talking about any family: both are true,\\\" he told Rolling Stone:\\u00a0\", \"So, did the decision to make Let it Be \\u2014\\u00a0the movie and the album\\u00a0\\u2014 ultimately doom the band?\\u00a0\", \"The answer to this is no. Even after the January '69 debacle there was much more to play out. History shows the group, while arguing over who would manage them, made the glorious Abbey Road and on numerous occasions even\\u00a0Lennon tried to keep the band together.\\u00a0\", \"What The Beatles: Get Back will show is that all the elements of the break-up were certainly there, along with the good things. But as history tell us, sooner or later something had to give. As Peter Jackson has described it, \\\"it shows one singular moment in history that you could possibly say was the beginning of the\\u00a0end\\\".\", \"That's no whitewash.\", \"Enjoy what's coming, revel in it.
