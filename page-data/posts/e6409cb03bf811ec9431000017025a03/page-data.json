That\\u2019s important because that bloc has historically pushed for the toughest targets at international climate talks and was instrumental in clinching the final deal on the Paris Agreement. The United States had dropped from the coalition when Mr. Biden\\u2019s predecessor, Donald J. Trump, withdrew from the Paris accord.\", \"In a statement, the High Ambition Coalition rang the alarm that the world was far off track from the goal of limiting global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, by the end of this century, compared to the start of the industrial age. That\\u2019s the temperature threshold beyond which the most severe climate impacts become significantly more likely.\", \"The group said its countries \\u201cnote with deep concern the gap between existing commitments and a 1.5\\u00b0C pathway, stress the urgent need to accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in this decisive decade, and recognize the importance of ambitious action\\u201d by the 20 nations with the world\\u2019s biggest economies, known as the Group of 20, which are also the world\\u2019s 20 biggest polluters.\", \"At the moment, even if all countries achieve their voluntarily set climate plans, the average global temperature would go far past a 1.5-degree increase, raising the prospect of much more frequent and intense heat waves, fires and floods.\", \"The statement calls on countries to submit more ambitious climate targets in order to collectively reach the target and halt what they called \\u201cinefficient\\u201d fossil fuel subsidies \\u201cas soon as possible,\\u201d and signaled the need to \\u201cincrease resources\\u201d for addressing loss and damage from climate impacts.\", \"Mr. Kerry said he was optimistic that private banks would mobilize far bigger pots of money for countries trying to shift their energy systems away from fossil fuels.\", \"\\u201c$100 billion doesn\\u2019t do it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe only way we \\u2018re going to get it done is if trillions of dollars are forthcoming, and they are.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e6409cb03bf811ec9431000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e6409cb03bf811ec9431000017025a03"}},
