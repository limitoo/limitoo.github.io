But it\\u2019s not a spy novel, per se. In a brief preface, Follett mentions that the idea behind this book emerged from his research for his 2010 novel \\u201cFall of Giants,\\u201d which is set in the early 20th century. \\u201cI was shocked to realize that the First World War was a war that nobody wanted,\\u201d he writes \\u2014 which led him to wonder if and how such a \\u201ctragic accident\\u201d could happen again. \\u201cNever\\u201d provides a very contemporary answer to that question.\", \"The preface removes some of the suspense from what follows, and also makes it clear that the counterterrorism plotline in the novel\\u2019s early pages isn\\u2019t going to be its primary focus. Instead, Follett explores how a conflict between Chad and Sudan slowly draws the United States and China to the brink of conflict. About a quarter of the way into the novel, the scope widens to take in an internal conflict in North Korea, which leads to further fissures between the two superpowers.\", \"\\u201cNever\\u201d isn\\u2019t always a subtle book \\u2014 there\\u2019s a Republican politician who uses the phrase \\u201cbad hombre\\u201d \\u2014 and a subplot about Pauline Green, the U.S. president, watching her marriage implode feels overcrowded. (A greater focus on South Korea\\u2019s president, who makes a few globally significant decisions, would have been welcome.) But as climate change threatens to increase political unrest, Follett neatly dramatizes the growing danger with references to famine in North Korea and lakes drying out in Chad.\", \"Throughout the novel, characters emphasize that nuclear weapons be used only as a last resort. Kai argues with his more militaristic father that \\u201cannihilation would almost certainly follow\\u201d a nuclear strike on the United States, and Green has ominous conversations about atomic war and casualty levels with her advisers and family. And yet, for all of those warnings, the die seems inexorably cast. The book\\u2019s chapters are grouped by Defcon levels; while almost half of the novel takes place in Defcon 5, the \\u201clowest state of readiness,\\u201d it\\u2019s not much of a spoiler to say that this changes for the worse \\u2014 and the tragic momentum of the final hundred pages leads to a sobering conclusion.\", \"DAMASCUS STATIONBy David McCloskey419 pp. Norton. $27.95.\", \"McCloskey, a former C.I.A. analyst, drew on the recent history of Syria for his novel \\u201cDamascus Station\\u201d: Portraits of President Bashar al-Assad hang above office doorways, unrest racks the nation and protests are met with violent crackdowns. At the heart of the book is a game of cat-and-mouse played by three characters \\u2014 Sam Joseph, a C.I.A. agent; Mariam Haddad, who works in the Syrian Palace; and Ali Hassan, a Syrian general. Though perhaps \\u201ccat and cat and mouse\\u201d or \\u201ccat and cat and cat\\u201d might be more apropos, given where the novel ventures.\", \"The shifting dynamics among these characters give this novel much of its tension, with Sam working to recruit Mariam for intelligence work and Ali trying to snuff out security leaks. The decidedly nonregulation relationship that develops between Sam and Mariam complicates matters \\u2014 and, unfortunately, gives free rein to McCloskey\\u2019s more florid tendencies as a writer (\\u201cthe initial cartoon of the sensual, olive-skinned desert princess melting into the English-speaking, Krav Maga-practicing diplomat\\u201d). Sam\\u2019s desire to find justice after one of his colleagues dies in Syrian custody adds another layer of personal investment into the mix.\", \"Where the novel excels is in very specific details of espionage, including an explosive test using cadavers, the C.I.A.\\u2019s continued use of Lotus Notes in the early 2010s (\\u201cWhat is this, 1995?\\u201d one character grouses), and the deployment of a taxidermied cat for dead drops. Sam has a talent for gambling, but thankfully this doesn\\u2019t steer the story toward spy-novel clich\\u00e9s; instead, McCloskey utilizes it to ground Sam\\u2019s sense of risk management.\", \"In the end, it\\u2019s Ali \\u2014 the novel\\u2019s de facto antagonist \\u2014 who emerges as the most intriguing character, portrayed as a man with few good options and no illusions about the regime he works for. \\u201cAssad is going to kill his way out with all of us lashed to his throne,\\u201d he tells his wife at one point \\u2014 and his older brother, Rustum, a sociopath with a penchant for torture, looms ever larger as the novel approaches its conclusion. While Sam and Mariam\\u2019s star-crossed bond is at the center of the novel, characters like Ali and the profane, tattooed station chief, Procter, give it more unpredictability.\", \"THE DAYS TO COMEBy Tom Rosenstiel354 pp. Ecco. $27.99.\", \"A newly elected Democratic president takes office with a plan to eliminate partisan gridlock in Congress, bolster the nation\\u2019s infrastructure and combat climate change. Sound familiar? Rosenstiel\\u2019s \\u201cThe Days to Come\\u201d \\u2014 his latest novel featuring the political fixers Peter Rena and Randi Brooks \\u2014 uses the early days of the presidency of David Traynor, \\u201cthe bro billionaire,\\u201d as the backdrop for a tale of industrial espionage and online disinformation.\", \"The book initially focuses on the efforts of Traynor and his Republican vice president, Wendy Upton (who crossed paths with Rena and Brooks in Rosenstiel\\u2019s previous novel, \\u201cOppo\\u201d), to get their ambitious agenda passed. While the idea of a bipartisan unity ticket might seem overly idealistic, Rosenstiel balances it with a more knowing sense of political \\u201cnihilists\\u201d and the rivals who \\u201chad learned to simply block everything\\u201d that the previous occupant of the Oval Office tried to pass. Meanwhile, Rena deals with an attempt to smear him online that harks back to Pizzagate \\u2014 complete with its own version of the attack on Comet Ping Pong.\", \"Eventually, these seemingly disparate threads come together, though the first third of \\u201cThe Days to Come\\u201d can feel more like a long prologue than a fully engaged aspect of the story. And certain early revelations, such as efforts by Traynor\\u2019s political opponents to shore up their own power, feel undercooked by the end of the book. When Rosenstiel\\u2019s novel finally takes on the idea of international espionage and the advantages and disadvantages of keeping world-changing technology under wraps, it becomes genuinely thought-provoking and lives up to its ambition. Along with its more familiar elements, \\u201cThe Days to Come\\u201d has a few surprises in store \\u2014 even if it has less to say about the current state of Washington than it first seems.\"]","href_hash":"ecd2dbc44c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ecd2dbc44c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}},
