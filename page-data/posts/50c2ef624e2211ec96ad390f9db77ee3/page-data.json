summer, and with our domestic artists, many of those are touring internationally so we haven't got those people touring either,\\\" Ms Richardson said.\", \"\\\"We probably won't see live music come back in a major way until later 2022.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3ad633ee5ef0ce1c0f41c4c04294946c\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div
