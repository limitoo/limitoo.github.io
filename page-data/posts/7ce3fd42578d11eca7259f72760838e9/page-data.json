The treat was featured in the third episode of Netflix's hit series Squid Game, where participants were forced to perfectly carve out a shape on a piece of dalgona without breaking it. Dalgona is pronounced as \\\"tal-goh-NAH.\\\"\", \"Omicron was another word that many seemed to have difficulty pronouncing. The newly identified COVID-19 strain is named after the World Health Organization's Greek variant naming system. The U.S. pronunciation is \\\"AH-muh-kraan,\\\" while the U.K. version is \\\"OH-mee-kraan.\\\"\", \"Some real-life figures were also included on the list. The surname of Eilish (EYE-lish) was shown to be frequently mispronounced, mostly when used to discuss pop singer Billie Eilish. However, the full name of tennis player Stefanos Tsitsipas (STEH-fuh-nohs TSEE-tsee-pas) proved to be a handful with broadcasters everywhere during June's French Open.\", \"Memes and buzzwords hailing from Generation Z also stumped broadcasters, according to the list. The ironic and millennial-skewering cheugy (CHOO-gee) and the comedic editing challenge yassify (YEAH-sih-fai) were included. Cryptocurrencies, such as dogecoin (DOHJ-coin) and ethereum (ih-THEE-ree-umm), also took some getting used to.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947001/dalgona.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A boy holds Dalgona candy at a shop on October 9, 2021, in Seoul, South Korea. Dalgona made it onto this year's list of most mispronounced words as compiled by the U.S. Captioning Company, which captions and subtitles real-time events on TV and in courtrooms.</div>\", \"Companies with difficult names found their way onto the list as well. Fast fashion brand Shein (SHEE-in) and popular restaurant Chipotle (chih-POHT-lay) were often mispronounced. Other words included in the list were Glasgow (GLAHZ-go), the Scottish city where COP26 was held, and Ever Given (EV-er GIV-en), the ship that blocked the Suez Canal.\", \"This report has actually been around longer than many might realize. It began in 2015 and has often reflected the current news topics and trends of their respective times. Touma said that the report helps to illustrate how unfamiliar words can be borrowed from other languages.\", \"However, it also has another purpose, at least for Touma. \\\"As a non-native speaker,\\\" he said, \\\"I must confess it's fun to see English speakers stumbling a bit for a change.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947002/kelce-eilish.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">This combination of 2021 photos shows Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce and pop star Billie Eilish in London.
