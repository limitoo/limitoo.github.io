The offer comes ahead of the Super Bowl, a day in which Domino's typically sells at least 2 million pizzas, he added.\", \"Domino's said in an email that its restaurants are looking to hire more drivers to handle increased delivery orders.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Over the past few years during the pandemic, we saw that many customers began ordering delivery more so than carryout. We figured now, more than ever, is a great time to reward carryout customers who are serving as their own delivery drivers. Although Domino's stores across the U.S. are in need of more drivers, the main reason we launched this campaign was to give back to carryout customers,\\\" a spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.\\u00a0\", \"Delivery drivers at Domino earn an average of just over $42,000 per year, according to\\u00a0ZipRecruiter.\", \"The company's campaign to reduce demand for deliveries comes amid a nationwide shortage of workers, with Americans snubbing low-paying work that can't be done remotely, including childcare and food service.\\u00a0\", \"What's been dubbed the \\\"Great Resignation,\\\"\\u00a0saw a record number quitting their jobs ahead of the holidays, and the ongoing challenge of hiring and retaining employees is particularly acute in the service industry.
