Poor polling numbers for the president don't bode well for the Democrats going into the midterms, as they risk losing both the House and the Senate, which would severely limit Biden's effectiveness in his last two years.\", \"Days into his first term in Congress, Meijer and other freshman GOP members of Congress were facing calls from the leader of their party, Trump, to object to the results of the 2020 election. He and other freshman Republicans reportedly met with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy for advice on how to handle the certification. With Republicans knowing the freshmen's votes were up for grabs, people from both sides tried to convince them to join their ranks, Meijer told The Atlantic.\", \"One longtime member, according to Meijer, told him that he didn't believe the election was stolen but would vote against certifying it anyway. \\\"This is the last thing Donald Trump will ever ask you to do,\\\" Meijer said the member told him.\", \"Meijer criticized his colleagues who objected to the election results, saying they were choosing a bad-faith interpretation of basic law to make their base happy and humor Trump.\"]","href_hash":"05052f86586311ecaf68df7fe0d8de0c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"05052f86586311ecaf68df7fe0d8de0c"}},
