She was 71.\", \"Alyssa Romeo, a great-niece, said the cause was heart failure.\", \"Ms. Saviola frequently drew comparisons to Ethel Merman for her big voice, which she liked to use to comic effect. One character she played in more than one cabaret show received the Ten Commandments of Soul from James Brown, earning her something of a nickname: \\u201cthe Italian Godmother of Soul.\\u201d\", \"Onstage, she was best known for originating the role of Mama Maddelena, a spa manager, in the original production of \\u201cNine,\\u201d the Arthur Kopit-Maury Yeston musical about a film director having a midlife crisis, which opened on Broadway in May 1982 and ran for almost two years.

Though she appeared in only four episodes, from 1993 to 1996, Ms. Saviola was well known to followers of the franchise, many of whom posted about her death on social media.\", \"In a 1995 interview with a \\u201cDeep Space Nine\\u201d fan magazine that is quoted on the website Memory Alpha, Ms. Saviola talked about how she got the part.\", \"\\u201cI went in \\u2014 every character actress was there \\u2014 and did a little reading, the real thing,\\u201d she said, referring not to a script reading but to a tarot card reading. \\u201cMy grandmother read cards and tea leaves down in Greenwich Village \\u2014 she never charged people money \\u2014 and I have a little bit of that gift.\\u201d\", \"Camille Saviola was born on July 16, 1950, in the Bronx to Michael and Mary (D\\u2019Esopo) Saviola.
