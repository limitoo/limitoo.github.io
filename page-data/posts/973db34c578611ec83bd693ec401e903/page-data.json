The nation's net favorability among South Koreans was minus 79 percentage points, and among the Japanese it was minus 74 percentage points.\", \"Jason McMann, Morning Consult's head of geopolitical risk analysis, said in a statement there's \\\"increasing concern\\\" about China as both an economic power and nondemocratic military power.\", \"The polls' findings come as U.S.-China tensions mount with the Biden administration's decision to implement a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.
