The fantasy comedy film about the famous doll, directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is set to open in the Southeast Asian nation on July 19.\", \" After reviewing the film twice and consulting foreign affairs officials and legal experts, the government's Movie and Television Review and Classification Board said it would allow it to be screened.\", \"The censors began examining \\\"Barbie\\\" last week after Vietnam reportedly banned the film over scenes featuring a map showing the so-called nine-dash line, which China uses to justify its maritime claims. Beijing claims almost the entire South China Sea, despite rival claims from other Southeast Asian countries including the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam.\", \"In April, China accused the U.S. of \\\"endangering regional peace\\\" by signing a new deal with the Philippines that will see four additional bases in the country used by U.S. troops, including one near the disputed South China Sea and another not far from Taiwan.\", \"Long-time treaty allies Manila and Washington\\u00a0agreed in February\\u00a0to expand cooperation in \\\"strategic areas\\\" of the Philippines as they seek to counter Beijing's growing assertiveness over self-governed Taiwan and China's\\u00a0construction of bases in the South China Sea.\", \"After \\\"meticulous\\\" scrutiny of the film, Philippine censors were convinced that the \\\"cartoonish map\\\" did not depict the nine-dash line.\", \"\\\"Instead, the map portrayed the route of the make-believe journey of Barbie from Barbie Land to the 'real world,' as an integral part of the story,\\\" the censorship board said in a statement.\", \"\\\"Rest assured that the Board has exhausted all possible resources in arriving at this decision as we have not hesitated in the past to sanction filmmakers/ producers/ distributors for exhibiting the fictitious 'nine-dash line' in their materials.\\\"\", \" In a separate letter to Philippine Senator Francis Tolentino, who had criticized the film for \\\"violating Filipino fisherfolks' rights,\\\" the censors said they had asked Hollywood studio Warner Bros to \\\"blur\\\" the controversial lines on the map.\", \" Dashed lines drawn in a \\\"child-like manner\\\" appeared in several locations on the map around land masses identified as Europe, North America, South America, Africa and Asia, the censors said.
