He was 105.\", \"Mr. Lee\\u2019s daughter, Eve, confirmed the death.\", \"Already a concertmaster leading white theater orchestras by 1943, Mr. Lee made a significant breakthrough on Broadway when he was appointed music director of Leonard Bernstein\\u2019s \\u201cOn the Town\\u201d in September 1945. The Chicago Defender called him the first Black conductor \\u201cto wave the baton over a white orchestra in a Broadway production.\\u201d\", \"In 1953, Mr. Lee conducted the Louisville Orchestra in Kentucky, a nerve-shredding afternoon for him because of little rehearsal time and the pressure of history. United Press reported that Mr. Lee\\u2019s concert was \\u201cone of the first\\u201d at which a Black man led a white orchestra in the South; other outlets went further, claiming that it was the very first such time. The Courier-Journal critic said that he \\u201cmade a most favorable first impression.\\u201d\", \"Then, in 1955, shortly after Marian Anderson had made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, Mr. Lee conducted the New York City Opera, another first. (His wife, Sylvia Olden Lee, a vocal coach, had been appointed the first Black musician on the Met\\u2019s staff around that time.)\", \"\\u201cNot only was his conducting expert in all its technical aspects,\\u201d a New York Times critic wrote of his \\u201cLa Traviata,\\u201d \\u201cbut it was informed with musicianship and an exceptionally keen grasp of the character of the opera.\\u201d\", \"Despite the breakthroughs, racism constrained Mr. Lee\\u2019s U.S. career, though he refused to let it define his work. \\u201cA Negro, standing in front of a white symphony group?\\u201d the artist manager Arthur Judson asked him, according to Ms. Lee, in the late 1940s, declining to sign him up. \\u201cNo. I\\u2019m sorry.\\u201d\", \"Judson suggested that Mr. Lee follow other Black musicians into exile abroad. Mr. Lee didn\\u2019t leave at first, but eventually did so in 1957 and prospered in Germany, Colombia and especially Sweden, where he succeeded Herbert Blomstedt as music director of the Norrkoping Symphony Orchestra, from 1962 to 1972.\", \"Mr. Lee frequently said that he longed to return to the United States but would only do so to become the music director of a major orchestra.\", \"\\u201cI did not have very much hope at home, despite some success,\\u201d he told The Atlanta Constitution in 1970, saying that racism was less of a factor in his life and work in Europe. \\u201cIt would be nice to work at home. I\\u2019m an American \\u2014 why not?\\u201d If he could make it in Europe, he concluded, \\u201cI should be able to make it here.\\u201d\", \"Only one top ensemble, the Oregon Symphony, has ever given such a post to a Black conductor: James DePreist.\", \"Everett Astor Lee was born on Aug. 31, 1916, in Wheeling, W. Va., the first son of Everett Denver Lee, a barber, and Mamie Amanda (Blue) Lee, a homemaker. He started the violin at age 8, and his talent prompted the family to move to Cleveland in 1927.\", \"Mr. Lee ran track in junior high, a few years behind the Olympian gold medalist Jesse Owens, and led the Glenville High School orchestra as concertmaster. He came under the mentorship of the Cleveland Orchestra\\u2019s conductor, Artur Rodzinski, after a chance meeting at the hotel where Mr. Lee worked as an elevator operator. He studied at the Cleveland Institute of Music with the Cleveland Orchestra\\u2019s concertmaster, Joseph Fuchs.\", \"Graduating in 1941, Mr. Lee enlisted in the Army and trained to become a Tuskegee airman in Alabama, but he injured himself and was released.\", \"Mr. Lee moved to New York in 1943 to play in the orchestra for \\u201cCarmen Jones,\\u201d an Oscar Hammerstein II rewrite of Georges Bizet\\u2019s \\u201cCarmen\\u201d that had an all-Black cast but a primarily white orchestra. When the conductor was snowed in, early in 1944, Mr. Lee stepped from the concertmaster\\u2019s chair to conduct Bizet\\u2019s music. Spells conducting George Gershwin\\u2019s \\u201cPorgy and Bess\\u201d followed, before Bernstein hired him as concertmaster and later music director of \\u201cOn the Town.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIn an era of Jim Crow segregation in performance,\\u201d the musicologist Carol J. Oja has written, \\u201cLee\\u2019s appointment was downright remarkable.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Lee then played in the violin section of the New York City Symphony for Bernstein, who arranged a scholarship to Tanglewood in 1946, where Mr. Lee studied conducting with Serge Koussevitzky of the Boston Symphony; he conducted the Boston Pops in 1949.\", \"\\u201cLike most young people,\\u201d Mr. Lee told New York Amsterdam News in 1977, \\u201cI thought I could go out and conquer the world.\\u201d\", \"But there was a color line Mr. Lee could not cross. Rodzinski, now conductor of the New York Philharmonic, refused to let him audition for its violin section, knowing the inevitable result. Hammerstein considered him for a touring production but told him that \\u201cif a colored boy is the conductor, and we go into the South,\\u201d it would cause an uproar and cause bookings to be canceled.\", \"Mr. Lee responded by creating the Cosmopolitan Little Symphony in 1947, an integrated ensemble that rehearsed at Harlem\\u2019s Grace Congregational Church. It made its downtown debut with him on the podium at Town Hall in May 1948, with a bill that included the premiere of \\u201cBrief Elegy\\u201d by Ulysses Kay, one of many Black composers Mr. Lee programmed during his career.\", \"By 1952, the Cosmopolitan was giving a concert performance of Giuseppe Verdi\\u2019s \\u201cLa Forza del Destino\\u201d before 2,100 people at City College, with the Met\\u2019s Regina Resnik as Leonora.\", \"\\u201cMy own group is coming along fairly well,\\u201d Mr. Lee wrote Bernstein, suggesting \\u201cit may be the beginning of breaking down a lot of foolish barriers.\\u201d But starting any ensemble was hard then, let alone an integrated one. Recruitment had been difficult because trained Black musicians now believed \\u201cthat there was \\u2018no future\\u2019 in achieving high standards of proficiency,\\u201d Mr. Lee wrote in The Times in December 1948.\", \"Despite signing with the New York City Opera staff in 1955, Mr. Lee left for Europe. He moved to Munich in 1957, founding an orchestra at the Amerika Haus and leading a traveling opera company. Guest spots came quickly; he led the Berlin Philharmonic in June 1960, one of many European dates.\", \"Like Dean Dixon, a Black conductor who led the Gothenburg Symphony from 1953 to 1960, Mr. Lee found sanctuary in Sweden. He maintained an ambitious repertoire in Norrkoping, performing operas from \\u201cAida\\u201d to \\u201cPorgy,\\u201d conducting vast quantities of Swedish music, with Hans Eklund\\u2019s \\u201cMusic for Orchestra\\u201d a favorite, and often collaborating with jazz players led by the saxophonist Arne Domnerus. It was a balance of new and old, local and otherwise, that Mr. Lee repeated as chief conductor of the Bogot\\u00e1 Philharmonic from 1985 to 1987.\", \"Even so, Mr. Lee never quite gave up on U.S. orchestras. He started to make guest appearances again. \\u201cThe inescapable conclusion is, he should be around more often,\\u201d a Times critic wrote in 1966. In 1973, he took command of the Symphony of the New World, a New York ensemble that had been founded in 1965 as an integrated orchestra, like his now defunct Cosmopolitan. After an association with the Philadelphia-based Opera Ebony, he took a last bow, with the Louisville Orchestra, in 2005.\", \"Although Black conductors such as Mr. DePreist, Paul Freeman and Henry Lewis had become more prominent by the 1970s, Mr. Lee saw little real improvement.\", \"\\u201cThere has been no major change in my field,\\u201d he told The Afro-American Newspaper in 1972. \\u201cOrchestra companies feel if they had a Black orchestra leader last year, they don\\u2019t need one this year.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Lee fulfilled a dream of conducting the New York Philharmonic on the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1976, leading Sergei Rachmaninoff, Jean Sibelius and David Baker\\u2019s \\u201cKosbro\\u201d \\u2014 short for \\u201cKeep on Steppin\\u2019 Brothers.\\u201d \", \"Mr. Lee\\u2019s marriage to Ms. Lee ended in divorce. He married Christin Andersson in 1979. She survives him, as does Eve Lee, his daughter from his first marriage; a son from his second, Erik Lee; two granddaughters; and one great-granddaughter.\", \"Despite the barriers that Mr. Lee faced, he said in an interview published in 1997 that he was not \\u201cbitter.\\u201d\", \"He recalled being denied violin auditions at two major U.S. orchestras.\", \"\\u201cI then made up my mind that if I can\\u2019t join you, then I will lead you. I did make good on that promise to myself. Those two orchestras that denied me even an audition, I have conducted,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI just had to. I just had to show them that I was there.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"39687b837a2511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"39687b837a2511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
