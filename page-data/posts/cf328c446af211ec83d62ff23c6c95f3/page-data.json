But the arrival of vaccines and the drop in infection rate (remember that?) did mean that we were again regularly traveling throughout the country.\", \"Here are some highlights from our recent experiences.\", \"British Columbia couldn\\u2019t catch a break in 2021. There was a record heat wave that led to hundreds of deaths and wildly out of control forest fires that destroyed the town of Lytton. Flooding this fall killed four people and caused damage to buildings, highways, utility lines and railways. The rainfall was devastating, killing 628,000 chickens, 420 dairy cows, 12,000 hogs and submerging 110 beehives.\", \"Other news from British Columbia shook the nation. The Tk\\u2019emlups First Nation announced a preliminary finding that ground-penetrating radar had located the remains of 215 people, most of them very likely children, in unmarked graves on the grounds of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School.\", \"More grim findings soon followed from other First Nations communities.\", \"The discoveries were confirmation of former students\\u2019 stories that many of their classmates died while being forced to attend the schools: from malnutrition, disease spread through overcrowding, fires, neglect and abuse from clergy who ran the schools.\", \"In my many years reporting on the residential school system \\u2014 established to eradicate Indigenous identity and cultures \\u2014 I hadn\\u2019t seen the same level of intense public reaction that these recent events evoked. The unmarked graves seemed to have made real the horrors of residential schools for many Canadians and people around the world.\", \"It was while reporting on the issue in Kamloops, British Columbia, that I had a meeting I won\\u2019t soon forget. Garry Gottfriedson is a residential school survivor, educator, a former rancher and a poet who studied under Allen Ginsberg.\", \"Mr. Gottfriedson invited the photographer Amber Bracken and me to travel with him up into the mountains outside of Kamloops where his grandmother spent her summers. We were joined by some of his extended family members and planned to hunt for a medicinal root.\", \"The harvest didn\\u2019t work out. Mr. Gottfriedson learned from a cousin that the plant had matured beyond its harvest point earlier in the year. But we did have an extraordinary day. We sat under a tree, its pine scent filling the air, for a long conversation about residential schools, his activist rancher parents who also traveled the rodeo circuit, poetry and life in general.\", \"Much of our conversation made it may into an article. The Times\\u2019s podcast \\u201cThe Daily\\u201d used it to tell the story of residential schools.\", \"[Listen: The Daily, \\u201cState-Sponsored Abuse in Canada\\u201d]\", \"[Read: With Discovery of Unmarked Graves, Canada\\u2019s Indigenous Seek Reckoning]\", \"In a year of much bad news, meeting Mr. Gottfriedson, among many other Indigenous people, brought me hope. He and others are living proof that the residential school system ultimately failed in its objective of destroying their cultures.\", \"\\u2014 Ian Austen\", \"In a pandemic year, made worse by the agony of periodically being stuck at home, the stories that stand out are the ones that allow me to explore new landscapes. Among the most memorable was a faux Florida retirement community in Quebec, with 30-foot fake plastic palm trees covered with snow.\", \"I went there during a chilly March. Because the pandemic had spoiled their annual pilgrimages to Miami, the 520 residents of Domaine de la Florida had re-created a make-believe tropical refuge in Quebec, trading in their bathing suits for thermal underwear and living in identical boxy houses on streets with names like Cocoa Avenue.\", \"[Read: Canadian Snowbirds Find Refuge In Their Mythical Miami]\", \"The complex had a pool (closed off because of freezing temperatures) and golf carts to whisk residents to summertime shuffleboard games. Locals even decorated their gardens with pink flamingos, and held outdoor barbecues in winter.\", \"The effect was both surreal, a tad kitsch and entirely endearing, impressing upon me the adaptability of human beings during a pandemic.\", \"\\u201cAt least we had a white Christmas this year and can pretend we\\u2019re in Miami,\\u201d G\\u00e9rard Ste-Croix, a 71-year-old resident, told me while cradling his shivering Yorkshire terrier, Mala.\", \"My year was also defined by a series of heartbreaking stories. The one that stood out the most was a reporting trip to Manawan, an Indigenous reservation, to report on the death of Joyce Echaquan, an Indigenous mother of seven, who passed away in a Quebec hospital amid a torrent of racist taunts, which she had captured on video.\", \"[Read: After Video of Abusive Nurse, Canada\\u2019s Indigenous Seek Health Overhaul]\", \"The trip to the reserve over a 50-mile unpaved dirt road was harrowing, and made me wonder how ambulances endured it. Indigenous leaders on the reserve told me that road accidents were frequent.\", \"The trip underlined the health care challenges faced by Canada\\u2019s 1.7 million Indigenous citizens, including prejudices that were shortening life spans. On the reserve, families of as many of 20 people were living in four-room houses, making self-isolation challenging during a pandemic.\", \"I was awed by the resilience of Ms. Echaquan\\u2019s husband, Carol Dub\\u00e9, who told me about the pain he had endured since her death, including having to tell his young children that they no longer had a mother.\", \"\\u2014 Dan Bilefsky\", \"\", \"This week\\u2019s Trans Canada section was compiled by Vjosa Isai, Canada news assistant.\", \"A native of Windsor, Ontario, Ian Austen was educated in Toronto, lives in Ottawa and has reported about Canada for The New York Times for the past 16 years.
