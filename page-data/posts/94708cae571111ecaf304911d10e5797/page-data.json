The couple have pleaded not guilty. They are each being held on a $500,000 bond.\", \"Over the weekend, Sheriff Michael Bouchard and Detroit Police Chief James White said that Sikora could be charged if investigators conclude that he sought to help the couple evade police capture, FOX 2 Detroit reported.\", \"Police have not charged Sikora. His lawyer said he \\\"voluntarily contacted\\\" authorities to provide more information about the couple and their stay at his place after hearing about their arrest.\", \"\\\"Andrzej Sikora is very concerned that he's even roped into this, but I do believe when all the evidence has panned out and all the facts are sorted through, there's not going to be evidence that he knowingly aided and abetted or harbored a fugitive. In fact, he was not in the loop,\\\" Dass said, according to local station WJBK-TV.\", \"\\\"The minute he did find that out, he went without an attorney to the Detroit Police Department and told them everything,\\\" Dass said.\", \"The Crumbleys' attorney said that the couple had intended on turning themselves in to authorities. He also said that they had left town, not to evade police capture, but because they had received threats after their son was named as a suspect in the deadly school shooting. The shooting also injured seven students.\", \"The parents were called into their son's school on the day of the shooting and alerted about a drawing he had allegedly made, which showed a gun and bloody figure. Police say that Crumbley's parents purchased him the gun used in the school shooting, but they didn't inquire about its whereabouts when it went missing.\", \"Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said the parents, as gun owners, had a \\\"duty to make sure that you don't give access to this deadly weapon to somebody that you have reason to believe is going to harm someone.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"94708cae571111ecaf304911d10e5797"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"94708cae571111ecaf304911d10e5797"}},
