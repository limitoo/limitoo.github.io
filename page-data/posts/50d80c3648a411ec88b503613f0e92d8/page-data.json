As he does this, the shark lifts its fin and hits the crewmember.\", \"Startled, the crewmember looks back at the shark while the rest of the crew laughs.\", \"Thordarson's video was met with mixed reactions. While some commenters were merely stunned by the shark's size, others who were worried about the shark's safety and overall wellbeing criticized the crew.\", \"\\\"I love that we're standing around laughing at an animal that was caught ... and is more than likely going to die due to the change in pressure,\\\" said TikTok user k3nn3dy_s.\", \"Snuzyqz commented: \\\"it can't breathe.\\\"\", \"Rochelle added that the video, \\\"makes [her] sad.\\\"\", \"In defense of the crew, one commenter quipped: \\\"So many people commenting about how sad this is while they head to their local sushi bar for a $14 specialty roll.\\\"\", \"TikTok user Karly CA wanted to know: \\\"Why did you bring it on the boat?\\\"\", \"In response, Thordarson said: \\\"We can't control what comes in the trawler.\\\"\", \"A trawler is \\\"a conical net that snares fish by being dragged through the water or along the bottom,\\\" said Britannica.\", \"\\\"Floats are attached to the headrope, top of trawl opening, while weights and special gear are attached to the footrope, bottom of trawl opening, to keep the net open as it moves through the water across the ocean floor,\\\" explained NOAA Fisheries.\", \"\\\"The mesh is designed to confine fish inside the net, trapping them...as the trawl is hauled to the surface,\\\" NOAA Fisheries continued.\", \"Target species of bottom trawling include shrimp, crabs and flounder, among others.
