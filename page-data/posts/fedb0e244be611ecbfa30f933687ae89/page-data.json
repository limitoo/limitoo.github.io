He was 83.\", \"The cause was heart failure, his wife, Iris Klein, said.\", \"By background a Parisian Jew and by trade a tenured academic in the Columbia University French department with a specialty in abstruse philosophy, Professor Lotringer somehow charmed his way into a classically American career consisting of successive 15-minute bursts of fame.\", \"He emerged in public life in the late 1970s as a kind of P.T. Barnum for postmodernism. Two conferences he held in New York \\u2014 \\u201cSchizo-Culture\\u201d in 1975 and \\u201cNova Convention\\u201d in 1978 \\u2014 crystallized an emerging avant-garde composed of aging Beats, experimental musicians, performance artists, punks and a new generation of philosophers.\", \"At \\u201cSchizo-Culture,\\u201d the philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault \\u2014 one of whose lectures focused on the history of masturbation \\u2014 were drawn into ideological sparring matches with hecklers in the crowd. At \\u201cNova,\\u201d Philip Glass, Patti Smith and Frank Zappa paid tribute to the Beat writer William S. Burroughs. A 19-year-old Thurston Moore, years away from forming the band Sonic Youth, also attended, but only as a humble devotee of the assembled luminaries.\", \"Around the same time, Professor Lotringer and a group of graduate students founded a magazine that he gave the cryptic name Semiotext(e). Its pages became a gathering place for his eclectic clique. Figures like Burroughs and Foucault appeared alongside up-and-comers like the writer Kathy Acker. An issue in honor of the \\u201cSchizo-Culture\\u201d conference sold out its print run of 3,000 issues in three weeks.\", \"Professor Lotringer responded to this popularity by losing interest in his magazine, which stopped coming out in 1987, and ceasing to throw his signature events. (One exception: a 1996 conference at a Nevada casino that featured the French philosopher Jean Baudrillard lecturing in a gold lam\\u00e9 suit.)\", \"\\u201cNever give people what they want, or they\\u2019ll hate you for it,\\u201d Professor Lotringer said in an interview with The Brooklyn Rail in 2006.\", \"Instead, he steered Semiotext(e) into publishing thin books of esoteric critical theory sans introductory or explanatory text. \\u201cTheir place was in the pockets of spiked leather jackets as much as on the shelves,\\u201d he recalled in Artforum magazine in 2003.\", \"He made an impact with Semiotext(e)\\u2019s first book, \\u201cSimulations\\u201d (1983), by Mr. Baudrillard, who soon became \\u201cthe art world\\u2019s po-mo poster boy,\\u201d the editor and critic Rhonda Lieberman wrote in Artforum in 2005. The first \\u201cMatrix\\u201d movie, released in 1999, lifted material from the work of Mr. Baudrillard that Professor Lotringer had published, including dialogue \\u2014 like the phrase \\u201cdesert of the real\\u201d \\u2014 and the concept of virtual reality overtaking real life.\", \"Semiotext(e) kept publishing books and discovering improbable mainstream hits. In 2009 and again in 2010, the Fox News personality Glenn Beck used a Semiotext(e) book, \\u201cThe Coming Insurrection,\\u201d to argue that \\u201cpeople on the extreme left are calling people to arms\\u201d and to warn, \\u201cWe are doomed.\\u201d His tirades pushed the book to No. 1 on Amazon\\u2019s best-seller list, The New York Times reported.\", \"\\u201cI would be willing to come on the show if he had read the book, but he has never read it,\\u201d Professor Lotringer told The Times.\", \"Semiotext(e) evolved over time with the help of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whose publishing house distributes its books, and with the addition of two co-editors, who introduced new themes and authors. Yet the degree to which Semiotext(e) remains associated with its founder may be gleaned from the fact that the book it is best known for publishing features Professor Lotringer himself as a character.\", \"That book is \\u201cI Love Dick,\\u201d a novel by Chris Kraus, one of the Semiotext(e) co-editors and Professor Lotringer\\u2019s ex-wife. Its plot includes a character named Sylv\\u00e8re Lotringer, who becomes entangled in his wife\\u2019s attraction to a colleague named Dick. (The wife in the book is named Chris Kraus.)\", \"The novel did not attract much attention upon its publication in 1997, but critical praise gradually built; more than 50,000 copies were sold in 2016 alone. The next year, Amazon adapted the book into a TV series of the same title, with Griffin Dunne as Professor Lotringer, Kevin Bacon as Dick and Kathryn Hahn as Kraus.\", \"The real-life Ms. Kraus depicted Professor Lotringer as brilliant but also sweetly self-effacing. \\u201cBeneath his reputation at the Mudd Club\\u201d \\u2014 a well-known punk-rock dive \\u2014 \\u201cas the philosopher of kinky sex, Sylv\\u00e8re was a closet humanist,\\u201d Ms. Kraus wrote. \\u201cGuilt and duty more than S&M propelled his life.\\u201d\", \"The writer Lucy Sante, who has explored 1970s and \\u201980s New York, among other topics, and who attended \\u201cSchizo-Culture\\u201d and studied with Professor Lotringer, recalled both his charisma and his remoteness.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019d go to a movie, we\\u2019d go to a party, we\\u2019d go to a club \\u2014 there was Sylv\\u00e8re, inevitably,\\u201d she said in a phone interview. \\u201cHe\\u2019s the man of mystery. He\\u2019s everybody\\u2019s buddy, but nobody gets to know him too well.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Kraus proposed a theory connecting Professor Lotringer\\u2019s editorial work to his sensibility.\", \"\\u201cYou could say everything he achieved with Semiotext(e) was the result of displacement,\\u201d she said. \\u201cEvery time he did a book-length interview with a philosopher, it was a means of avoiding writing about his own experience in the war.\\u201d\", \"Sylv\\u00e8re Lotringer was born on Oct. 15, 1938, in Paris \\u2014 less than two years before the city fell to Nazi Germany. His father, Cudek, and his mother, Doba (Borenstein) Lotringer, were Jewish immigrants from Poland who ran a fur shop.\", \"Sylv\\u00e8re and his older sister, Yvonne, were the only two Jews at their school. The headmistress had contacts in the French Resistance, and she gave the young Lotringers false papers so that they could impersonate two of their fellow students, Serge and Huguette Bonnat.\", \"The family fled to the countryside, where a woman from whom they had rented a place for holidays took in the children. Sylv\\u00e8re\\u2019s mother instructed him to repeat, again and again, \\u201cMy name is Serge Bonnat,\\u201d adding, \\u201cThey kill little children who tell their real names.\\u201d After he nearly revealed his name during a trip to buy milk, he was forbidden to leave the house.\", \"Following the liberation of Paris, Sylv\\u00e8re endured beatings at school and found a sense of belonging only with a Zionist youth group. He prepared to move to Israel and establish a kibbutz with his friends but then started questioning himself when he failed his final high school philosophy exam.\", \"He described this period in a memoir, \\u201cThe Man Who Slips,\\u201d which he threw himself into writing toward the end of his life. (It remains unpublished. Professor Lotringer\\u2019s wife, Ms. Klein, provided a draft.)\", \"\\u201cWe only had the future in mind, and believed it was close at hand,\\u201d Professor Lotringer wrote. \\u201cNo questions asked, only one answer. No wonder I failed my exam.\\u201d\", \"On behalf of himself and his friends, he sent a letter to their mentors resigning from the Zionist movement.\", \"He went on to show promise in Paris intellectual circles \\u2014 establishing a Marxist cultural magazine with the writer Georges Perec, contributing to another magazine edited by the poet Louis Aragon, and studying under Roland Barthes. He developed an interest in Virginia Woolf and traveled across Britain in a Vespa interviewing figures connected to her, like Leonard Woolf and Vita Sackville-West.\", \"Professor Lotringer earned a Ph.D. in the sociology of literature from the \\u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \\u00c9tudes in 1967 and ambled among appointments at universities in Turkey, Australia and the United States.\", \"In addition to Ms. Klein, with whom he had homes in Mexico and Los Angeles, he is survived by a daughter, Mia Lotringer Marano, from a relationship with Susie Flato, a former colleague at Columbia and Semiotext(e), and two grandsons. Two prior marriages ended in divorce. His sister died in 2010.\", \"In a 2016 Semiotext(e) monograph titled \\u201c\\u00c9tant Donn\\u00e9s,\\u201d Professor Lotringer recounted how whenever he returned to Paris he would search for Serge Bonnat, the boy he had impersonated during the war. He called every entry for the name in the Paris phone book, then entries for other people with the same surname.\", \"Finally, in 2016, he got Mr. Bonnat on the phone.\", \"\\u201cI am a Juste!\\u201d he declared, using a French term for gentiles who helped Jews during the war. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll celebrate this with a bottle of Champagne.\\u201d\", \"The two men spent an afternoon together. But reflecting on the experience prompted in him a haunting thought: Just 0.5 percent of French society, he found, qualified as a \\u201cJuste.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhat were the Injustes doing in France during that time, the 99.5 percent of the population one never mentions?\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cAnd what are they doing today?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"fedb0e244be611ecbfa30f933687ae89"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fedb0e244be611ecbfa30f933687ae89"}},
