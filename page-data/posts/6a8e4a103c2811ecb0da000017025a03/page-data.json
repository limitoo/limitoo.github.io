The global agency, which replaces the social network\\u2019s previous media partners, Dentsu and Mindshare, also recently won business from the beauty retailer Clarins and the automaker Toyota. The decision does not affect Meta\\u2019s creative strategy.\", \"Meta made the change after a seven-month review, during which it came under intense public scrutiny from damaging revelations about its business practices and its apps\\u2019 effects on teenagers, fueled by the whistle-blower Frances Haugen, a former employee.\", \"Even as the social platform grappled with the scandals, major ad companies presented pitches for what would be an especially high-profile client. Meta shelled out nearly $3.6 billion on marketing and sales in the most recent quarter, 32 percent more than a year earlier. Winning the Meta account offered agencies access to the social media behemoth\\u2019s deep pockets and sizable influence.\", \"The situation underscores Madison Avenue\\u2019s codependence on Meta. Most of the advertising industry is either already in business with the company or hopes to be, usually by placing ads on its platforms or placing ads for Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger on other platforms.\", \"Last month, Meta said it earned 97 percent of its revenue, or $28.3 billion, by selling ad space in the most recent quarter. Advertising Week, a recent industry conference, featured panels presented by Meta, which has also sponsored events for the Association of National Advertisers and the American Association of Advertising Agencies. Meta employees sit on the boards of industry trade groups such as the Interactive Advertising Bureau and the American Advertising Federation.\", \"The ad industry spawned Facebook and is \\u201cthe hidden hand behind all the appalling Facebook headlines,\\u201d but has remained largely circumspect about the company, wrote Bob Hoffman, a veteran of the business, in his Ad Contrarian newsletter last month. \\u201cWhile the rest of the world is nauseated by Facebook\\u2019s activities, the industry that has the deepest connection to it, and has the most to lose, is ours. And yet \\u2026 crickets.\\u201d\", \"Bob Liodice, the chief executive of the ANA, said in an email that the group took brand safety concerns seriously but that its members \\u201care responsible for making their own investment choices to determine the suitability of a specific platform or media vehicle for their brand building.\\u201d\", \"The IAB did not respond to a request for comment. The American Association of Advertising Agencies said it would continue to address issues related to ensuring a safe and transparent ecosystem.\", \"But one company, the outdoor apparel and equipment seller Patagonia, said it had stopped all paid advertising on Meta\\u2019s platforms last year because of brand safety issues.\", \"\\u201cThe internal Facebook documents released over the last few weeks have made it incredibly clear that they know the irreparable damage that their lack of accountability causes their three billion users and the corrosive effects that has on society itself,\\u201d Ryan Gellert, Patagonia\\u2019s chief executive, said in an emailed statement. \", \"Meta, like many other companies, works with both creative agencies, which help design and produce marketing campaigns, and with media agencies, which help determine where the ads go. It has relationships with almost all of the modern ad industry, which is made up mostly of six large holding companies \\u2014 Dentsu, Havas, IPG, Omnicom, Publicis and WPP \\u2014 which control a constellation of subsidiary agencies. Meta also works with consulting companies like Accenture, which have bought up agencies in recent years, and some independent shops.\", \"On the creative side, Droga5, owned by Accenture, helps Meta craft corporate messaging and created videos for the company timed to the Olympics. BBDO, owned by Omnicom, does marketing campaigns for WhatsApp and the main Facebook app. Johannes Leonardo, which is partially owned by WPP, took over Instagram work from Ogilvy this spring. Meta also has an internal team, known as Creative X, working on marketing.\", \"Wieden+Kennedy, an independent agency based in Portland, was responsible for the overall Facebook brand and created the company\\u2019s commercial for the 2020 Super Bowl. But during a large-scale boycott of the social network last year by advertisers upset with the platform\\u2019s policy around hate speech, Colleen DeCourcy, Wieden+Kennedy\\u2019s chief creative officer, said the situation \\u201ccreated a lot of hard conversations inside the agency.\\u201d\", \"Asked in Time magazine whether she expected Facebook to be a client in 2021, she said: \\u201cIf I was a betting person? I wouldn\\u2019t put too many of my dollars on that space.\\u201d\", \"A Wieden+Kennedy spokeswoman said the agency was no longer working with Meta and that they parted ways in the first half of the year.\", \"Since it started spending in earnest on marketing in 2014, Facebook had entrusted its media budget to Dentsu and Mindshare, an agency owned by WPP. It began its media review in April, working with the management consulting firm ID Comms, a matchmaker of sorts that also oversaw reviews this year for Hershey\\u2019s and T-Mobile.\", \"Meta required participating agencies to agree to restrictive contract terms before allowing them to move forward to various budget planning and buying exercises, said two people with knowledge of the negotiations who were not authorized to speak publicly. Meta declined to comment on the process.\", \"As Meta\\u2019s troubles mounted, employees at some of the agencies protested the idea having the company as a client, the people said.\", \"In July, Mindshare removed itself from the social network\\u2019s media review, which was conducted virtually. Meta took Havas, another ad giant, out of the running last month. Publicis\\u2019 Spark Foundry won the pitch over its final rival, Dentsu.\", \"\\u201cWe have a long legacy of leading brands through transformation and look forward to working with Meta on the next evolution of their business,\\u201d said Sarah Kramer, the chief executive of Spark Foundry US, in a statement.\", \"Mindshare, Dentsu and Havas did not immediately have a comment. GroupM, which runs Mindshare, declined to comment.\", \"Meta has also grappled with complaints about mistreating the ad industry. Ms. Haugen, the whistle-blower, testified that the company had misled advertisers about its efforts to fortify its platform against harmful content and has tried to block efforts to excavate data about political ads. \", \"The true test of Madison Avenue\\u2019s patience with Meta will depend on the company\\u2019s popularity with users, said Blake Droesch, an analyst with eMarketer, on a recent podcast from the research firm.\", \"\\u201cUsers leaving Facebook is the only thing that would make advertisers leave Facebook,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"6a8e4a103c2811ecb0da000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6a8e4a103c2811ecb0da000017025a03"}},
