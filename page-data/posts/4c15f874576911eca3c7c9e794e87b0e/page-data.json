toughest economic sanctions yet if the Kremlin\\u00a0decides to invade\\u00a0Ukraine, according to US\\u00a0officials.\", \"The officials\\u00a0said the sanctions were designed to dissuade Vladimir Putin from using tens of thousands of troops massed near the Ukrainian border to attack Russia's\\u00a0southern neighbour.\", \"One source said the sanctions could target Russia's biggest banks and Moscow's ability to convert roubles into dollars and other currencies.\", \"The Kremlin, which said before the leaders' video conference planned for Tuesday US time\\u00a0it did not expect any breakthroughs, has denied harbouring such intentions and has said its troop posture is defensive.\", \"But it has also said it is increasingly vexed by Western military aid to Ukraine and what it calls creeping NATO expansion.\", \"It has likewise queried Ukrainian intentions and said it wanted\\u00a0guarantee\\u00a0that Kyiv would not use force to try to retake Crimea \\u2014 territory lost in 2014 to Russian-backed separatists \\u2014 a scenario Ukraine has ruled out.\", \"\\\"We're looking for good, predictable relations with the United States,\\\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.\", \"Calling for everyone to keep \\\"a cool head\\\", Mr Peskov said it was vital Mr Putin and Mr Biden spoke, given what he called the extraordinary escalation of tensions in Europe.\", \"The Russian rouble weakened slightly on Tuesday, with some market analysts predicting the talks would de-escalate tensions and others saying the US\\u00a0sanctions threat eroded hopes of finding common ground.\", \"Ukraine's defence ministry on Tuesday accused Russia of deploying tanks and additional sniper teams to the front line of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">European allies back Biden\\u00a0</div>\", \"Ahead of his first direct talks with Mr Putin since July, Mr Biden discussed the sanctions plan with European allies, seeking a strong joint stance in support of Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty.\", \"He spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\", \"They called on Russia to de-escalate tensions and return to diplomacy and said their teams would stay in close touch, including in consultation with NATO allies and EU partners, on a \\\"coordinated and comprehensive approach,\\\" the White House said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What sanctions are being considered?</div>\", \"Mr Biden's team had\\u00a0identified a set of economic penalties to impose should Russia launch an invasion, a senior Biden administration official said.\", \"A separate source familiar with the situation said targeting Mr Putin's inner circle had\\u00a0been discussed but no decision made.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/dd2e97d77cb6bd63d821ebbc97927a8a\\\"

Russia's biggest banks and curbing the conversion of roubles into dollars and other currencies were also being considered, another source said.\", \"German Gref, the chief executive of Russia's top bank, Sberbank, on Tuesday called that idea \\\"nonsense\\\" and \\\"impossible to execute\\\".\", \"CNN reported sanctions could include the extreme step of disconnecting Russia from the SWIFT international payment system used by banks around the world.\", \"Bloomberg reported the United States and European allies were weighing measures targeting the Russian Direct Investment Fund.\", \"The United States could also restrict the ability of investors to buy Russian debt on the secondary market, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter.\", \"The White House declined to comment.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Diplomacy before sanctions\\u00a0</div>\", \"White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said it remained unclear whether Mr Putin had made a final decision to invade

where Russian-backed separatists control a large part of Ukrainian territory.\", \"The United States has urged both countries to return to a set of largely unimplemented agreements signed in 2014 and 2015 which were designed to end the war in eastern Ukraine.\", \"\\\"He (Mr Biden)\\u00a0will make clear that there will be very real costs should Russia choose to proceed, but he will also make clear that there is an effective way forward with respect to diplomacy,\\\" the senior Biden administration told reporters.\", \"The two leaders head into the talks with scant room for compromise.\", \"Mr Putin has said he wants legally binding guarantees NATO will not expand further eastwards and a pledge that certain types of weapons will not be deployed in countries close to Russia, including Ukraine.\", \"Mr Putin is expected to raise the possibility of holding another US-Russia summit with Mr Biden too.
