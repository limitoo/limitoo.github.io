I could read those every night.\", \"What\\u2019s the last great book you read?\", \"\\u201cPostcolonial Love Poem,\\u201d by Natalie Diaz.\", \"Who are your favorite writers \\u2014 novelists, essayists, critics, memoirists, poets \\u2014 working today?\", \"Oh wow, there\\u2019s so many! Some are Ocean Vuong, Clint Smith, Madeline Miller, Tracy K. Smith, Jeremy O. Harris and Roxane Gay.\", \"Describe your ideal reading experience (when, where, what, how).\", \"A fireplace is crackling nearby, I have warm tea in my hands, a blanket over my lap and a thick, well-loved book in my hands.\", \"When did you start reading poetry? What books made you fall in love with poetry?\", \"I actually started writing poetry before I started reading it, mostly because at the time poetry wasn\\u2019t something that was taught robustly in my classrooms. Around middle school a writing mentor introduced me to the writing of Sonia Sanchez, and gave me a book of her new and selected poems, \\u201cShake Loose My Skin.\\u201d I fell in love with it and reread it every day. After that I got my hands on a copy of \\u201cAngles of Ascent: A Norton Anthology of African American Poetry,\\u201d and I just had this feeling of: Oh, these are my people.\", \"Was there a book of poems or a poet in particular that inspired you to write?\", \"These aren\\u2019t poems, but I\\u2019d say \\u201cThe Bluest Eye,\\u201d by Toni Morrison, and \\u201cDandelion Wine,\\u201d by Ray Bradbury, really jump-started my interest in writing as a craft. When I came across these works as a young reader, I so deeply wanted to understand how these writers had arrived at these stories.\", \"Which poets continue to inspire you in your work?\", \"That\\u2019s like asking me about the air I breathe. Just a handful are Gwendolyn Brooks, Lucille Clifton, Federico Garc\\u00eda Lorca, Rainer Maria Rilke, Octavia E. Butler and Maya Angelou.\", \"Are there poets for whom you\\u2019ve gained greater appreciation over time?\", \"Shakespeare, hands down, which might seem a bit elementary since he occupies such a center stage in literature. Yet for the longest time I was ambivalent, if not outright dubious, of Shakespeare, for that very same reason. He just felt like another ancient dead white guy that my teachers were trying to shove into my brain when I was desperate to read someone who looked like me. When I was in college, I had this moment of thinking: If you\\u2019re going to close yourself off to an author, at least read them to understand why. I owed that to myself and to literature. So I pushed myself to take a course called Global Shakespeare, taught by Dr. Leah Whittington, and I fell in love. I think it was finally being able to read Shakespeare through a global, racial and gendered lens that made me see him anew.\", \"If you were to write something besides poetry, what would it be?\", \"Novels. Novel writing was my original love, and I still hope to do it. I just typically can finish writing a single poem faster than I can an entire narrative book!\", \"What books do you find yourself returning to again and again?\", \"All of them. If I read something once, I tend to reread it at least three times. There\\u2019s some I return to for the craft they can teach me. For example, \\u201cAmerican Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin,\\u201d by Terrance Hayes, is a master class in the form; I\\u2019ll reread \\u201cWade in the Water,\\u201d by Tracy K. Smith, when I need a lesson on how to structure poems on the page; and I\\u2019ll reread \\u201cThe World\\u2019s Wife,\\u201d by Carol Ann Duffy, when I need to get into the poetic head of a character who has been silenced.\", \"What genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?\", \"I love me some fantasy \\u2014 world building? Yes, please. I\\u2019m too much of a wimp to read horror, though I have been pleasantly surprised by thrillers like \\u201cMy Sister, the Serial Killer,\\u201d by Oyinkan Braithwaite.\", \"Do you count any books as guilty pleasures?\", \"Not really. Maybe young adult novels, though I don\\u2019t consider this guilty so much as underestimated. I love young adult novels. It\\u2019s just a shame that for the longest time they weren\\u2019t thought of as great works of literature, which they can be and are. I think we see that among the likes of \\u201cThe Hate You Give,\\u201d \\u201cThe Giver,\\u201d etc.\", \"What\\u2019s the last book you read that made you laugh?\", \"Whenever I read the Percy Jackson series, I bust out a gut.\", \"The last book you read that made you cry?\", \"\\u201cA Promise to Remember: The Names Project Book of Letters.\\u201d\", \"The last book you read that made you furious?\", \"\\u201cZong!,\\u201d by M. NourbeSe Philip.\", \"How do you organize your books?\", \"By genre, and then by cover color within that genre. And then by some sporadic illogic that no one else could understand.\", \"What books might we be surprised to find on your shelves?\", \"\\u201cThe Complete Guide to Watercolor.\\u201d \\u201cThe Complete Idiot\\u2019s Guide to Journalism.\\u201d I\\u2019d reread that all the time growing up when I was trying to imagine how to pay bills as a writer.\", \"What\\u2019s the most interesting thing you\\u2019ve learned from a book recently?\", \"In drawing, the edge of a shadow closest to the primary light source typically receives the least reflected light, so that area actually tends to be the darkest.\", \"Who\\u2019s your favorite fictional hero or heroine?\", \"Hermione Granger.\", \"Do books serve a moral function, in your view? How so?\", \"Yes. Even if we don\\u2019t set out for them to have a moral function, they do achieve a moral impact. For example, we generally think of reading as serving primarily an academic capacity. But we know reading also increases children\\u2019s emotional intelligence. Books have the power to change how we see ourselves and others. The choice is ours to harness that potential.\", \"You\\u2019re throwing a literary dinner party. What three writers, living or dead, do you invite?\", \"Shakespeare, Phillis Wheatley, Lin-Manuel Miranda.\", \"What books are you embarrassed not to have read yet?\", \"The \\u201cGame of Thrones\\u201d series.\", \"What do you plan to read next?\", \"Everything. But I\\u2019ll start with finishing \\u201cFour Hundred Souls,\\u201d edited by Ibram X. Kendi and Keisha N. Blain, and starting \\u201cA Ghost in the Throat,\\u201d by Doireann N\\u00ed Ghr\\u00edofa.\"]","href_hash":"c6518fea58d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c6518fea58d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}},
