We are following two elements of the fallout from the scandal that led to Andrew Cuomo\\u2019s resignation as governor in August. We\\u2019ll also look at whether New York City is ready for the Omicron variant.\", \"As the sexual harassment scandal involving Andrew Cuomo continues to reverberate, CNN suspended the former governor\\u2019s brother, Chris Cuomo. And the forcible touching charge against Andrew Cuomo, filed by the Albany County sheriff\\u2019s office last month, may be tough to prove.\", \"My colleagues Michael Grynbaum and John Koblin write that Chris Cuomo, CNN\\u2019s highest-rated anchor, said on Wednesday that he was embarrassed by the suspension. He told listeners on his SiriusXM satellite radio show that \\u201cit hurts to even say it,\\u201d but that he understood CNN\\u2019s decision.\", \"He said \\u201cthe last thing I ever wanted to do was compromise any of my colleagues\\u201d by advising his brother\\u2019s top aides \\u2014 a breach of basic journalistic rules. Thousands of pages of evidence released on Monday showed that Chris Cuomo\\u2019s role in trying to head off the scandal was deeper than had been known.\", \"CNN said it would pursue a \\u201cfurther evaluation\\u201d of the evidence but declined to comment on the exact nature of that evaluation, calling it an internal matter. Someone who has been briefed on the company\\u2019s plans said that CNN did not intend to hire an outside law firm or forensic investigators for the review, which is expected to focus on journalistic lines that Cuomo may have crossed. The network is also focusing on comparing the evidence released this week with what the anchor had told executives.\", \"[CNN and Chris Cuomo Face Difficult Questions After Anchor\\u2019s Suspension]\", \"For Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN, the suspension was a shift. For months, Zucker had defended Chris Cuomo, even as details surfaced that he had strategized with his brother\\u2019s aides. In May, the network called the anchor\\u2019s actions \\u201cinappropriate,\\u201d and he apologized on the air. But Zucker also told CNN employees that the anchor \\u201cis human, and these are very unique circumstances.\\u201d\", \"Zucker told CNN staff members on Wednesday that the decision to suspend Cuomo was his. It came after the testimony and text messages released on Monday showed that Cuomo sent feedback on his brother\\u2019s public statements and attempted to check on the status of news articles in the works that could have been damaging to Andrew Cuomo. \\u201cChris sends me a lot of things a lot of the time,\\u201d one former top aide, Melissa DeRosa, told investigators.\", \"As for the forcible touching charge, my colleague Grace Ashford writes that the case will present challenges.\", \"[Why It Might Be Difficult to Convict Andrew Cuomo of Forcible Touching]\", \"The complaint is based on the account of Brittany Commisso, a former executive assistant to Andrew Cuomo. She has told investigators that he reached under her blouse late last year and groped her breast while they were alone in the Executive Mansion. Cuomo has denied the allegations.\", \"Evidence filed by the Albany County sheriff \\u2014 including cellphone records, official schedules, card swipes, emails and flight logs \\u2014 attempts to place Cuomo and Commisso in the same room at the same time. As with most forcible touching cases, there is no known irrefutable physical evidence against Cuomo, putting the weight of the prosecution on the accuser\\u2019s testimony.\", \"Commisso has said that she did not tell anyone about it until many months later, in part because her supervisor was the governor\\u2019s \\u201cright-hand person.\\u201d\", \"But prosecutors may face challenges in establishing when the incident occurred. She first told investigators for the attorney general that it happened in November, possibly on Nov. 16. The sheriff, Craig Apple, working with investigators for the State Assembly, determined that a more likely date was Dec. 7.\", \"Cuomo\\u2019s defense team has seized on the dates and other inconsistencies in an effort to undermine Commisso\\u2019s credibility.\", \"Prepare for a mostly cloudy day, with wind gusts and a chance of showers into early evening. Temps will drop from the high 50s during the day to the low 40s at night.\", \"In effect until Dec. 8 (Immaculate Conception).\", \"How worried about the new Omicron variant should New Yorkers be, now that the first case has been reported in the United States? Will Omicron send caseloads and hospitalizations surging in New York and bring on new lockdowns? Or will it be more like the Delta variant, which the city seems to have weathered?\", \"My colleague Joseph Goldstein writes that the answers hinge on whether the new variant turns out to be more contagious and more resistant to vaccines than Delta. Scientists will probably not know for weeks, although initial reports suggest that the Omicron variant might be more contagious than earlier forms of Covid-19.\", \"For now, officials note that New York has a strong surveillance and testing system for spotting the new variant. Another factor in New York\\u2019s favor is that New Yorkers have been far more willing to wear masks than people in some other parts of the country. And the vaccination rate is higher than in most American cities. Roughly 77 percent of New Yorkers have had at least one shot, and nearly 89 percent of adults have had at least one.\", \"\\u201cI think we are potentially more prepared than most,\\u201d said Dr. Bernard Camins, an infectious diseases specialist and medical director of infection prevention for the Mount Sinai Health System. \\u201cThe question is whether at this point people are more fatigued from all those mitigation strategies, and they may not listen.\\u201d\", \"Amid the unknowns, Mayor Bill de Blasio\\u2019s advice was straightforward. Get vaccinated or get a booster shot, and \\u201cget those masks back on now,\\u201d he said. That was on Monday. On Tuesday, the mayor was asked why he had merely recommended wearing masks rather than mandating it. He answered that vaccination was the priority. \\u201cWe got a mask mandate as an option if we get more specific data that tells us it\\u2019s needed,\\u201d he said.\", \"Valerie Steele has ultimate responsibility for 4,000 pairs of shoes. \\u201cMore than Imelda Marcos had,\\u201d Steele said, referring to the notoriously flamboyant \\u2014 or flamboyantly notorious \\u2014 former first lady of the Philippines, \\u201calthough I think she said she didn\\u2019t have 3,000 pairs after all.\\u201d Only 1,060, according to a 1987 inventory.\", \"Steele is the director and chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which is holding a virtual symposium called \\u201cStilettos to Sneakers\\u201d on Friday.
