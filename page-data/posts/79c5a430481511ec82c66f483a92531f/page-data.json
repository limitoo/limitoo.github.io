An aviation alert was issued to aircrafts. The cloud would not go above 7,000 feet, scientists estimated.\", \"A light dusting of ash can fall on nearby communities because of some of these events.\", \"\\\"This particular one looks like it's not as ash rich as some of the other ones so there's probably going to be negligible ash fallout from it,\\\" Schwaiger said.\", \"The Novarupta eruption is unique because it produced a lot of pyroclastic flows that came to rest on land, specifically the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, according to the National Park Service.
