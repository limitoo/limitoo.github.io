Hospitals needed refrigerated trucks to manage the overflow of bodies in their morgues. In less than three months, California\\u2019s death toll from Covid-19 more than doubled.\", \"So, with our second pandemic winter nearly upon us, will disaster strike again?\", \"Coronavirus cases in California have been ticking up since late October. The state is preparing for the possibility of a winter surge \\u2014 what Gov. Gavin Newsom last week called his \\u201cbiggest anxiety.\\u201d\", \"But unlike last year, 76 percent of Californians have gotten at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. That means that while the holiday season may again lead to more transmission of the virus, the consequences will be less ruinous, experts say.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think we\\u2019ll have the same huge peak we had last winter, but I do think we will see another peak,\\u201d Dr. Timothy Brewer, an infectious-disease expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, told me. \\u201cAnd the big difference will be because of the large number of people vaccinated.\\u201d\", \"Getting your Covid-19 shots remains the best way to protect against serious illness. And as of last week, all Californians can now receive booster doses to enhance immunity.\", \"But the fact remains that some 9.5 million Californians are totally unvaccinated against the coronavirus. And that\\u2019s where things get tricky.\", \"Even in a place like San Francisco, which has one of the highest vaccination rates in the state, tens of thousands of people \\u2014 roughly a quarter of the city\\u2019s population \\u2014 aren\\u2019t fully vaccinated, according to a New York Times vaccination tracker. And some residents who have gotten their shots may have had their immunity wane in recent months.\", \"\\u201cFrom an individual perspective, I feel really safe,\\u201d said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who added that she and her family had gotten their boosters. \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t feel like the city where I live, the state where I live, will be out of the woods. That I don\\u2019t feel confident about.\\u201d\", \"Bibbins-Domingo and others worry that hospitals could still be overloaded, mostly by unvaccinated individuals, as the virus takes off this winter. Unvaccinated Californians are nearly 10 times more likely to be hospitalized with Covid-19 as those who are fully immunized.\", \"The next few months concern epidemiologists because the coronavirus appears to follow a seasonal pattern \\u2014 similar to how the flu proliferates in the winter \\u2014 that causes a peak in California in the summer and a bigger one around the end of the year.\", \"Plus, the arrival of chillier weather pushes people to socialize indoors, where it\\u2019s easier for the virus to spread. And during the Thanksgiving and winter holidays, families and friends from multiple households tend to congregate, further increasing the chances of coronavirus transmission.\", \"These conditions could mean that regions with large numbers of unvaccinated people, such as the Central Valley and far Northern California, could see disastrous overflows in their hospitals, experts say. (Already, these regions have the highest level of transmission in the state.)\", \"Still, even if California logs as many new coronavirus cases as it did last winter (which seems unlikely), the death toll won\\u2019t approach the same heights because so many people have protection conferred by the vaccines.\", \"In recent days, some experts have been calling for California to focus on hospitalizations instead of case numbers, since most people who become infected won\\u2019t also become seriously ill.\", \"Brewer, the U.C.L.A. physician, recommended that vaccinated Californians think about holiday precautions differently than they did last year, when officials asked everyone to stay home.\", \"He instead suggested figuring out what Covid-19 precautions can make your gatherings safer. The most important thing, he said, is to make sure that everyone you spend time with is vaccinated. Then perhaps consider avoiding parties with hundreds of people.\", \"\\u201cI think what people need to realize is that this virus is not going away,\\u201d Brewer told me. \\u201cSo going into the holidays, people need to recognize that the coronavirus will be out there. There will be transmission. There will be cases, and the question just is: What is your comfort level in terms of trying to go on with your life?\\u201d\", \"For more:\", \"The proliferation of untraceable firearms known as \\u201cghost guns\\u201d has reached epidemic proportions in California.\", \"Homeowners are trying to build disaster-proof houses.\", \"The ultimate pumpkin pie.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes Lori Silver, who recommends Paso Robles:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.
