able to go out and get a cup of coffee\\\".\", \"Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk last week announced restrictions for unvaccinated people\\u00a0from December 17, or whenever the state's vaccination of people aged 16 and over\\u00a0hits 80 per cent.\", \"Under the new rules, only fully vaccinated people will be able to attend pubs, clubs, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres, music festivals and stadiums, where all staff also need to have had two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.\", \"\\\"As we get above 80 per cent in particular, which the scientific advice shows us and the research shows us, that means Australian's can have their lives back,\\\" Mr Morrison said.\", \"\\\"They should be able to go out and get a cup of coffee in Brisbane, when you're over 80 per cent regardless of whether you've had the vaccines or not.\\\"\", \"Mr Morrison said Australians had \\\"kept their part of the deal\\\" by getting to 80 per cent double vaccinated.\", \"\\\"Australians have done an amazing job when it comes to leading us through this pandemic, but now it's time for governments to step back, and for Australians to take their lives back, and for Australians to be able to move forward with the freedoms that should be theirs,\\\" he said.\", \"Ms Palaszczuk accused the Prime Minister of trying to undermine the state's vaccine roll out.\", \"\\\"It is extremely disappointing that the Prime Minister of our country is seeking now to undermine Queensland's strong vaccination program,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"It is extremely disappointing not standing up for Queensland, and what Queenslanders want and what Queenslanders are doing.\", \"\\\"Once again wanting to undermine the good work that Queensland has done.\\\"\", \"Ms Palaszczuk said Mr Morrison's comments were \\\"reckless\\\" and she made no apologies for the government's roadmap on opening state's border and the incoming restrictions.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Queenslanders have supported our strong action, they have voted on this issue and they continue to support our strong stance ,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Schoolies 'good to go'</div>\", \"Meanwhile, Ms Palaszczuk has confirmed Queensland's Schoolies Week celebrations on the Gold Coast will be able to go ahead after a COVID-19 cluster\\u00a0detected in the city last week was \\\"sufficiently contained\\\".\", \"The Premier said last week the annual festival for school-leavers, which is scheduled to begin on Friday, was at risk but was now \\\"good to go\\\".\", \"\\\"I know that this will be good news to the 53,000 Queensland teenagers who are finishing their school days and many of them will be heading off to schoolies celebrations across our great state,\\\" Ms Palaszczuk\\u00a0told state parliament this morning.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/55a5e09afd1d2978c4973edfa1540a7e\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Schoolies Week celebrations are \\\"good to go\\\" on the Gold Coast, the Premier says.(ABC News: Damien Larkins)</div>\", \"\\\"Our year 12s have completed their final two years of schooling under the shadow of COVID, they have seen many events cancelled.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The class of '21 have had to learn to adapt and most impressive or simply get on with it no matter what was thrown at them.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"They don't get nearly enough credit for their resilience so I'm saying it now \\u2014 congratulations you made it.\\\"\", \"No new cases of COVID-19 have been detected in Queensland in the past\\u00a024 hours.\", \"Ms Palaszczuk said 71.6 per cent of Queenslanders aged 16 or older have now had two doses of a vaccine.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Goondiwindi 'the most profound test case'</div>\", \"The Premier also announced that from midday the border town of Goondiwindi would no longer be a restricted area and all restrictions placed on\\u00a0visitors to vulnerable settings would be lifted.\", \"Queensland Health said from that time there would also be no restrictions for\\u00a0visits to vulnerable facilities elsewhere in Queensland for people who have been in Goondiwindi in the past 14 days.\", \"Goondiwindi Mayor Lawrence Springborg said he believed the town's handling of the outbreak would promote\\u00a0the positive gains of high vaccination rates to\\u00a0other regional communities in Australia.\", \"\\\"I think that we are probably really the most profound test case of what happens when COVID arrives in a community, which has prepared itself with a high level of vaccination,\\\" Mr Springborg said.\", \"He said the difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated communities was clear, with hundreds of active cases in the neighbouring Moree Plains Local Government Area in north-western New South Wales.\"]","href_hash":"988a5ea3480f11eca1c3df62a770e31d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"988a5ea3480f11eca1c3df62a770e31d"}},
