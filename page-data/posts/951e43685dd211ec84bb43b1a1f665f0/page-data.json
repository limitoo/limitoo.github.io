Therefore, to use that as the overarching number one criteria, the basis of that is questionable,\\\" Murphy said.\", \"He said he wouldn't suggest that fees should not be a part of the assessment in any fund selection process, but believed they should be one of several criteria in a more balanced assessment.\", \"Murphy said other criteria should include looking at the providers' investment teams and processes, alongside the fees.\", \"\\\"When the best-performing balanced fund provider over five years, seven years and 10 years - Milford - doesn't even bother applying for default provider status, knowing it would have little chance of success given that its fees are some of the highest in the market, then the process must surely come into question.\", \"\\\"Surely any review of default providers should be aiming to attract the best-performing funds over the long term, as that is what will best meet the stated objective 'to enhance the financial well-being of default members, particularly at retirement' for the largest cohort of KiwiSaver members rather than a philosophical focus on just one data point-low fees.\\\"\", \"The report said with several new entrants to the default space all offering low fees, it should be asked if being a default KiwiSaver provider was commercially viable for most firms.\", \"It said if low fees were the main focus the government wanted to see in default funds, it could create and run one central default fund, where it can control fees without commercial considerations.\"]","href_hash":"951e43685dd211ec84bb43b1a1f665f0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"951e43685dd211ec84bb43b1a1f665f0"}},
