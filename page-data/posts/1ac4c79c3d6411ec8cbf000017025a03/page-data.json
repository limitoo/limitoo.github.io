Things became a little clearer, we identified that this person was a person of interest, a suspect, and it led from there,\\u201d Rod Wilde, the lead detective on the case, said at a news conference.\", \"The Western Australia police minister, Paul Papalia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t a random tip or a clairvoyant or any of the sort of things that you might hear. It was just hard police grind.\\u201d\", \"On Wednesday, the police commissioner, Chris Dawson, told reporters that \\u201cinformation about a car was really important.\\u201d The police had previously spoken about a vehicle that was seen traveling away from the family\\u2019s campsite in the early hours of the morning Cleo was taken.\", \"Local news media reported that neighbors had seen the suspect buying diapers and had heard a child crying in his house. The authorities also said that roadway CCTV footage and cellphone data had aided their search, which included a task force of more than 100 officers, military surveillance planes and a reward of 1 million Australian dollars, or $740,000.\", \"\\u201cMy name is Cleo,\\u201d the girl said to the four police officers who forced their way into the suspect\\u2019s locked home in the small town of Carnarvon around 1 a.m. on Wednesday. The police later said that \\u201cthe lights were on and she was playing with toys\\u201d when they found her.\", \"The suspect was arrested shortly before Cleo was rescued, outside and on the same street as the house, the authorities said. The police believe the man acted alone.\", \"He appeared at the Carnarvon courthouse on Thursday. Local journalists who attended the hearing reported that he did not apply for bail. He was barefoot and appeared agitated at the presence of reporters, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\", \"The man was taken to a hospital on Wednesday for what the police said were self-inflicted injuries. He was taken to the hospital again on Thursday morning, the police said, adding that they did not believe his injuries were serious.\", \"The premier of Western Australia, Mark McGowan, and two detectives who led the investigation and rescue mission visited Cleo and her family on Thursday.\", \"Detective-Senior Sergeant Cameron Blaine said afterward at a news conference that Cleo was in good health. \\u201cIt\\u2019s really good to see that she\\u2019s adjusted,\\u201d he said. \\u201cShe\\u2019s getting some sleep, she\\u2019s playing in the backyard, exactly how you would expect of my daughter when she was 4.\\u201d\", \"She will still need to be interviewed by child-specialist officers to determine what exactly happened during her abduction, the police said.\", \"There has been a sense of unease in Carnarvon following the arrest, local media reported. After one news station mistakenly reported that an Aboriginal man was the person in custody, he was reportedly inundated with threats. The news station later apologized.\", \"The local government has called on residents to \\u201cmaintain our unity, positivity and community spirit,\\u201d and the police asked residents not to theorize about the case online.\", \"\\u201cPlease don\\u2019t speculate, don\\u2019t get on Facebook, type in wild theories. There\\u2019s been a lot of it through this investigation. It\\u2019s unhelpful, we see that it\\u2019s untrue, it only damages people,\\u201d Mr. Wilde, the lead detective, said on local radio.\", \"On Thursday night, a post on a Facebook profile that purported to belong to the suspect had attracted over 3,000 comments, and people online circulated lists of social media handles they believed belonged to him.\"]","href_hash":"1ac4c79c3d6411ec8cbf000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1ac4c79c3d6411ec8cbf000017025a03"}},
