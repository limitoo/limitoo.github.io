When she saw the downside of fame, she stepped back and built a life beyond the halfpipe.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-14T10:29:21.000Z","content":"[\"LOS ANGELES \\u2014 The American snowboarder Chloe Kim was 17 years old at the last Winter Olympics, in Pyeongchang, where she gleefully stomped her way to a gold medal in the halfpipe.\", \"Her near-perfect runs came after a viral tweet about breakfast (\\u201cI\\u2019m getting hangry,\\u201d she wrote moments before her performance) and ended in the embrace of her parents, immigrants from South Korea. Hers may have been the biggest moment of the Olympics for two countries.\", \"Soon, though, she thought of retiring.\", \"Success felt like a tightening trap. She suffocated under the crush of instant attention, a perk and curse of Olympic success. One of her dominant memories from winning was escaping to a bathroom just to be alone, to get a look at the medal she had earned. Why did it feel like her big moment belonged to everyone else?\", \"And then there was the Instagram message she received after the Games, a note from a top snowboarder. It was intended for someone else. It landed in Kim\\u2019s phone.\", \"\\u201cCocky ass bitch,\\u201d it called her.\", \"It stung. The barb is still hooked inside.\", \"\\u201cMy 17-, 18-year-old self was a lot more immature \\u2014 like screw it all, I\\u2019m done,\\u201d Kim said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to take a break and revisit this conversation later.\\u201d\", \"Later has arrived. Kim, 21, has soared past the age of innocence to land back here, the favorite to win at another Olympics, yet unsure of what people make of her.\", \"\\u201cWhen I was 13 and I was up and coming and I was doing really well in events, it was like everyone was on my side,\\u201d she said. \\u201cLike, \\u2018Go, Chloe!\\u2019 and \\u2018Good job, Chloe, look at you go!\\u2019 Then after I won, the energy completely changed, and I was embarrassed to win contests. I knew that if I did well again, people would dump on me.\\u201d\", \"And then the errant message.\", \"\\u201cI just felt like everyone is out to get me or something,\\u201d Kim said. \\u201cSo I was like, OK, if I\\u2019m going to be the villain in the story, then I don\\u2019t know if I want to do it. It\\u2019s just not fun.\\u201d\", \"She broke her right ankle in early 2019, a blessing in retrospect, shooing her away from the sport she was not sure she loved, or that loved her. She slipped from the spotlight. She spent 22 months without strapping into a snowboard, an unheard-of voluntary detox for a top athlete just reaching her prime.\", \"She went to Princeton and tried to be a regular college student. She sought out friends with diverse interests and backgrounds. She surrounded herself with people and things that reciprocate love, regardless of snowboarding success: dogs, horses, a boyfriend, new school friends, family.\", \"Kim returned from her snowboarding hiatus last January, more refreshed than rusty. She won her first event, then the X Games, then the world championship.\", \"This week, she begins her Olympic season with a Dew Tour stop in Copper Mountain, Colo., against an international field. She will be expected to win every contest she enters, especially the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing in February.\", \"This is how it goes for top Olympic athletes: Win a gold medal, fade away while the real world churns on, then reappear on television screens four years later, as if someone undid the Olympic \\u201cpause\\u201d button.\", \"But Kim did not pause. She grew up. She is still funny, smart, silly. But she is older, wiser, hardened.\", \"She repeated the words of the Instagram insult. She would not say who wrote them.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s definitely one of those things that I wish I didn\\u2019t see, but I\\u2019m also grateful,\\u201d Kim said. \\u201cIf I didn\\u2019t see it, I would have been, like, \\u2018Oh, cool, we\\u2019re still all good.\\u2019 It\\u2019s helpful for me to know. It definitely made me put my guard up a little more, which I think is OK. You can\\u2019t trust anyone.\\u201d\", \"The front entry of Kim\\u2019s new house was a pileup of shoes, mostly Nike-branded sneakers and flip flops. It was a warm fall day, and Kim was excited about her plans. She slipped into a pair of worn cowboy boots.\", \"She and her boyfriend, Evan Berle, a U.C.L.A. student and former pro skateboarder, drove through Torrance, Calif., one of several suburbs where Kim grew up. They hurried to an appointment at a small stable in Palos Verdes Estates, among rolling hills of ranch homes and twisting roads.\", \"Kim has ridden horses nearly as long as she has snowboarded. It is unclear which brings her the most happiness.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019d like to purchase a ranch,\\u201d Kim said from the passenger seat as Berle drove. \\u201cHave chickens, little pigs \\u2026 \\u201d\", \"\\u201cGoats,\\u201d Berle interjected.\", \"\\u201cEvan loves goats,\\u201d Kim explained. \\u201cI love pigs. Oh, and I love donkeys. Maybe some exotic animals, too. Like parrots.\\u201d\", \"She told a story about losing her pet parrot, Kiwi, a blue-crowned conure, when it flew away a few years ago. Nothing sounds too tragic or too amazing when it comes from Kim. She is adept at delivering lines in a pleasant deadpan.\", \"At the corral, Kim and Berle watched a farrier re-shoe several horses while they waited for the trail guide. There was a mix-up over the meeting time, and Kim grew frustrated with the delay. She had other things to do, including a midday workout with her trainer. She wanted to leave.\", \"Berle works as a steadying influence. He talked her into waiting. They met in 2019 through mutual friends in the skateboarding world.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m glad I met you now, because I was not cute when I was younger,\\u201d Kim said.\", \"The guide arrived. She had no idea who Kim was. Kim perked up, helped saddle a chestnut named Levi, and smoothly climbed on. She led the way down the trail. She turned back to Berle and beamed.\", \"That easygoing effervescence, combined with singular talent, made Kim a major star in 2018. She won ESPYs for best female athlete, best female Olympian and best female action-sports athlete.\", \"There were magazine covers (including Sports Illustrated, with Reese, her Australian shepherd), late-night interviews, a Corn Flakes box. There was a Kim-inspired Barbie doll, a cameo in a Maroon 5 video and an Oscar-acceptance-speech shout out from Frances McDormand (\\u201cI think this is what Chloe Kim must have felt like after doing back-to-back 1080s in the Olympic halfpipe,\\u201d McDormand said.)\", \"Kim went along with it all. In hindsight, it was too much.\", \"\\u201cPeople just forget that you\\u2019re young,\\u201d she said. \\u201cLike, they say that you\\u2019re young in the headlines, but they don\\u2019t treat you like a kid.\\u201d\", \"That fall, she announced that she had enrolled at Princeton.\", \"\\u201cI just need some Chloe time,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI need to be human. I need to be a normal kid for once, because I haven\\u2019t been able to do that my whole life.\\u201d\", \"She took physics, French, history and dropped a chemistry course because it was too hard, she said. Her favorite class was anthropology. She joined the equestrian club for a bit \\u2014 she found that she did not fit in, she said \\u2014 and lived alone.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t want a roommate,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWhat if my roommate was crazy and, like, posted pictures of me sleeping or something?\\u201d\", \"But she was determined to fit in, attending parties, football games and campus events. Kezia Dickson, a student from New York, vaguely knew who Kim was. She saw people stare at Kim in the dining hall. She heard them whisper, \\u201cOh, my God, that\\u2019s Chloe Kim,\\u201d as Kim played pool.\", \"Dickson sensed how uncomfortable it must be. She introduced herself and, at some point, mentioned that she was struggling in French, a language familiar to Kim.\", \"\\u201cChloe gave me her phone number and was like, \\u2018I really like chatting with you, and if you ever need help in French, just reach out to me,\\u2019\\u201d Dickson recalled. \\u201cI did, and she actually answered the phone. And then we went to the library and she tutored me for three hours. And she would do it every other week.\\u201d\", \"Kim was drawn to people who knew little about snowboarding.\", \"\\u201cShe was really trying to branch out, and the people that she\\u2019s remained close with are nothing like her in terms of experiences,\\u201d Dickson said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what she appreciated \\u2014 getting to know people for their experiences, and not what they\\u2019re trying to accomplish.\\u201d\", \"The coronavirus pandemic closed down the campus in March 2020, late in Kim\\u2019s freshman year.\", \"\\u201cWell, Princeton thank you for everything for real,\\u201d Kim wrote on Twitter. \\u201cI feel like college has taught me so many things I couldn\\u2019t get through snowboarding and I am so grateful I took a step back to give myself this experience.\\u201d\", \"The public health crisis took a toll. Sequestered in her apartment, without the structure and distraction of school or snowboarding, Kim fell into a funk of loneliness and worry, she said.\", \"\\u201cMy boyfriend had to make me stop watching the news, because I would literally sit in front of the TV and cry,\\u201d Kim said. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t really know what the symptoms of depression were \\u2014 I just thought it meant you were sad, which is not the case. But I had other symptoms. I was really tired all the time. I slept a lot. I wasn\\u2019t motivated to do anything. It was hard for me to get out of bed and go take care of myself.\\u201d\", \"Among her worries were her parents, Jong Jin and Boran. Kim worried about them contracting Covid-19 and about the emerging wave of assaults against Asian Americans.\", \"In an as-told-to essay for espn.com in April, Kim said that she worried \\u201cevery time my parents step out the door\\u201d that they might be attacked.\", \"Kim spent a childhood trying to glide past her race, just trying to fit in. The break from snowboarding has altered her perspective.\", \"She now thinks of all the insults, intentional or not, she has endured and ignored \\u2014 from countless comments on social media to an incident in a restaurant years ago, when a group of men laughed at her with her family, surprised the little girl could speak English so well.\", \"\\u201cI started to get numb to it, and that\\u2019s a problem, right?\\u201d Kim said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve recently started to realize that it\\u2019s not something that I should have ever had to get used to. It shouldn\\u2019t happen.\\u201d\", \"Last spring, she joined the soccer player Alex Morgan, the basketball player Sue Bird and the swimmer Simone Manuel in launching a media and commerce company called Togethxr, where \\u201crepresentation and equality is the norm.\\u201d\", \"Snowboarding does not have a rich history of diversity, which Kim had noted in the ESPN essay.\", \"\\u201cThat becomes isolating, too,\\u201d she wrote last spring. \\u201cMy friends and teammates were supportive, but I just didn\\u2019t feel comfortable speaking about it because they couldn\\u2019t fully understand my experience. I never felt I could talk to anyone, and then being in the spotlight at a young age put me in another difficult situation. I feel very stuck sometimes.\\u201d\", \"The present tense was not a typo. Last summer, Kim began weekly therapy sessions.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m giving you a layer or two of the onion,\\u201d she said. \\u201cMy therapist gets the whole onion, to the core.\\u201d\", \"Last summer, she and Berle moved into a new and modern home on the west side of Los Angeles, not far from the beach. Her parents moved into her old apartment a few blocks away. It was a relief to have them close again. She sees them nearly every day.\", \"\\u201cIf I\\u2019m hungry or craving mom\\u2019s food, I\\u2019ll call my mom,\\u201d Kim said.\", \"At a gym in West Hollywood, Chloe Kim works out under the direction of Roy Chan. They connected in November 2020, the calendar churning toward the next Winter Olympics.\", \"The focus remains on strength and balance in the joints and the core. In the air, Kim rotates like a gymnast. Then she falls from 30 or more feet (the lip is 22 feet above the bottom of the halfpipe) and lands with her feet strapped in place. It is not uncommon for ribs to pop out of place.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019s very, very flexible, like hyper-mobile,\\u201d Chan said. \\u201cHer ability to contort and twist her body allows her to do all the tricks. We\\u2019ve got to make sure there is enough core stability to sustain impact.\\u201d\", \"Chan is now part of Kim\\u2019s close circle, another recent friend from outside of snowboarding. He, too, wishes that she would show the world more of her personality \\u2014 \\u201cin two words, she\\u2019s very kind and very funny,\\u201d he said \\u2014 and knows that Kim wants to be known as more than a snowboarder.\", \"\\u201cWe talk about this a lot,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe both know that right now, this is the platform. She needs to continue to win. It\\u2019s just part of her legacy, and we\\u2019re talking about a legacy athlete here.\\u201d\", \"Since her return to competition in January she has mostly fended off attention, knowing it is about to come, welcomed or not. She has not posted on Twitter in more than a year, and is a sporadic user of Instagram.\", \"It is revealing that her most notable public appearance of the past couple of years may have been in disguise, on \\u201cThe Masked Singer.\\u201d She made a surprisingly good showing, dressed as a jellyfish crooning Crazy, made famous by Patsy Cline.\", \"Another appearance came on Sesame Street, playing herself in a skit about snowboarding with Big Bird.\", \"That is the Kim who will re-emerge this winter in the public consciousness \\u2014 goofy, daring, charming \\u2014 but in charge, as much as she can be.\", \"\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not anywhere close to a gold medal,\\u201d Brolin Mawejje, a snowboarder competing for Uganda who has become friends with Kim, said. \\u201cBut having set my path within snowboarding, every once in a while you feel that pressure of, OK, people want something and I don\\u2019t know if I can offer everything. No one understands what you\\u2019re going through, but they\\u2019re quick to judge you based on something like winning a medal.\\u201d\", \"Kim\\u2019s athletic trajectory echoes that of Shaun White, a former teen sensation, now 35. Most know White as an Olympic snowboarder, a three-time gold medalist trying to make his fifth Winter Games, but he spent much of the time between working to be something else \\u2014 a skateboarder, a musician, an entrepreneur, an anonymous friend and family member.\", \"\\u201cWhen I was younger, I wanted to be more than I was at that time,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very hard to live in that situation, because it means that no matter how well things go, you still are feeling like you want more, and you want something different.\\u201d\", \"Now he views snowboarding as a bonus, he said, something fun he gets to do.\", \"Maybe Kim will compete deep into her 30s. Or maybe she will slide away from snowboarding after these Olympics. She does not say. She is unlikely to return to Princeton. Most of her friends there would be gone, she pointed out.\", \"For now, it is all about the Olympics again. Kim spent much of October in Switzerland, along with dozens of other top snowboarders and winter athletes, training on a glacier above Saas-Fee. Day after day, working with coach Rick Bower, she practiced in the halfpipe.\", \"She also joked with friends, played games with American teammates and seemed happy to be back in the game.\", \"But there were no judges and there was no audience. It was snowboarding without expectations. She might as well have been dressed in a jellyfish costume, or taking classes in New Jersey, or riding a horse with her boyfriend.\", \"She is about to reappear: Chloe Kim, the gold medalist, unpaused for our entertainment.\"]","href_hash":"9153ccfe5cc811ec9d251f7281e97d2c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9153ccfe5cc811ec9d251f7281e97d2c"}},
