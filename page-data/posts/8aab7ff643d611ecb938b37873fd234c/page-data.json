Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), acknowledged that the variant had been identified in the country in a White House COVID-19 press briefing on October 20, adding that \\\"there is no evidence that the sub-lineage AY.4.2 impacts the effectiveness of our current vaccines or therapeutics.\\\"\", \"While the U.K. currently treats AY.4.2 as a separate variant to the rest of Delta, the CDC still lists all AY lineages under the same \\\"Delta\\\" umbrella.\", \"AY.4.2 is only one sublineage of the Delta variant. There are dozens of descendants altogether.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931475/covid-vaccine-being-given.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A photo shows a COVID vaccine being administered at the John Knox Village Continuing Care Retirement Community in Florida on January 6, 2021.
