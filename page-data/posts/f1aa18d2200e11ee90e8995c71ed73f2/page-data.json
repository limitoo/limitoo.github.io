If you go this route, make sure you do your research to find a trustworthy seller based on previous customer reviews and the authenticity and purity of the gold offered. You'll also want to look up current spot prices for gold before you buy to make sure you're getting a solid deal.\", \"Another option for buying physical gold is working with a gold investment company.

These companies can help you buy the amount of IRA-eligible gold you want and find an IRS-approved custodian.\", \"Thinking about adding gold to your portfolio?
