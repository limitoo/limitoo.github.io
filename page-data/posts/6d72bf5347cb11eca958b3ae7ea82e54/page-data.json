Our own poll revealed that even though it's been more than 20 years since that episode first aired, most Americans aren't educated on how different cultures and faiths celebrate the holidays.\", \"\\\"That's why we're pleased to offer this service that can help to bridge this gap in festive education as well as offer the ultimate nostalgic festive Friends' fun!\\\"\", \"The site confirmed prospective applicants must be over 18 and fluent in English, although no formal qualifications are required.\", \"And they stressed: \\\"FandomSpot.com will provide guidance into various cultures' holidays for the professionals to communicate in their performance. A love of acting is also required as is a willingness to dress up and perform in character.\\\"\", \"While they don't specify how many positions are available, the hiring services asks how many armadillos are required, suggesting there are a few job openings.\", \"Anyone looking to apply to become the \\\"Professional Holiday Armadillo\\\"\\u2014or rent the armadillo for their own event\\u2014can do so here.\", \"The interesting character appears in season 7 episode 10, aptly called \\\"The One with the Holiday Armadillo.\\\" It sees Ross attempt to educate his son, Ben, on Hanukkah.\", \"But as all appropriate costumes have been snapped up, Ross is left with the armadillo.\", \"He tells his son: \\\"I'm the holiday armadillo. I'm a friend of Santa's, and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas.\\\"\", \"And when pressed by Monica where Santa is, Ross stresses: \\\"Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1934680/screengrab-friends-episode.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Screengrab from Friends season 7 episode 10, where Ross dresses as the holiday armadillo.
