It marked the first time that MacGowan had used videoconferencing software. \\u201cI\\u2019m very old-fashioned in a lot of ways,\\u201d said the singer, who was born in England to Irish parents and turned 64 on Christmas Day. He was streaming from the Dublin flat he shares with his wife, the Irish writer and artist Victoria Mary Clarke.\", \"MacGowan was tolerating this newfangled technology to discuss his upcoming book of never-before-seen artwork, handwritten lyrics and school essays, titled \\u201cThe Eternal Buzz and the Crock of Gold.\\u201d MacGowan and Clarke, 55, are releasing the sizable collection in partnership with Infinitum Nihil, the production company of their longtime friend Depp. (The couple are vocal supporters of the actor, who in 2020 lost a libel case against the British tabloid The Sun over its claims that he assaulted his ex-wife Amber Heard. Depp has denied the allegations.)\", \"MacGowan said he did the drawings included in the book \\u201cto amuse myself,\\u201d describing them as \\u201ccartoons.\\u201d He was sitting on a green sofa chair, with a big black throw pillow in front of him, which he used to prop up a small pile of his work that Clarke had put together. His wife positioned herself over his left shoulder, smiling at MacGowan\\u2019s jokes and helping to facilitate the conversation.\", \"Over the course of the hourlong video call, MacGowan\\u2019s speech and movements were slowed, and his trademark guttural laugh was muted. Since falling and breaking his pelvis in 2015, MacGowan has used a wheelchair to get around. He\\u2019s been in and out of the hospital to treat a variety of medical issues, including a broken knee, the result of another fall in February. (He is undergoing physical therapy.) \\u201cYou find out your bones are turned to dust,\\u201d MacGowan said, employing a profanity.\", \"It would appear a lifetime of hard living has led to the singer\\u2019s physical decline. \\u201cWhen I met him, he was very much a hell-raiser, who would drink everything that was in front of him, take any drug you could think of and always step out in front of cars,\\u201d Clarke, who began an on-and-off again relationship with MacGowan when she was 20, said in a separate interview. \\u201cI think he just thought he was indestructible,\\u201d she added. \\u201cThis is the first time that he\\u2019s ever had to face the possibility that he isn\\u2019t superhuman.\\u201d\", \"Questions about how long MacGowan has for this earth have trailed him for much of his adult life. \\u201cQuite soon after I met him, somebody said to me, \\u2018You realize he\\u2019s only got about six months to live,\\u2019\\u201d Clarke recalled. More recently, Sinead O\\u2019Connor \\u2014 a longtime friend and onetime musical collaborator of MacGowan\\u2019s \\u2014 expressed doubts about his will to go on in a new authorized biography, \\u201cA Furious Devotion: The Life of Shane MacGowan\\u201d by the British journalist Richard Balls, citing what she alleged was MacGowan\\u2019s continued substance abuse.\", \"MacGowan, who said he had not read the book (\\u201cI don\\u2019t do much reading anymore, and I\\u2019m certainly not going to read about myself\\u201d), took issue with O\\u2019Connor\\u2019s assessment. \\u201cWell, she\\u2019s dead wrong,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf there\\u2019s someone who wants a lot more of life, it\\u2019s me.\\u201d\", \"WHEN IT COMES to MacGowan\\u2019s life, it\\u2019s sometimes hard to separate legend from truth. By all accounts a bright child, he began drinking bottles of stout around age 5 and spent time in a psychiatric ward as a teenager. MacGowan became a London punk scenester, achieving his first blush of fame in 1976, when the British music paper NME ran a photograph of him bleeding from his ear under the headline \\u201cCannibalism at Clash Gig.\\u201d (A female companion apparently had bitten him.)\", \"In 1982, he co-founded Pogue Mahone, later shortened to the Pogues, a band that fused traditional Irish folk music with British punk rock. He recorded five studio albums with the band, most notably \\u201cRum Sodomy & the Lash\\u201d from 1985, produced by Elvis Costello, and \\u201cIf I Should Fall From Grace With God\\u201d from 1988, which features the group\\u2019s best-known song, \\u201cFairytale of New York.\\u201d\", \"Although admirers hailed MacGowan as a punk poet and the voice of the Irish diaspora, his considerable talents and keen intellect were often overshadowed by his hard partying and erratic behavior. While touring Japan in 1991, the Pogues \\u2014 unwilling to put up with the singer any longer \\u2014 fired MacGowan. The band dissolved in 1996, then reformed with MacGowan as frontman in 2001. The Pogues continued touring until 2014, when the group broke up again.\", \"MacGowan has taken steps toward self-improvement in recent years. In 2015, he underwent surgery to get a new set of teeth (the last of his originals had fallen out by 2008), a process documented in a British TV special called \\u201cShane MacGowan: A Wreck Reborn.\\u201d He\\u2019s still drinking \\u2014 during the interview, he took a few sips from a big glass of gin and tonic \\u2014 but not in the manner he used to. \\u201cMust be a couple of years since I\\u2019ve seen him drunk,\\u201d Clarke said. MacGowan no longer smokes cigarettes, but said he uses cannabis.\", \"At one point during the interview, the singer held up his drawing of a cyan one-eyed monster with horns, a snakelike tongue and an exposed penis. \\u201cThis is how you end up \\u2014 too many drugs,\\u201d he said, pointing at the picture. Asked if he related to the image, he replied, \\u201cNo, I don\\u2019t.\\u201d\", \"MacGowan has been drawing since he was a child, when he would get a new set of Faber-Castell colored pencils every Christmas, said his sister, Siobhan, a journalist-turned-novelist. Siobhan, 58, recalled family car rides from England to Tipperary, Ireland, where they spent summers and school holidays. \\u201cWe were both huddled under the same blanket, writing and drawing,\\u201d she said, \\u201cgoing into our own little cocoon.\\u201d\", \"The book\\u2019s punky drawings \\u2014 doodled on everything from hotel stationery to vomit bags \\u2014 date to the 1980s; most of them were recovered about two years ago from a black trash bag stored in Clarke\\u2019s mother\\u2019s attic. The 504-page hardcover, limited to 1,000 copies, is available for preorder now and due out in April. The least expensive version runs about $1,300.\", \"The book isn\\u2019t the only place where fans will be able to see MacGowan\\u2019s drawings. Recently, the Los Angeles luxury boutique Maxfield began selling cashmere items by the Swiss brand Frenckenberger that feature MacGowan\\u2019s artwork. (A blanket emblazoned with MacGowan\\u2019s drawing of a pair of leprechauns \\u2014 creatures MacGowan claimed to have seen in his youth \\u2014 retails for $14,145.) And the Dublin-based creative studio Algorithm is putting together a Shane MacGowan immersive art experience, akin to those dedicated to the work of Vincent van Gogh, with hopes that it will begin touring internationally next year.\", \"In an interview, Waldemar Januszczak, the art critic for The Sunday Times of London who wrote the introduction to \\u201cThe Eternal Buzz,\\u201d hailed the artwork\\u2019s \\u201cdemented, wild, fascinating, scabrous kind of energy.\\u201d He said he most admired MacGowan\\u2019s Catholic and sexual imagery, noting the \\u201cconstant fellatio\\u201d depicted in the book\\u2019s pages. \\u201cShane\\u2019s stuff doesn\\u2019t hold back at all,\\u201d Januszczak said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s right out there, full of his desires.\\u201d\", \"THE ARTWORK THAT brought up MacGowan\\u2019s most vivid recollection was his drawing of the New York City skyline. He related an incident that took place at the Manhattan nightclub the Limelight in the mid-1980s that involved the actor Matt Dillon (\\u201ca great guy,\\u201d he said) hitting on the Pogues bassist Cait O\\u2019Riordan: \\u201cShe was a big girl, and she ended up kicking him down the backstairs.\\u201d\", \"Clarke pointed out that there was a punchline to the story. \\u201cDid he say something really stupid like, \\u2018Is that a definite \\u2018no\\u2019?\\u2019?\\u201d MacGowan responded.\", \"Dillon went on to play a police officer in the music video for the Pogues\\u2019 \\u201cFairytale of New York,\\u201d a duet between MacGowan and the British singer-songwriter Kirsty MacColl, who died in a boating accident in 2000. The song is considered a Christmastime classic in the United Kingdom, but it is not without controversy. In 2020, BBC1 Radio announced it would play an edited version of the track that excised a gay slur and another pejorative.\", \"MacGowan, when asked about the perennial brouhaha surrounding the song, dismissed it as \\u201crubbish.\\u201d He has in the past argued that the slur, sung by MacColl, was an authentic representation of what her character might say.\", \"MacGowan hasn\\u2019t released a full studio album since \\u201cThe Crock of Gold\\u201d in 1997, which he recorded with the band the Popes. However, the singer has been working on an LP intermittently since 2015 with the Irish indie band Cronin. \\u201cOnce he\\u2019s in the studio, he\\u2019s all guns blazing,\\u201d said the band\\u2019s drummer, Mick Cronin, who added that MacGowan had last recorded with the group in May.\", \"Mick Cronin and his brother, Johnny, the band\\u2019s singer, guitarist and keyboardist, said in a joint interview that they\\u2019d completed 20 tracks with MacGowan, including covers of everything from Doris Day to vintage punk rock. Seven of the songs are originals, featuring old, previously unused lyrics by MacGowan.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s still punk, and it\\u2019s still Irish, and it still goes to the heart,\\u201d Johnny said of their collaborations. And what does the newer music sound like, according to MacGowan? \\u201cPretty much like the old music,\\u201d the singer said.\", \"It was unclear when the comeback album might be released. MacGowan expressed the desire to get back into the studio to record more material. \\u201cBut I can\\u2019t concentrate on that stuff,\\u201d he said, \\u201cwhen I can\\u2019t even walk across the room.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6b072afa67ef11eca79e8d5971bf0b49"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6b072afa67ef11eca79e8d5971bf0b49"}},
