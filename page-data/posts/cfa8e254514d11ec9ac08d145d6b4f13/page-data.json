Here are some of the events that led to the highly anticipated trial:\", \"Federal prosecutors accused Mr. Epstein of engaging in criminal sex acts with minors and women, some as young as 14.\", \"Mr. Epstein hanged himself in his jail cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center; he was not under suicide watch at the time of his death. He had just been denied bail on federal sex trafficking charges.\", \"Ms. Maxwell said in the lawsuit that Mr. Epstein and Darren Indyke, a longtime lawyer for Mr. Epstein and the executor of his estate, both promised to pay her legal fees, but she said they hadn\\u2019t. Her legal fees mounted as more women claimed she helped Mr. Epstein recruit them for sexual activity when they were underage.\", \"The indictment listed three minor victims who say they were recruited by Ms. Maxwell from 1994 to 1997 for criminal sexual activity.\", \"Her lawyers asked a federal judge in Manhattan to release her from jail on $5 million bond. Judge Alison J. Nathan of the Federal District Court in Manhattan denied the request after prosecutors argued that Ms. Maxwell posed a high risk of fleeing before her trial.\", \"Ms. Maxwell asked again to be released, this time on $28.5 million bond, arguing that the conditions of her Brooklyn jail were \\u201coppressive.\\u201d But once again the request was denied, after prosecutors said the probability she would flee was extremely high. Prosecutors also said the conditions in jail were reasonable, pointing to her personal shower, phone and two computers.\", \"A new indictment accuses Ms. Maxwell of grooming an additional minor. She is charged with sex trafficking a 14-year-old girl who engaged in sexual acts with Mr. Epstein at his Palm Beach, Fla., estate.\", \"Opening arguments are set for Monday.\"]","href_hash":"cfa8e254514d11ec9ac08d145d6b4f13"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cfa8e254514d11ec9ac08d145d6b4f13"}},
