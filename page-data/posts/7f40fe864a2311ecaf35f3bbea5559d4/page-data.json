Here\\u2019s a thought: Why not invite guest workers from Mexico?\", \"In general, I oppose guest worker programs because businesses misuse them to pay employees less than the prevailing wage. But a requirement that guest workers receive on average the same wages as American employees with similar experience and a limit on the number of guest workers could address that issue.\", \"Joshua P.

Instead of training teenagers to drive 18-wheelers or forcing retailers to increase their prices, it\\u2019s time to seriously consider how autonomous trucks can close links in the supply chain.\", \"To make up the 80,000-driver shortfall and alleviate the heavy toll on truck drivers, autonomous trucks are poised to be active partners within the ecosystem. Autonomous trucks aren\\u2019t restricted to a human driver\\u2019s schedule, so they can stay away from crowded urban areas during rush hour, and smoother driving can reduce fuel consumption by at least 10 percent. Envisioning a future with both autonomous and human-driven trucks, the Department of Transportation projects that autonomous trucks would increase spending across the U.S. economy by $111 billion over 30 years.\", \"It\\u2019s time for a shift in how Americans think about jobs and autonomous trucks. The two can exist together.\", \"Ariel WolfWashingtonThe writer is general counsel for the Self-Driving Coalition.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"The current truck driver shortage is rooted in sweatshop working conditions imposed by the trucking industry, not a lack of qualified drivers. Nonunion truck drivers, about 97 percent of all drivers, are exempt from a provision of our country\\u2019s most fundamental worker protection law, the Fair Labor Standards Act, that guarantees payment of overtime wages. They also are paid by the mile, not by the hour, which shamefully encourages speeding.\", \"Federal rules allow 11 hours of driving by truckers per day up to a total of 77 exhausting hours in a seven-day period, far in excess of the standard 40-hour week. Truck driving is one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States, risking the lives of truckers and all road users. Since 2009, truck crash fatalities have increased by 45 percent, causing about 5,000 deaths annually. No wonder there is huge turnover among drivers.\", \"The trucking industry\\u2019s solution of putting teens behind the wheel of 80,000-pound rigs reflects its pursuit of profits over public safety. A study found that truck drivers ages 19 to 20 are six times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than all truck drivers. This is a reckless proposal. What\\u2019s next?

Less polluting; savings on rebuilding our roads and bridges that trucks destroy quickly; eliminates road terrorism by huge trucks; less fuel use; etc., etc.\", \"Wake up, America and politicians!\", \"Peggy ConroyWest Chazy, N.Y.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"One of the deterrents to recruiting more truckers is, quite understandably, the lifestyle of being on the road for many days or even a few weeks at a time, with the attendant loneliness and isolation.\", \"Yes, we can try hiring more 18-year-olds, and allowing truckers to drive even more sleepy hours. But how about a trial of giving truckers some more life at home \\u2014 what I call the Short-Haul Trucking Model for Long-Haul Trucking?\", \"Instead of assigning a driver to go from, say, Los Angeles to Portland, Maine, and back, a trucking company would change the model: Driver No. 1 drives the first 1,000 miles of the trip in two days. He is replaced by a fresh Driver No. 2, who lives in the changeover city. Driver No. 2 drives two days to the next changeover city. A third fresh driver gets the truck to Maine. Meanwhile, each driver takes a different truck back to his home city.\", \"Each driver is away from home only three nights. He drives two days out, then two days back, then gets a few days off. More humane.\", \"It probably wouldn\\u2019t work for small trucking companies. But with a lot of planning, the big companies should be able to work out the scheduling.

A way to grow the field of truckers is recruiting and retaining more women drivers. A report by Time\\u2019sUp Foundation and the Institute for Women\\u2019s Policy Research shows that sexual harassment can flourish in isolated, male-dominated fields such as trucking, pushing women out of the industry or discouraging them from joining in the first place.\", \"This is costly both to women themselves \\u2014 our research shows sexual harassment can cost women as much as $1.3 million during their lifetime \\u2014 and the economy overall.
