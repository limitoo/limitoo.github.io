There was a large police presence Friday morning in the village of Massapequa Park.\", \"Heuermann was expected to appear in court later Friday and authorities were scheduled to hold a news conference at 4 p.m. ET.\", \"The major development comes more than a decade after the discovery of at least 10 women whose bodies were found on Long Island's Gilgo Beach.
