But governments around the world are losing patience with people who have decided not to get inoculated\\u2014and some are imposing mandates in efforts to save thousands of lives and avoid disastrous new waves of infection.\", \"This figure does not include countries such as the U.S., which have introduced compulsory vaccination for some workers and public officials but not for the rest of the population. The calculation only includes countries that have enacted mandates for their whole adult population.\", \"On November 23, Austria became the first Western democracy and European Union member state to announce restrictions, saying vaccination would be compulsory from February 1. The government in Vienna has not yet made it clear what penalties it will impose on people who flout the rules.\", \"According to World Population Review, some 7.47 million adults could be affected by the mandate. The move came days after Austria reintroduced lockdown for unvaccinated people. As of December 2, 70 percent of the population had received at least one dose, while 66 percent was fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data.\", \"Turkmenistan made vaccination compulsory for all eligible adults in July, except those with certain medical conditions.

On the same day, Europe's biggest economy recorded 73,279 new cases and 390 additional deaths. It set a record for daily new cases on November 24, with 79,051.\", \"The president of the European Union, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Thursday it was time for member states to consider mandatory vaccinations. The surge of cases across the 27-nation bloc has already led many governments to reintroduce restrictions and mask mandates. As of December 2, 67 percent of the EU's population is fully vaccinated, not a high enough proportion to contain COVID-19.\", \"Last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said his country's COVID-19 task team was discussing a mandatory vaccine policy.\", \"One EU member, Slovakia, is considering a different approach\\u2014paying adults 500 euros ($567) to get vaccinated.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944879/covid-screening.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A health official picks up a specimen storage vial while conducting COVID-19 screening of passengers at a railway station in Bangalore, southern India, on December 3.
