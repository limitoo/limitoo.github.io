In defence, Anna Green returned to the side for the first time since the Olympics. She joined Ali Riley, Katie Bowen and Claudia Bunge, fresh off her second A-League Women title win with Melbourne Victory. Hannah Wilkinson led the line supported by Paige Satchell and Liv Chance with Ria Percival, Daisy Cleverley and Betsy Hassett in midfield.\", \"The opening moments saw the Matildas dominate possession. In a hint of what was to come, the 10th minute saw Vic Esson pull off a brilliant save, clawing away a Clare Polkinghorne header to deny a certain goal and to keep it 0-0.\", \"The 15th minute saw a major setback. Ria Percival went down uncontested holding her knee and had to be helped off the pitch by Ali Riley and Katie Bowen. Meikayla Moore came on to replace her moving Katie Bowen into midfield. Hopefully the injury isn't as serious as it first appeared.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/291157/eight_col_down.jpg?1649436664\\\" alt=\\\"An injured Ria Percival of New Zealand is consoled.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nAn injured Ria Percival \\nPhoto: PHOTOSPORT\\n</div>\", \"What happened in the 31st minute will be replayed endlessly. Meikayla Moore played a ball down the wing to Anna Green who looked up to see Matildas keeper Lydia Williams off her line. From an extremely tight angle Green took her chance, lobbing the Matildas keeper to score a brilliant opener against the shocked Australians.\", \"The Matildas continued to press but to no avail as the Ferns took their 1-0 lead into the break.\", \"For the second 45, head coach Jitka Klimkov\\u00e1 introduced Gabi Rennie and Liz Anton, replacing Anna Green and Betsy Hassett, to add fresh legs to cope with the draining Queensland conditions.\", \"Australia picked up where they left off, dominating possession and chances but continually being denied by Vic Esson and Claudia Bunge, who put in an outstanding performance in defence.\", \"Chance after chance was blocked by the Ferns as clock ticked over the 90 minute mark with them in the lead.\", \"On 90' +4 the Matildas finally found a way through. An Ellie Carpenter cutback found Emily van Egmond around the penalty spot who finally found a way past Vic Esson to equalise.
