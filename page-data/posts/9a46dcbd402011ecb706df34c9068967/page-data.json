This created a \\\"human crush\\\" scenario and resulted in numerous attendees getting trampled. Some witnesses alleged that Scott encouraged the audience to get closer to the stage prior to the incident. Scott has, in general, been accused of frequently encouraging chaotic and dangerous behavior at his shows.\", \"Multiple videos have also emerged from the night, showing attendees pleading with security to stop the show and sections of the audience chanting for the performance to stop. Videos of other artists, including Linkin Park, stopping their shows to address crowd safety have also gone viral in the wake of the Astroworld incident.\", \"\\\"My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted by what happened at Astroworld Festival,\\\" Scott wrote in a tweet about the incident. \\\"Houston PD has my total support as they continue to look into the tragic loss of life. I am committed to working together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need. Thank you to Houston PD, Fire Department and NRG Park for their immediate response and support. Love you all.\\\"\", \"Kylie Jenner, Scott's partner, also released a statement sharing support for the victims while also insisting that the rapper was not aware of the incident while he was performing.\", \"\\\"Travis and I are broken and devastated,\\\" Jenner wrote on Instagram. \\\"My thoughts and prayers are with all who lost their lives, were injured or affected in any way by yesterday's events. And also for Travis who I know cares deeply about his fans and the Houston community. I want to make it clear we weren't aware of any fatalities until the news came out after the show and in no world would have continued filming or performing. I am sending my deepest condolences to all the families during this difficult time and will be praying for the healing of everyone who has been impacted.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"9a46dcbd402011ecb706df34c9068967"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9a46dcbd402011ecb706df34c9068967"}},
