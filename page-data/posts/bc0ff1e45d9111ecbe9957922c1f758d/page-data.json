The containers would then be transported on lightweight trailers, preferably hauled by electric vehicles, to drop-off points around Manhattan. From there delivery companies will distribute the packages using battery-powered handcarts or cargo bicycles.\", \"The idea of using the waterfront for cargo is hardly new. Manhattan was once a thriving global port of entry for cargo like cotton, iron or grain. But in the last century waterborne cargo has all but disappeared, replaced by fleets of trucks and vans crawling over the bridges and through the tunnels that connect Manhattan with other parts of the region.\", \"The need to reduce climate-changing emissions and congestion from delivery trucks has become more urgent during the coronavirus pandemic. Traffic has soared in New York City with a boom in e-commerce that has put more trucks on the roads and increasingly sent them into residential neighborhoods.\", \"Truck traffic at six major crossings to New York City from New Jersey \\u2014 including the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels \\u2014 rose to 638,725 trucks in September, up from 620,150 trucks in the same month in 2019, before the pandemic, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the crossings.\", \"The plan being pushed in New York is modeled after similar programs elsewhere, including in Dublin, where it was developed by Fernhay in partnership with UPS, the package delivery giant.\", \"UPS vans take packages to so-called microdistribution centers near central Dublin. Narrow four-wheeled Fernhay vehicles known as eQuads, powered by a combination of batteries and human pedal power, take packages to their destinations.\", \"The Dublin system accounts for a relatively small proportion of deliveries there, said Colm Ennis, senior executive engineer in the city\\u2019s Environment and Transportation Department.\", \"\\u201cIt hasn\\u2019t been a game changer,\\u201d Mr. Ennis said. But he added that any reduction in traffic was welcome and that the Fernhay system was putting pressure on UPS rivals to reduce their contributions to traffic and emissions.\", \"\\u201cWhere it is having a bigger impact is making the other companies think about what they\\u2019re doing,\\u201d Mr. Ennis said.\", \"UPS, which has promised to reduce its net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero by 2050, already uses bicycles extensively in Europe. In Munich, for example, most deliveries in the center city are made by bikes, said Peter Harris, vice president for international sustainability at UPS.\", \"But he said that most of the cargo bikes available today were not rugged enough for UPS, prompting the company to work with Fernhay to develop vehicles suited to its needs.\", \"The eQuads, as well as battery-powered handcarts that can travel on sidewalks, are made to carry a standardized box holding numerous packages. The boxes are loaded in central distribution hubs, reducing the amount of handling a toaster oven or loungewear set requires to reach its city center customer. They are a scaled-down version of the containers that have been used for decades to move international cargo.\", \"\\u201cShipping containers revolutionized the shipping industry a number of years ago,\\u201d Mr. Harris said. \\u201cThe smaller containers we are talking about here could revolutionize city logistics.\\u201d\", \"In New York, the plan is for a dedicated NY Waterway ferry to bring loaded containers from freight terminals in Bayonne, N.J., and Red Hook in Brooklyn to the Downtown Manhattan Heliport. Mr. Wachtel, founding partner of Wachtel Missry, a Manhattan firm, is chairman of Saker Aviation, which operates the Downtown Manhattan Heliport. He is also an investor in Fernhay.\", \"At the heliport, the mini-containers will be loaded on trailers and taken to locations around the city, where they will be transferred to battery-powered handcarts for delivery. The eQuad bikes will be used sparingly in New York, said Robin Haycock, a veteran automotive engineer who is a co-founder of Fernhay. \\u201cManhattan lends itself more to walkers,\\u201d he said.\", \"Fernhay and Mr. Wachtel are not seeking public money to finance the project, and only routine municipal approvals will be needed to begin operating, he said. While UPS looks favorably on the project, it has stopped short of making a commitment.\", \"\\u201cWe are exploring the feasibility of taking this model from European cities to the U.S.,\\u201d Lauren Spangler, a UPS spokeswoman, said by email.\", \"The partners hope to attract other customers like FedEx, Amazon and Ikea. To convert the heliport to receive ferries, Mr. Wachtel said, \\u201call you do is float in a barge.\\u201d\", \"The freight-by-ferry plan comes as city officials are expected to announce a renewed effort to reduce the city\\u2019s reliance on truck traffic and promote a more sustainable freight delivery system at a news conference at Pier 79 in Manhattan on Wednesday afternoon.\", \"By 2045, the total volume of freight moving through New York City has been projected to hit 540 million tons a year, up from 365 million tons today \\u2014 most of which is carried on trucks \\u2014 according to transportation experts.\", \"In response, city officials have taken steps such as promoting off-hour truck deliveries, expanding neighborhood loading zones and working with e-commerce and shipping companies, including Amazon and DHL, to use cargo bikes as an alternative to delivery trucks.\", \"The city\\u2019s growing truck traffic has made its streets less safe for pedestrians and cyclists and worsened congestion and pollution, said Sarah M. Kaufman, the associate director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University.\", \"Turning to ferries as an alternative, Ms. Kaufman said, was a smart, multipronged approach to addressing a truck problem that was only going to get worse as people continue to shop online even after the pandemic ends.\", \"\\u201cManhattan is an island and we don\\u2019t make adequate use of our waterfront,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIf we can reduce traffic on the street and make more productive use of our waterways, we\\u2019ll see a slew of benefits.\\u201d\", \"Manhattan\\u2019s thriving population and factories helped transform its waterfront into a center for shipping, trade and commerce in the 1800s and early 1900s, said Kurt C. Schlichting, a sociology professor at Fairfield University and author of the 2018 book \\u201cWaterfront Manhattan.\\u201d\", \"Ships carried machinery and iron and steel from England to build railroads, sugar cane from the Caribbean and cotton from the American South.\", \"But Professor Schlichting added that this once-bustling waterfront later languished in part because trucks started moving cargo on highways and Manhattan\\u2019s crowded docks and streets were ill suited for the industry\\u2019s shift to container shipping, which offered a more efficient way to move cargo in large metal boxes.\", \"Professor Schlichting said he liked the idea of bringing freight back to the Manhattan waterfront, but he questioned how practical it would be to ship large volumes of freight to a waterfront that is crowded today with recreational users.\", \"\\u201cTo repurpose the waterfront another time for the delivery of freight, I think it would be hard to keep up with the scale \\u2014 in other words, all the packages,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"bc0ff1e45d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bc0ff1e45d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}},
