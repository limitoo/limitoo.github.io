She graduated from the University of Washington and received a master\\u2019s degree in public policy from the Paris Institute of Political Studies.\", \"She will succeed David Berliner, who has served since 2016 and started as a member of the museum\\u2019s board in 2011. The position was established with Berliner\\u2019s appointment; the museum previously only had a board president.\", \"In a telephone interview, Trueblood said she was \\u201cthrilled\\u201d to be joining an institution \\u201cthat can be part of a conversation, that can help move civic society forward.\\u201d\", \"At a time when the cultural world is trying to correct for the absence of people of color in leadership positions, some may question the museum\\u2019s selection of Trueblood, who is white. After hiring a white African art consulting curator in 2018, the institution was accused by one activist group of perpetuating \\u201congoing legacies of oppression.\\u201d\", \"Pasternak noted that the museum had recently restructured its leadership team to include a more diverse group of deputy directors and that the search process had been broad and thorough \\u2014 aided by the recruiting firm Isaacson, Miller. Pasternak added that it was \\u201cimportant to have women in leadership\\u201d and that Trueblood\\u2019s experience had prepared her well to lead an ambitious capital effort that will coincide with the museum\\u2019s celebration of its 200th anniversary.\", \"Trueblood, 38, a Brooklyn resident, said she was committed to \\u201cmaking sure the next 200 years are even more inclusive than the last 200.\\u201d\", \"The second-largest museum in New York after the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum has long struggled with financial pressures. Last year, it became the first major U.S. arts organization to take advantage of a two-year window in which the Association of Art Museum Directors allowed institutions hit hard by the economic crisis to deaccession, or sell off, work to help pay for collection care.\", \"With such sales, Pasternak said the museum has succeeded in establishing a $40 million fund that can generate $2 million a year for care. Its permanent collection of more than 500,000 objects includes one of the world\\u2019s leading collections of Egyptian art.\"]","href_hash":"f4f1559e584811ec89f497f9aa3641ea"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f4f1559e584811ec89f497f9aa3641ea"}},
