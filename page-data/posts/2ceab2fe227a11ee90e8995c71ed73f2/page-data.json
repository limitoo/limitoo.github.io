Under the 1965 Higher Education Act and federal regulations, a borrower is eligible for loan forgiveness after making 240 or 300 qualifying monthly payments \\u2014 roughly 20 or 25 years of payments \\u2014 on an income-driven repayment plan or standard repayment plan. The administration said \\\"inaccurate payment counts\\\" caused borrowers to lose \\\"hard-earned progress\\\" toward having their loans forgiven, which it has sought to remedy.\", \"Loans covered include Direct Loans or Federal Family Education Loans held by the Department of Education, including Parent PLUS Loans.\", \"The latest announcement from the Department of Education is part of the Biden administration's efforts to provide relief to Americans with student loan debt, and is different from the program struck down by the Supreme Court late last month.\", \"Under that plan, which the court's conservative majority said is unlawful, eligibility depended on income. Borrowers earning up to $125,000 annually could have up to $10,000 in student debt forgiven. Qualifying Pell Grant recipients, students with the greatest financial need, who met the income threshold could have had up to an additional $10,000 in relief.\", \"That plan by the Biden administration was far more sweeping, with an estimated 40 million Americans eligible for relief, 20 million of whom would have had their loan balances erased.\\u00a0\", \"The program also relied on a different law \\u2014 the HEROES Act \\u2014 than the loan discharges announced Friday. The HEROES Act authorizes the education secretary to \\\"waive or modify\\\" student financial assistance programs for borrowers \\\"in connection\\\" with a national emergency, such as the pandemic.\\u00a0\", \"But the Supreme Court disagreed, finding the administration overstepped its authority with its plan to erase $430 billion in student debt.\", \"The court also invoked the so-called \\\"major questions\\\" doctrine in part of its ruling, a legal theory that holds there must be clear congressional authorization for an executive branch agency to decide an issue of \\\"vast economic or political significance.\\\"\", \"The \\\"economic and political significance\\\" of the loan forgiveness plan, Roberts wrote, \\\"is staggering by any measure.\\\" The court ruled that the education secretary could modify \\\"existing statutory or regulatory provisions\\\" under the Education Act, but \\\"not to rewrite that statute from the ground up.\\\"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"2ceab2fe227a11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2ceab2fe227a11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
