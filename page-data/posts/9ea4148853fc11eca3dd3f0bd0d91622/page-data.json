like her on TV, and as she grew up that became her motivation for change.\\u00a0\", \"Ms Diviney, now aged 22, had a love of storytelling as a child and a unique perspective born of her love for the written word and media.\", \"\\\"The main thing that I want is for disabled kids to see themselves as the heroes of their own stories and to have control over their own narratives because that doesn't happen very often, [and to] see themselves having friends, falling in love, and having adventures,\\\" she said.\", \"Now she is trying to change the way the world sees Disney animation through a petition that has gained tens of thousands of signatures and growing recognition from the likes of Hollywood actor\\u00a0Reese Witherspoon.\", \"As Ms Diviney grew up, she continued to realise the power of storytelling and how stories shaped people.\", \"When she was four years old, she created a small book titled Christmas at Arndu\\u00a0named after her pre-school where the book was set.\",

smoking ad \\u2014\\u00a0something where it becomes very clear that the life-altering thing means that life is 'over'.\\\"\", \"The Wollongong University graduate disliked the negative message that
