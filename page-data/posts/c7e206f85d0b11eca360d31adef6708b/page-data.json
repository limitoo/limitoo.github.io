She welcomed the crowd with an interested smile, and explained that the music that evening would be \\u201cdedicated to distance.\\u201d After the set she spoke again, saying that throughout it she had been meditating on the feeling of \\u201cnever being close enough.\\u201d\", \"The first 20 minutes were played only in duet with the pedal steel guitarist Susan Alcorn, and they were probably the most affecting part. The musicians weren\\u2019t heavy-handed about the set\\u2019s theme, but about 15 minutes in, after a hefty silence, Ortman played a few sharp, playful curlicues on the violin and Alcorn responded with a restive note held in the lower register. They carried on like this for about a minute, and the tension was noticeable from below: two communicators, stuck at opposite ends of multiple spectra at once \\u2014 melody/drone, high/low, rhythmic/unfixed \\u2014 finding a way to direct and follow at the same time.\", \"Throughout 2021, I often got the most out of records made by duos, which allowed me to hear musicians not just collaborating but conversing directly. It likely wasn\\u2019t just the pandemic that brought me there, or that led to so many great duet recordings this year: We\\u2019ve been tunneling toward mutually assured isolation for a long time, embracing a digital existence that has reorganized, among other things, how we talk to each other and how we make music.\", \"The pair of electromagnetic, almost sensual albums released by the saxophonist Sam Gendel and the bassist Sam Wilkes seem to be having an intimate conversation with this moment. They recorded \\u201cMusic for Saxofone & Bass Guitar,\\u201d released in 2018, and its follow-up, \\u201cMusic for Saxofone & Bass Guitar More Songs,\\u201d out this year, live to tape during a series of casual performances outside restaurants in Los Angeles, with each musician manning a setup of loops, effects and other manipulators. They hardly sound like live albums, but they\\u2019re not studio recordings either.\", \"\\u201cHonestly, it\\u2019s an extension of hanging out and connecting on some stuff and then saying, \\u2018Oh, let\\u2019s jam,\\u2019\\u201d Gendel said in a video interview with Wilkes last week. \\u201cThen after we jammed, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Oh, let\\u2019s move the jam down the street and play in front of some people, low-key, just unannounced.\\u2019\\u201d Some members of their impromptu audience were transfixed; others, they said, carried on eating and chatting.\", \"It works: Gendel and Wilkes seem so intently focused on each other, they might not need an audience. But there\\u2019s plenty of room for your ears, if you tap into the space they\\u2019ve created.\", \"Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, a pair of hip-hop producers with Hall of Fame r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9s, teamed up a few years ago with a shared goal: to challenge themselves to take their chops up a notch, not just as producers but as instrumentalists.\", \"\\u201cThat became the aspiration \\u2014 to go beyond just sampling, to really understand, like, Man, what were they thinking about when they played this?\\u201d Muhammad said in a video interview, referring to the jazz musicians whose recordings he has sampled so heavily from, as a member of A Tribe Called Quest and after.\", \"Younge and Muhammad invited some of their \\u201970s jazz heroes \\u2014 Roy Ayers, Brian Jackson, Gary Bartz \\u2014 into the studio, and recorded a series of short albums through a process that was heavily improvised. They\\u2019ve been releasing those records throughout the pandemic on their own label, Jazz Is Dead. Loose and vernacular and charged with reverence, these LPs have the ambient feeling of a studio outtake from a recording session that never happened, caught somewhere in the airspace between 50 years ago and today.\", \"Unlikely cross-generational collaborations bore rich fruit in other realms of the jazz world this year, too. In the spring, the pianist Jason Moran self-released an arresting duet performance he\\u2019d given at the Big Ears Festival in 2019, alongside the drummer and polymath Milford Graves. The young vocalist Nick Hakim and the elder saxophonist Roy Nathanson created a tender and playful album, \\u201cSmall Things,\\u201d in Nathanson\\u2019s basement in early 2020. The eminent jazz saxophonist Pharoah Sanders teamed up with the electronic musician and composer Floating Points, n\\u00e9 Sam Shepherd, to record \\u201cPromises,\\u201d which both expanded and cooled down each musician\\u2019s natural aesthetics. It landed at the top of many critics\\u2019 best-of-2021 lists, including mine.\", \"The duet has a long and fertile history in jazz, though in the course of an artist\\u2019s career it\\u2019s usually seen as a detour, not a main road. Even Louis Armstrong, jazz\\u2019s first great soloist, made some of his finest early recordings in duet with the pianist Earl Hines; ever since, the format has offered listeners a close perspective into both the playing and the listening of jazz\\u2019s great improvisers. And from the 1960s it has been a preferred format on the avant-garde, where free-form improvising can really reward a smaller format. When Graves, who died this year, was in his 20s and already well into a Promethean career, his duet with the piano titan Don Pullen became a vehicle for artistic innovation, economic self-determination (through their collaborative label) and political visioning.\", \"Sylvie Courvoisier and Mary Halvorson are contemporary improvisers who approach abstraction from two different angles: Courvoisier as a pianist at the bridge between free jazz and European classical music, and Halvorson as a deconstructive guitar improviser, strongly affiliated with (for lack of a better term) the Brooklyn jazz scene. Their second duo album, \\u201cSearching for the Disappeared Hour,\\u201d was a chance to mine the jazz canon for inspiration while finding ways to playfully disrupt each other\\u2019s style.\", \"They re-listened closely to \\u201cUndercurrent,\\u201d the famed album of duets by the guitarist Jim Hall and the pianist Bill Evans, and sought to create something with a similar quality of attentive mystery. Courvoisier and Halvorson each contributed about half the compositions on \\u201cDisappeared Hour,\\u201d and each one wrote with the other player in mind. Then, once the pieces were written, the other musician went in and tinkered with them.\", \"\\u201cI love her melodies: She has this typical Mary sound, a very unique way of writing,\\u201d Courvoisier said in an interview. \\u201cSometimes I\\u2019d ask her, \\u2018Can I reharmonize that one?\\u2019 She said, \\u2018Sure.\\u2019\\u201d This worked in both directions. \\u201cShe does the same with my songs,\\u201d Courvoisier said. \\u201cShe\\u2019ll hear me and say, \\u2018Can I bend that note?\\u2019 I\\u2019ll say, \\u2018Great.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"When improvised music comes wild and untethered, as theirs often does, some listeners lose their bearings. But when someone says they\\u2019re not sure how to engage with music like this, I suggest listening to it simply as a feeling, not as a bunch of strategies or linguistic parts. In duo scenarios, it\\u2019s especially easy to listen that way, mostly because that\\u2019s how each player is hearing the other: through feeling.\", \"Sara Schoenbeck is one of the few improvising bassoonists of her pedigree, but she rarely makes music as a leader. When she decided a few years ago to make an album under her name, a duet format made sense: Hers is a quiet, unwieldy instrument; playing in duos allows her \\u201cnot to have to stress about using amplification, or not have to change the way that I would naturally want to play,\\u201d she said in an interview.\", \"The self-titled album that she released last month consists of nine duets, each with a different musical partner; including original compositions, open-ended improvisations and one cover of a tune by the slowcore band Low, each track is arresting in a different way. One of the quietest \\u2014 and the one that most rewards careful listening \\u2014 features the saxophonist and avant-garde eminence Roscoe Mitchell. Playing with him, Schoenbeck said, made her think about patience. It was a reminder that the way to show someone you\\u2019ve heard them isn\\u2019t always to respond.\", \"She said she\\u2019d challenged herself with this question: \\u201cHow much can you start from a small idea, and not move too quickly?\\u201d And Mitchell, she said, is \\u201ckind of a master at that.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhen you\\u2019re performing, your endorphins change; your idea of time and space changes, and it\\u2019s really easy to move too quickly,\\u201d Schoenbeck added. \\u201cSo that\\u2019s something I\\u2019ve come back to: How do you not move too quickly, how do you stay in a space, how do you gradually change the language that\\u2019s happening? It\\u2019s hard.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c7e206f85d0b11eca360d31adef6708b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c7e206f85d0b11eca360d31adef6708b"}},
