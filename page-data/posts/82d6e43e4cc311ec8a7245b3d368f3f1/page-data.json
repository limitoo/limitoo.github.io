This includes numerous breakfast cereals, as well as yogurt and dry pasta.\", \"Dollar Store, one of the United States' largest bargain chains, also announced that it is raising its baseline price from one dollar to $1.25 for items across its stores. The CEO of the company stated that the issues with the supply chain were the largest factor in this decision.\", \"Economic inflation seems to have become a major issue for the public, and GOP leaders continue to press Biden on the issue.
