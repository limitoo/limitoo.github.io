Johnson says, in what is the\\u00a0first publicly confirmed death globally from the swiftly spreading strain.\", \"Since the first Omicron cases were detected on November\\u00a027 in Britain, Mr Johnson has imposed tougher restrictions and has cautioned that the variant could overcome the immune defences of those inoculated with two shots of vaccines.\", \"Britain gave no details on the death other than the person had been diagnosed in hospital.\", \"It was not clear if the patient had been vaccinated or had underlying health issues.\", \"Deaths from Omicron may have occurred in other countries but none has been publicly confirmed yet outside Britain.\", \"\\\"Sadly at least one patient has now been confirmed to have died with Omicron,\\\" Mr Johnson told reporters at a vaccination centre in London.\", \"\\\"So I think the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus \\u2014 I think that's something we need to set [to]\\u00a0one side\\u00a0\\u2014 and just recognise the sheer pace at which it accelerates through the population.\\\"\", \"UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the variant now accounted for 44 per cent\\u00a0of infections in London and would be the dominant strain in the capital within 48 hours.\", \"New Omicron infections are estimated at 200,000 per day, Mr Javid said.\", \"Before the death was announced, Britain said 10 people had been hospitalised with Omicron in various parts of England.\", \"Their ages ranged from 18 to 85 years and most had received two vaccination doses.\", \"The UK Health Security Agency said Omicron \\u2014 first detected in South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong in late November \\u2014 can overcome the immunity of those who have had two shots of vaccines such as AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech.\", \"South Africa's health ministry said it was unable to say with certainty if any of its COVID-19 deaths were caused by Omicron as deaths were not broken down by variant.\", \"<img

possible.(AP: Victoria Jones/PA)</div>\", \"The World Health Organization said on Sunday that while preliminary findings from South Africa suggest Omicron may be less severe than the Delta variant \\u2014 currently dominant worldwide, and all cases reported in the Europe region have been mild or asymptomatic, it remains unclear to what extent Omicron may be inherently less virulent.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Reimposed restrictions amid booster surge</div>\", \"In a televised announcement on Sunday night (local time), Mr\\u00a0Johnson said everyone 18 and up would be offered a third vaccine dose by December 31 \\u2014\\u00a0less than three weeks away, and a month earlier than the previous target.\", \"Mr Johnson said boosters would \\\"reinforce our wall of vaccine protection\\\"

Monday.\\u00a0\", \"At St\\u00a0Thomas' Hospital, on the south bank of the River Thames in London, the lines of people waiting for booster shots stretched across Westminster Bridge toward Parliament.\", \"At the Gordon Hospital walk-in clinic in central London, most of those lining up were in their 20s and 30s.\", \"<img

just had a baby and she's not vaccinated, so if I can be extra vaccinated, then that will help,\\\" he said.\", \"The government's appointment-booking website struggled to keep up with demand, and also ran out of rapid at-home virus test kits, which have been distributed free to households during the pandemic.\", \"While Omicron is spreading around the world, Britain may be especially affected because it ordinarily has high levels of travel to South Africa.\", \"The Omicron outbreak is also more visible in Britain because the UK\\u00a0is also a world leader in genomic sequencing, which identifies and tracks new variants.\", \"Researchers in the UK have sequenced about 13.3 per cent\\u00a0of all positive cases, compared with 3.8 per cent in the US, according to GISAID, which promotes rapid sharing of data on COVID-19 and the flu.\", \"While Iceland and Denmark have sequenced a greater percentage of their positive cases, the size of the UK's population and the scope of its outbreak mean that Britain has sequenced many more cases.\", \"This surveillance provided key evidence that Mr Johnson and his chief medical officers used in deciding to tighten pandemic restrictions and ramp up the UK's vaccination program.\", \"The government is requiring vaccine certificates to enter nightclubs and reintroducing restrictions that were lifted almost six months ago.\", \"Masks must be worn again in most indoor settings and people have been urged to work from home if possible.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5ab05f4d0be1537481d161dcda831b61\\\"
