By 2001, when Britain\\u2019s art scene seemed like the coolest in the world, a prime time audience was tuning in to watch Madonna give out the prize on live television.\", \"Now the prize is a much less buzzy affair, perhaps because the public here is less easily shocked by contemporary art. Where once the tabloid press fulminated against the prize\\u2019s nominees, these days much art world discussion takes place in more specialized publications and on social media.\", \"For most of its life, the Turner Prize was a battle between individual artists \\u2014 or occasionally a duo, like Gilbert and George, who won in 1986 \\u2014 from a shortlist of four nominees, chosen by a jury in recognition of an outstanding recent show.\", \"But for three years now, there has been no single winner. In 2019, the four finalists rebelled against the rules and, in a surprise announcement at the award ceremony, said they would share the honor and 40,000 pounds in prize money, around $54,000, equally. The following year, after coronavirus lockdowns in Britain shuttered most exhibitions in the country for months, the Tate museum group, which organizes the prize, canceled the award and instead distributed \\u00a3100,000 as grants among 10 artists.\", \"This year, the judges also decided against anointing a lone figure: The winner, which will be announced in a ceremony on Dec. 1, will be drawn from a shortlist of five collectives, each of whose work has as much to do with social activism as art. The groups\\u2019 aims range from developing more climate-friendly eating habits to building solidarity among queer people of color through organizing club nights and workshops.\", \"The nomination of these collectives underlines the quandary for the Turner Prize today: Is its role to capture the zeitgeist, or to reward excellence?\", \"In an interview, Alex Farquharson, the Tate official who selects and oversees the Turner Prize\\u2019s four-person jury, insisted that the award was still relevant, whatever its role. \\u201cThe very fact that the Turner Prize can divide critical opinion, I think, reflects the fact that there is actually a lot of interest,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt attracts that commentary, it attracts that engagement.\\u201d\", \"Yet there is no question that there is less interest than in the 1990s and early 2000s, when the winners\\u2019 list was virtually a roll call of the \\u201cYoung British Artists,\\u201d or Y.B.A.s, an entrepreneurial group, spearheaded by Damien Hirst, who upended London\\u2019s elitist art scene by staging their own shows in alternative spaces. Some of those artists\\u2019 greatest hits include pickled animals, sex dolls and an unmade bed.\", \"Back then, a group of figurative painters calling themselves the Stuckists would gather regularly on the steps of the Tate Gallery to demonstrate against the conceptual art on show inside; in the Stuckists\\u2019 eyes, those works weren\\u2019t art at all. But over the years, the scandalous offerings of the Y.B.A. generation have been assimilated into the artistic mainstream, and might even seem old-fashioned now.\", \"The shortlists from the prize\\u2019s early days were dominated by white men, an imbalance that has only recently started to be redressed. The Black British artists Chris Ofili and Steve McQueen scooped up the award in 1998 and 1999, but it took 18 more years for another Black person to win, when Lubaina Himid became the first Black female winner, in 2017.\", \"The jury\\u2019s decision to shortlist only socially engaged collectives prompted complaints that it is putting politics over aesthetics. In an interview, Jake Chapman, one half of the Chapman Brothers duo that was nominated in 2003, said that a lot of art these days served a \\u201cvery defined and performative sense of social responsibility,\\u201d limiting its ability to be experimental and open-ended.\", \"\\u201cThe explosive, neoliberal individualism of the Young British Artists has given way to the notion of art serving a social purpose,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m just wondering at what point will it merge with Social Services.\\u201d\", \"And it\\u2019s not just social engagement in vogue among artists right now; collectives are also taking some of the art world\\u2019s highest honors. The Indonesian artist group ruangrupa, for example, will oversee the 2022 edition of the Documenta mega-exhibition, a once-every-five-years event regarded as the most important statement about the direction of contemporary art.\", \"The work of the Turner Prize\\u2019s nominated collectives is on show this year at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry, England, as part of a drive by Tate to broaden engagement outside London. The exhibition, which runs through Jan. 12, 2022, includes a recreation of a cozy pub adorned with hand-sewn protest banners, created by the Belfast-based group Array, which champions human rights through carnivalesque civic actions; a working studio run by the group Project Art Works, in which \\u201cneurodivergent\\u201d members of that collective are making art throughout the exhibition\\u2019s run; and films by Gentle/Radical, a community of artists, faith ministers, youth workers and activists.\", \"Cooking Sections, another nominee, is presenting an audiovisual installation about the negative environmental effects of intensive salmon farming. Those artists, whose practice investigates the political systems behind the food we eat, have persuaded many museums \\u2014 including the Herbert, where the show is taking place \\u2014 to take salmon off their cafe menus as part of their project, \\u201cClimavore.\\u201d\", \"There\\u2019s also an immersive nightclub-like installation by B.O.S.S., a group of Black queer, trans and nonbinary people who build sound systems and organize D.J. sets, performances and other events.\", \"Anish Kapoor, who won the award in 1991, said in an interview that he welcomed the Turner Prize\\u2019s political turn in the context of an art world \\u201cobsessed with money.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI dare to think of it as an anticapitalist move in miniature,\\u201d Kapoor said, adding that all the nominees were \\u201cvery clear that theirs is a social agenda, that art can make deep and real psychic change.\\u201d\", \"Such arguments ring hollow to the Turner Prize\\u2019s long-term critics. Michael Sandle, a self-described \\u201cradical traditionalist\\u201d who has never been nominated for the award, said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s all well and good having these views, which are probably genuine \\u2014 but where is the bloody art?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s what I want to see, expressed powerfully through an artist,\\u201d he said: The prize\\u2019s organizers should stop trying to \\u201cget on any fashionable bandwagon.\\u201d\", \"But artists working together isn\\u2019t such a break with the past, said Iwona Blazwick, the artistic director of the Whitechapel Gallery, a London museum. \\u201cOne hundred years ago, the avant-garde was defined by groups,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThe jury was absolutely correct in recognizing that this is a very powerful, artistic impulse. It doesn\\u2019t mean that we will never see a prize for painting or a single practitioner.\\u201d\", \"Even some of the nominated artists, however, have criticized Tate for trying to boost its credibility by embracing social justice trends. Just days after B.O.S.S.\\u2019s nomination was announced, in May, the group posted a message on Instagram accusing arts institutions of \\u201cexploitative practices in prize culture.\\u201d The statement added that, for award organizers, \\u201cBlack, brown, working class, disabled, queer bodies are desirable, quickly dispensable, but never sustainably cared for.\\u201d\", \"Those concerns are shared by other emerging artists, including Larry Achiampong, a rising British star, who said in an interview that a competitive, single-winner Turner Prize did not contribute to a \\u201cgood ecosystem\\u201d for art. \\u201cThis kind of thing where people get placed into an almost gladiatorial arena, is played out,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not healthy. It builds and creates a natural animosity over time amongst practitioners.\\u201d\", \"Achiampong added that Tate needs to rethink the prize so that it offers long-term support to its nominated artists and \\u201cdoes not treat people who deserve awards as tokens.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhat opportunities will be afforded for them afterward?\\u201d he said. \\u201cLet it not just be that the artist is used for a moment, but that they get given their dues.\\u201d\", \"Yet Farquharson, the Tate official, said it would be \\u201ccondescending to suggest that there would be some sort of aftercare,\\u201d adding that some of the shortlisted collectives had been working successfully for years before their nomination. The Turner Prize was already \\u201ca very supportive project,\\u201d he said.\", \"Whatever the jury\\u2019s decision this year, it is unlikely to cause a stir with the British public; bookmakers are not even taking bets on the outcome, unlike in the prize\\u2019s heyday. But within Britain\\u2019s art world, more is at stake.\", \"Anthea Hamilton, an artist who was nominated in 2016, said this year\\u2019s award was an invitation for Tate and other institutions to build on the conversation started by the nominees, \\u201cto be more outward looking\\u201d and \\u201cless focused on the sensational; the formal; the pretty; the material; the traditional accepted, comfortable ways of looking.\\u201d Will Tate take it up?\"]","href_hash":"179cd9304dd911eca04fcf809600a91b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"179cd9304dd911eca04fcf809600a91b"}},
