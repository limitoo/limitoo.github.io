Many Republicans in Kansas' legislature have publicly opposed vaccine mandates and other measures to slow the spread of COVID-19.\", \"\\\"The divisiveness,\\\" said Norman, \\\"really interfered with it. It was [like] sticking a stick into the spokes of a bicycle. There are many states where there hasn't been this kind of conflict.\\\"\", \"He drew comparisons between his firing and the right's treatment of Dr. Anthony Fauci, particularly from when former President Donald Trump was in office.\", \"\\\"The shameful treatment in the Trump administration of public health leaders, I think, set the stage for having the same thing happen at the state level,\\\" Norman said. \\\"Fauci was Fauci'd. And to be honest with you, I think I was Fauci'd.\\\"\", \"Shortly before Norman's departure, Kelly publicly opposed President Joe Biden's proposed vaccine mandate for government employees. Forty-eight Kansas counties lost their public or county health administrators due to the mandate, and Norman referred to these losses as a \\\"brain drain\\\" and supported COVID-19 vaccination.\", \"\\\"The vaccines are safe,\\\" he said. \\\"One of the counter-narratives that natural immunity is better than vaccine-driven immunity is simply not true. The longer we have non-immune individuals roaming the Earth, the more variants we are going to see emerge.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943463/laura-kelly-vaccine-mandates.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Kansas Governor Laura Kelly stands outside the front door of the governor's official residence for a holiday event on November 23, 2021, in Topeka.
