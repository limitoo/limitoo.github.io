That\\u2019s good news, and not just because fewer people are dying. Fear of infection was one reason the economic recovery hit an air pocket in the third quarter. Resuming normal life will be a huge relief.\", \"But the U.S. right is, in effect, trying to keep the pandemic going. We talk a lot about misinformation on social media, some of which \\u2014 surprise! \\u2014 appears to be the product of Russian disinformation. However, the role of the right-wing establishment has surely been far more important. Fox News serves up anti-vaccine messages almost every day. Republican governors have tried to ban vaccine mandates not just by local governments and school districts but by private businesses. Multiple Republican attorneys general have filed suit to stop federal vaccine mandates.\", \"The expressed rationale for all this activity is that it\\u2019s about protecting freedom. In reality, while there are several reasons for vaccine resistance, politics is a significant driver of the agitation. A successful vaccination campaign could mean a successful Biden administration, and the right is determined to prevent that, no matter how many avoidable deaths result from vaccine sabotage. It\\u2019s noteworthy that Fox has a very strict vaccination policy for its own employees.\", \"Still, the case against vaccine mandates, however disingenuous, needs to be answered on the merits. Yet I at least have rarely seen the case against a right to refuse vaccination fully explained, even though you could hardly come up with a better example than Covid-19 vaccination if you wanted to design a hypothetical situation in which arguments for freedom of choice don\\u2019t apply. And I think it\\u2019s worth spelling out exactly why.\", \"First, personal choice is fine \\u2014 as long as your personal choices don\\u2019t hurt other people. I may deplore the quality of your housekeeping, but it\\u2019s your own business; on the other hand, freedom doesn\\u2019t include the right to dump garbage in the street.\", \"And going unvaccinated during a pandemic does hurt other people \\u2014 which is why schools, in particular, have required vaccination against many diseases for generations. The unvaccinated are much more likely to contract the coronavirus, and hence potentially infect others, than those who\\u2019ve had their shots; there\\u2019s also some evidence that even when vaccinated individuals become infected, they\\u2019re less likely to infect others than the unvaccinated.\", \"Incidentally, the fact that breakthrough infections happen \\u2014 that some people get the virus despite being vaccinated \\u2014 actually strengthens the case for mandates, because it means that even those who\\u2019ve gotten their shots face some danger from those who refuse to follow suit.\", \"And the harm done to others by rejecting vaccines goes beyond an increased risk of disease. The unvaccinated are far more likely than the vaccinated to require hospitalization, which means that they place stress on the health care system. They also impose financial costs on the general public, because given the prevalence of insurance both public and private, their hospital bills end up being largely covered by the rest of us.\", \"Vaccination, then, should be considered a public duty, not a personal choice. But there would be a strong argument for public promotion of vaccines even if we were to somehow ignore the harm the unvaccinated impose on others and look only at the personal choice aspect. For this isn\\u2019t an area in which individuals can be relied on to choose well.\", \"Medicine, in case you haven\\u2019t noticed, is a complex and difficult subject. As a result, it\\u2019s an area where it\\u2019s a bad idea to leave people entirely to their own devices. The clamor for unproven treatments like taking hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin reminds us why we require that physicians be licensed and drugs be approved, rather than leaving it up to the public to decide who\\u2019s qualified and which medication is safe and effective.\", \"So you have to wonder why anyone would consider it a good idea when Florida\\u2019s surgeon general urged people to downplay medical advice on vaccines and rely on their \\u201cintuition and sensibilities.\\u201d\", \"Finally, the most contentious area in this whole argument involves vaccine and mask requirements for schools. And in this area, opponents of mandates aren\\u2019t making decisions for themselves \\u2014 they\\u2019re making decisions for their children, who have rights of their own and aren\\u2019t simply their parents\\u2019 property.\", \"Now, U.S. law and tradition give parents a great deal of leeway, especially when religious beliefs are involved, but not absolute power over their children\\u2019s lives. Adults can\\u2019t choose to deny their children basic education; they can\\u2019t turn down lifesaving medical treatment. That\\u2019s why we have longstanding vaccine mandates for many childhood diseases. And the same logic applies to Covid-19.\", \"Again, I don\\u2019t know how many people really believe that vaccine requirements are an attack on freedom. But in any case, it\\u2019s important to understand that freedom is no reason to block a potential medical miracle.\"]","href_hash":"3988acfa3b6d11ec9c4e000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3988acfa3b6d11ec9c4e000017025a03"}},
