Nance also said Postelle's actions were strongly influenced by his father, who reportedly suffered brain injuries as a result of the accident that motivated the shooting.\", \"Nance said Postelle is trusted by the prison staff, serving as an orderly in his unit and performing activities like serving meals and delivering mail, and his time in prison has changed him\\u2014claims which were argued against by families of the victims.\", \"\\\"We never got to see him after he was murdered because his body was riddled and torn with bullets,\\\" said Mary Jo Swindle, the mother of one of the victims. \\\"You may be a changed man, but my son and three others are still dead.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943711/oklahoma-gilbert-postelle-clemency-death-penalty.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">This Feb. 5, 2021 photo provided by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections shows Gilbert Postelle.

Rather than showing Amy mercy, he shot her in the back three times.\\\"\", \"\\\"He's a different man than he was,\\\" Nance said. \\\"I think he needs a certain amount of forgiveness because he grew up in an environment that was almost exclusively negative.\\\"\", \"Gilbert Postelle, who testified via a video link from prison, said he had been using meth for days before the killings and remembered little about the crimes.\", \"\\\"I do understand that I'm guilty and I accept that,\\\" he said. \\\"There's nothing more that I know to say to you all than I am truly sorry for what I've done to all these families.\\\"\", \"The board also heard from Gilbert Postelle's daughter and wife, who both urged the board to recommend his life be spared.\", \"\\\"My dad is my inspiration.
