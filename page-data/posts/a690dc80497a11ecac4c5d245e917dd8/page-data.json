Fearful that waning protection and the onset of winter will set off a wave of breakthrough infections, a growing number of governors had already offered boosters to everyone 18 and older ahead of the holidays.\", \"The agency said the expansion was justified by currently available clinical trial data as well as real-world evidence. In a statement, Dr. Peter Marks, who leads the F.D.A. division that regulates vaccines, added: \\u201cStreamlining the eligibility criteria and making booster doses available to all individuals 18 years of age and older will also help to eliminate confusion about who may receive a booster dose and ensure booster doses are available to all who may need one.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the federal government\\u2019s top infectious disease expert, has argued relentlessly over the past month for booster shots for all adults, a position shared by most of Mr. Biden\\u2019s other health advisers. Public health experts who argue that healthy younger adults do not need them, he has said, are ignoring the risks of symptomatic Covid-19.\", \"\\u201cEnough is enough. Let\\u2019s get moving on here,\\u201d he said at an event Wednesday night. \\u201cWe know what the data are.\\u201d\", \"Scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday unanimously endorsed booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus vaccines for all adults.\", \"If Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the agency\\u2019s director, formally accepts the recommendation, as she typically does, those who received a second shot of either Pfizer or Moderna at least six months ago will most likely be able to get a booster shot by the weekend.\", \"The F.D.A.\\u2019s action came after months of fierce debate within the administration and the scientific community about who needed booster shots, and when. Some outside advisers to the F.D.A. and C.D.C. repeatedly expressed discomfort with how quickly the administration was moving to offer the shots.\"]","href_hash":"a690dc80497a11ecac4c5d245e917dd8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a690dc80497a11ecac4c5d245e917dd8"}},
