However, he hasn't made an official announcement. His advisors reportedly told him to not announce before the 2022 midterms elections over fears that it could boost Democratic turnout and cause Republican candidates to lose, The Washington Post reported.\", \"Instead, Trump has focused on boosting like-minded Republicans. As of October 4, Trump has endorsed 37 candidates for the 2022 elections cycle. Of his endorsed candidates, 13 are running for Senate seats, 10 are vying for the House and the rest are running for governorships and state executive positions.\", \"\\\"President Trump's endorsement is the most powerful and sought-after endorsement in the history of American politics,\\\" Taylor Budowich, the communications director for Trump's other PAC Save America, told Fox News. \\\"He will continue to identify and support strong candidates who will advocate for his America First agenda in Congress and statehouses across the nation.\\\"\", \"Trump endorsed Republican Glenn Youngkin three times during Youngkin's victorious campaign to become Virginia's next governor. However, Youngkin distanced himself from Trump, never appearing with him in public.\", \"Nevertheless, Democrats sought to tie Youngkin to Trump, connecting him to Trump's policies like restricting ballot and abortion access as well as opposition to \\\"critical race theory\\\" being taught in schools.\", \"In a September 28 debate, Youngkin chided Democrats for repeatedly comparing him to Trump. \\\"You're running against me. It's Terry McAuliffe against Glenn Youngkin,\\\" Youngkin said. \\\"The only person invoking Trump is you.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"76f3b17f40e611ecb42e85b089d71c13"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"76f3b17f40e611ecb42e85b089d71c13"}},
