French prosecutors have opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances of the disaster, and the identities and nationalities of most of the victims have not been confirmed.\", \"The number of migrants setting off into the sea has soared in recent months because France has cracked down on other routes to England, especially by ferry or by truck and train through the tunnel under the Channel. So far this year, there have been 47,000 attempts to cross the Channel, and 7,800 migrants had been saved from shipwrecks, according to French officials.\", \"On Twitter, where he also published the full letter to Mr. Macron, Mr. Johnson wrote that \\u201can agreement with France to take back migrants who cross the Channel through this dangerous route would have an immediate and significant impact.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIf those who reach this country were swiftly returned, the incentive for people to put their lives in the hands of traffickers would be significantly reduced,\\u201d Mr. Johnson said. He called it \\u201cthe single biggest step\\u201d the two countries could take to address the issue.\", \"In his letter, Mr. Johnson noted that countries like Russia and Belarus already have readmission agreements with the European Union and that any bilateral agreement between France and Britain would be temporary, pending a broader deal between the E.U. and Britain.\", \"He also outlined other proposals, including better intelligence sharing, joint police patrols on French shores \\u2014 which France has already rejected \\u2014 and reciprocal maritime patrols in each country\\u2019s territorial waters.\", \"But French officials reacted furiously on Friday morning to the suggestion that France should take back migrants, calling the idea a nonstarter and accusing Mr. Johnson of using the migration crisis for domestic political ends.\", \"Mr. Darmanin, in a letter sent to Ms. Patel and that was seen by the Agence-France Presse, said he was \\u201cdisappointed\\u201d by the demands made in Mr. Johnson\\u2019s letter and found it \\u201ceven worse\\u201d that he had made them public.\", \"Mr. Attal, the French government spokesman, told BFMTV that the publicly shared letter \\u201cdid not match, at all, the exchanges that Boris Johnson had with the President over the phone as recently as Wednesday evening.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Attal added that the suggestion France should take back migrants who reach British shores \\u201cis obviously not what we need to fix the problem.\\u201d Instead, he said, Britain should send its own immigration officials to France, where they would examine the claims of asylum seekers trying to reach British shores.\", \"Grant Shapps, the British Transport secretary, defended Mr. Johnson\\u2019s letter, telling the BBC that \\u201cfriends and neighbors\\u201d had to work together and that he hoped France would reconsider disinviting Ms. Patel.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s in our interests,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s in their interests.
