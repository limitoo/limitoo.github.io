But in recent days he has also urged the world\\u2019s largest oil producers to pump more of those fuels.\", \"The incongruity was on center stage both at the summit taking place in Glasgow, and in Rome this past weekend during the Group of 20 gathering of leaders from the world\\u2019s largest economies. The president\\u2019s comments highlighted the political and economic realities facing politicians as they grapple with climate change.\", \"\\u201cOn the surface, it seems like an irony,\\u201d Mr. Biden said at a news conference on Sunday. \\u201cBut the truth of the matter is \\u2014 you\\u2019ve all known, everyone knows \\u2014 that the idea we\\u2019re going to be able to move to renewable energy overnight,\\u201d he said, was \\u201cjust not rational.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden\\u2019s words have drawn fire from energy experts and climate activists, who say the world cannot afford to ramp up oil and natural gas production if it wants to avert catastrophic levels of warming. Environmental groups are intensely watching to see how the president intends to meet his ambitious goal of halving the nation\\u2019s emissions, compared with 2005 levels, by the end of this decade.\", \"A recent International Energy Agency report found that countries must immediately stop new oil, gas and coal development if they hope to keep the average global temperature from increasing 1.5 Celsius above preindustrial levels, the threshold beyond which scientists say the Earth faces irreversible damage. The planet has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius.\", \"\\u201cWe are in a climate crisis. There is no room for the left hand and the right hand to be doing different things,\\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, the executive director at Greenpeace International. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not credible to say you\\u2019re fighting for 1.5 degrees while you\\u2019re calling for increased oil production.\\u201d\", \"With gasoline prices rising above $3.30 a gallon nationwide, Mr. Biden over the weekend urged major energy-producing countries with spare capacity to boost production, part of a larger effort to pressure Russia and the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase the supply of oil.\", \"He was joined by President Emmanuel Macron of France, whose country hosted the 2015 meeting in Paris where 200 countries agreed to collectively tackle global warming.\"]","href_hash":"910e2a4c3bd411ec9646000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"910e2a4c3bd411ec9646000017025a03"}},
