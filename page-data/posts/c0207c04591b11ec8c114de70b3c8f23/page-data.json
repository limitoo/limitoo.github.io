Mr. Brandst\\u00e4tter, will join the board andbegin managing the company\\u2019s business in China from Mr. Diess next summer. China is Volkswagen\\u2019s most important market outside of Europe, but the company has struggled to gain a toehold in the market for electric vehicles.\", \"Mr. Diess, however, will take on a new role as head of the company\\u2019s software unit, Cariad, which the carmaker views as essential to its future success.\", \"\\u201cWe have made important decisions and found good answers to make Volkswagen fit for the future,\\u201d the board chairman, Hans Dieter P\\u00f6tsch, told reporters afterward. He also apologized to shareholders for the uncertainty caused by the latest round of speculation about leadership at the company. VW\\u2019s stock price has fallen more than 20 percent over last six months.\", \"Mr. Diess said the review of executive responsibilities \\u201cwas an intensive process, and I am grateful that Mr. P\\u00f6tsche did not lose his patience.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBut I think it was a good process,\\u201d he added, \\u201cand at no time did I lose my motivation. The company is very important to me.\\u201d\", \"A crippling global shortage of semiconductors has slowed VW\\u2019s production lines, causing a 24 percent drop in third-quarter deliveries and a sharp fall in profit. Many workers have been stranded in temporary furloughs that were introduced to prevent layoffs during the pandemic but have been extended by the company.\", \"For months, Mr. Diess had been stressing the gap in efficiency between Volkswagen and Tesla, which he pointed out aims to assemble a car in just 10 hours at its new plant under construction outside Berlin, compared to nearly twice as long at some VW plants. He recently also invited Tesla\\u2019s chief, Elon Musk, to a discussion at a company retreat.\", \"The focus on the new rival automaker angered many Volkswagen\\u2019s employees, already frustrated over their inability to produce as many vehicles as they could because of the parts shortages.\", \"In perhaps a sign that Mr. Diess understood that all the references to Tesla were bothering people in Wolfsburg, where Volkswagen has its headquarters, he referred to the company during Thursday\\u2019s news conference as \\u201can American competitor building a plant in Gr\\u00fcnheide,\\u201d \\u2014 the location of Tesla\\u2019s nearly completed new factory \\u2014 but refused to state the company\\u2019s name, even when asked about it specifically.\", \"The board also outlined Volkswagen\\u2019s five-year plan, which will include investments of 159 billion euros, or $180 billion, with a focus on updating the company\\u2019s sites across Europe to supply and build electric vehicles. \", \"Spending for electric vehicles will be raised by about 50 percent to 52 billion euros, or $59 billion.\", \" \"]","href_hash":"c0207c04591b11ec8c114de70b3c8f23"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c0207c04591b11ec8c114de70b3c8f23"}},
