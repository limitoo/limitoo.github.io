It's not vaccines instead of distancing. It's not vaccines instead of ventilation or hand hygiene. Do it all. Do it consistently. Do it well.\\\"\", \"Tedros also voiced concerns that rapid booster rollouts could repeat \\\"vaccine hoarding\\\" seen previously and make the issue of vaccine inequity worse.\", \"\\\"Let me be very clear: WHO is not against boosters. We're against inequity. Our main concern is to save lives, everywhere.\\\"\", \"Pfizer and BioNTech are currently working on a new COVID vaccine that is specific to the Omicron variant. In a press release published on December 8, the companies said they hope to have it available for March 2022.\", \"Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson has also announced it has begun work on the design and development of a new vaccine against Omicron specifically and said it would \\\"rapidly progress it into clinical studies if needed\\\" in a November 29 press release.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952445/tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus speaking at the WHO headquarters in Geneva on October 18th, 2021.
