The uptick of coronavirus infections in the last month has upended live performances as severely here as on Broadway. During the holiday season, productions toppled one after another, unable to continue because of outbreaks in their casts or crews. Barely had Rebecca Frecknall\\u2019s revelatory revival of \\u201cCabaret,\\u201d starring Eddie Redmayne, opened to rave reviews before it lost a spate of performances, a scenario repeated on and off the West End.\", \"Shutdowns affected big productions like \\u201cMoulin Rouge!,\\u201d the epic Tony-winning musical whose much-delayed London opening is now scheduled for Jan. 20. But they also occurred at fringe theaters like the Bush, where a two-hander called \\u201cFair Play\\u201d closed within days of its premiere. (The run has since resumed.) Elsewhere, the organizers of the VAULT festival decided \\u201cwith broken hearts,\\u201d they said in a statement, to cancel what would have been the 10th anniversary edition of that important showcase for new work.\", \"The Royal Court and the National Theater, two prominent state-funded playhouses, shut their doors altogether during the lucrative holiday period, and, over in the commercial sphere, Andrew Lloyd Webber closed his new musical, \\u201cCinderella,\\u201d until February. \\u201cI am absolutely devastated,\\u201d the composer wrote on Twitter on Dec. 21.\", \"So you can imagine my delight this week to find the Donmar Warehouse back in business after being caught up in the closures, presenting the stage premiere of \\u201cForce Majeure,\\u201d adapted from the 2014 movie. (The play is scheduled to run through Feb. 5.) The audience at the 251-seat theater had to show proof of vaccination or a negative antigen test before entry, and we remained masked throughout \\u2014 something that, until recently, has been an all too rare sight here. (At \\u201cCinderella\\u201d back in August, I clocked scarcely a single mask.)\", \"I\\u2019m not sure that the playwright Tim Price\\u2019s adaptation, alas, is worth all the protocol. Those who know the Swedish director Ruben Ostlund\\u2019s Cannes Grand Jury prize-winner will recall its portrait of a marriage in free fall, which is sometimes bitterly funny but, more often than not, disturbing and even eerie. Set during five days in the French Alps, \\u201cForce Majeure\\u201d tells of a husband and wife and their two young children whose ski holiday doesn\\u2019t quite go as planned.\", \"Caught up in a controlled avalanche that appears to be out of control, Tomas abandons his family in the moment of crisis \\u2014 or so claims his wife, Ebba, who is shaken by his behavior. Before long, Tomas\\u2019s ready smile turns to howls of grief and an awareness that their relationship has been altered for keeps.\", \"The theatrical version\\u2019s director, Michael Longhurst, has turned the Donmar stage into a miniature ski slope, and the backdrop of Jon Bausor\\u2019s clever design shows off the snow-capped mountains essential to the action. What transfers less well is the darkening, ambiguous tone of a film that, in Price\\u2019s stage iteration, seems both more literal and more vulgar: Much is made of one character\\u2019s priapic tendencies. The couple\\u2019s stage children are sullen brats who would have been better off left at home, and the film\\u2019s extraordinary ending aboard a wayward bus has been discarded in favor of silly shenanigans in an overcrowded elevator.\", \"As the hapless couple, Rory Kinnear and Lyndsey Marshal, both fine actors, slalom their way between affection and recrimination in what plays for the most part as a routine domestic comedy. Tomas\\u2019s breakdown \\u2014 harrowing to watch onscreen \\u2014 elicited laughs from some spectators the other night.\", \"The stagecraft is more of an occasion at another play whose performances were interrupted late last year: \\u201cLife of Pi,\\u201d at Wyndham\\u2019s Theater, improbably brings to theatrical life the 2001 novel by Yann Martel that inspired the acclaimed 2012 film for which the director Ang Lee won an Oscar.\", \"In that version, 3-D plunges the moviegoer directly into the turbulent waters of a tale told largely at sea, as the teenage Pi, a zookeeper\\u2019s son, finds himself cast adrift on a lifeboat with only animals for company \\u2014 chief among them a Bengal tiger known as Richard Parker. Not to be outdone, the play brings together veterans from the world of video and puppetry who work alongside the director Max Webster and the designer Tim Hatley in conjuring an array of beasts before a rapt audience. The cast list includes six puppeteers for the tiger alone, overseen by the puppetry and movement director Finn Caldwell, who also designed the puppets with Nick Barnes.\", \"The result sometimes overpowers Lolita Chakrabarti\\u2019s script, which chronicles the story in flashback once Pi has made it to shore in Mexico, miraculously intact. We yearn for still more of the sound-and-light extravaganza that gives us giraffes and goats and a talking tiger, alongside the limber and likable Hiran Abeysekera as the indomitable Pi. (The more squeamish may recoil from the scene in which he eats \\u201creprocessed food,\\u201d as he calls it, to stay alive.)\", \"The play addresses issues of faith \\u2014 Pi\\u2019s story, we\\u2019re told, \\u201cwill make you believe in God\\u201d \\u2014 and of humankind as \\u201cthe most dangerous animal in the zoo.\\u201d But the appeal of \\u201cLife of Pi\\u201d lies not so much in blunt pronouncements as in the visual wonder of a bare stage yielding to richly imagined life. That\\u2019s one reason we go to the theater, and why it\\u2019s nice to have theaters to go to again.\"]","href_hash":"50422422744211ecaaf44f9ff803512e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"50422422744211ecaaf44f9ff803512e"}},
