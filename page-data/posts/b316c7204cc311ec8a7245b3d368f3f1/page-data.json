However, it fell short of what tennis officials, who still have not been able to establish independent contact with Peng, have been demanding since the Chinese government began attempting to censor any discussion of Peng\\u2019s allegations and her largely disappearing after posting them on one of China\\u2019s main social media outlets earlier this month, creating a standoff between two of the world\\u2019s leading sports organizations.\", \"Peng, 35, a three-time Olympian, had been missing since Nov. 2, when she used social media to accuse Zhang Gaoli, 75, a former vice premier of China, of sexually assaulting her at his home three years ago. She also described having had an on-and-off consensual relationship with Zhang.\", \"According to the I.O.C., Peng, held a 30-minute call with Thomas Bach, the organization\\u2019s president and a former Olympic fencer. In a statement posted on the I.O.C. website that accompanied a photo of the call, the organization said Peng stated \\u201cthat she is safe and well, living at her home in Beijing, but would like to have her privacy respected at this time. That is why she prefers to spend her time with friends and family right now.\\u201d\", \"A friend of Peng\\u2019s assisted her with her English, according to an Olympic official, though Peng became proficient in the language over her 15-year professional tennis career.\", \"Emma Terho, who chairs the I.O.C. athletes\\u2019 commission and participated in the call, said she was relieved to see that Peng appeared to be safe. \\u201cShe appeared to be relaxed,\\u201d Terho said. \\u201cI offered her our support and to stay in touch at any time of her convenience, which she obviously appreciated.\\u201d \", \"Peng\\u2019s disappearance following the allegations placed the I.O.C. under a microscope. Beijing is the host of the Olympic Winter Games in February, and officials and top sports figures had demanded the I.O.C. pressure the Chinese government to guarantee her safety and her ability to speak openly about the sexual assault allegation. \", \"The I.O.C. is facing substantial criticism for holding the Games in Beijing amid China\\u2019s crackdowns on dissent from prominent cultural and business figures like Jack Ma, founder of the internet firm Alibaba, its suppression of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and Tibet, and its treatment of Muslim minorities \\u2014 deemed genocide by the United States and lawmakers in several nations.\", \"According to the I.O.C. statement, Bach invited Peng to a dinner when he arrives for the Games in Beijing, which would include Terho and Li Lingwei, an I.O.C. member and Chinese Tennis Federation official who also participated in the call.\", \"However, the seemingly friendly banter and dinner plans did little to satisfy Steve Simon, the chief executive of the WTA Tour. Simon has been trying to establish independent contact with Peng for more than a week to no avail and has grown increasingly strident in his criticism of the Chinese government as its government-controlled media entities released a series of photos and videos of her. \", \"In a statement on Sunday following the release of the I.O.C. video, a spokesperson for the WTA and Simon said, \\u201cIt was good to see Peng Shuai in recent videos, but they don\\u2019t alleviate or address the WTA\\u2019s concern about her well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion. This video does not change our call for a full, fair and transparent investigation, without censorship, into her allegation of sexual assault, which is the issue that gave rise to our initial concern.\\u201d\", \"While several top sports officials have spoken out on Peng\\u2019s behalf, and asked the \\u201cWhere is Peng Shuai\\u201d question that has gone viral in recent weeks, only Simon has made it clear that his organization will not hold any tournaments in China if the government does not grant her permission to move freely, speak openly about the assault allegations and investigate the incident. \", \"The move could cost women\\u2019s pro tennis hundreds of millions of dollars of investment from China, but in a letter to China\\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. on Friday, Simon reiterated the organization\\u2019s position. He said the WTA would not be able to continue to hold its nine events in China, including the prestigious Tour Finals, scheduled to take place in Shenzhen through 2028, if he could not guarantee the safety of tennis players in the country. \", \"The men\\u2019s pro tour has also demanded assurance of Peng\\u2019s safety but has not threatened to stop holding tournaments in China, which has widely been viewed as a major growth market for all sports but presents significant moral hazards for anyone conducting business with an increasingly authoritarian government. \", \"\\u201cMoney trumps everything,\\u201d said Martina Navratilova, the former champion and tennis commentator, who defected to the United States when she was 18 years old to escape communist rule in Czechoslovakia. \", \"Navratilova is one of several leading tennis figures and government leaders to speak out on Peng\\u2019s behalf. As the chorus grew louder last week, Chinese media outlets began releasing snippets of Peng to try to convince a skeptical public that she was OK.\", \"Video clips of her at a Beijing restaurant were posted on the Twitter account of Hu Xijin, the chief editor of The Global Times, an influential Communist Party newspaper, who described them as showing Peng having dinner with her coach and friends on Saturday.\", \"Hu posted another video hours later, describing it as the opening ceremony of a teen tennis match final in Beijing on Sunday to which Peng \\u201cshowed up,\\u201d and then yet another of her signing tennis balls and posing for photos with children.\", \"On Friday, a journalist for another Chinese media entity released pictures said to be of Peng in what appeared to be a bedroom, surrounded by stuffed animals. In those photos, Peng appeared younger than she did in more recent images of her and there was nothing to verify when they had been taken.\", \"Those posts followed China\\u2019s state-owned broadcaster releasing a message that was supposedly from her.\", \"\\u201cHello everyone this is Peng Shuai,\\u201d it read. It called the accusation of sexual assault, which was made just weeks ago, untrue. \\u201cI\\u2019m not missing, nor am I unsafe,\\u201d the message said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been resting at home and everything is fine. Thank you again for caring about me.\\u201d\", \"The message was widely believed to have been written by someone other than Peng. \", \"\", \" \"]","href_hash":"b316c7204cc311ec8a7245b3d368f3f1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b316c7204cc311ec8a7245b3d368f3f1"}},
