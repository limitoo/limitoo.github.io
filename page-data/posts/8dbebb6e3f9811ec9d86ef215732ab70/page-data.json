(She did, after all, end the segment by singing \\u201cMy Way\\u201d and dousing herself in a giant box of wine.)\", \"But to the benefit of the show, Strong did not leave \\u201cS.N.L.,\\u201d and she was back tonight playing Pirro in the show\\u2019s cold open. She\\u2019d get a more memorable moment in the spotlight later in the night \\u2014 for now, the segment belonged to a rookie cast member, James Austin Johnson, who has rapidly become one of \\u201cS.N.L.\\u201d\\u2019s most versatile celebrity impressionists and brought his capable sendup of former president Donald J. Trump to the program for the first time.\", \"Strong began by interviewing a guest she introduced as \\u201can American brave enough to stand up and say, screw you science \\u2014 I know Joe Rogan.\\u201d That turned out to be Pete Davidson playing the Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who tested positive for the coronavirus earlier this week and confirmed, in a combative interview on Friday, that he was not vaccinated.\", \"Davidson, as Rodgers, defended his ambiguous remarks about his vaccination status. \\u201cI never lied,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI took all my teammates into a huddle, got all their faces three inches away from my wet mouth, and told them trust me, I\\u2019m more or less immunized. Go team!\\u201d\", \"He added, \\u201cAt the end of the day, my record is still 7-1. Meaning, of the eight people I\\u2019ve infected, seven are fine.\\u201d\", \"Strong also interviewed Alex Moffat, playing Glenn Youngkin, the Republican governor-elect of Virginia. When she asked him to provide a definition of critical race theory, Moffat answered, \\u201cIt\\u2019s simple: It\\u2019s what got me elected.\\u201d Pressed for more clarity, Moffat added, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not important. What\\u2019s important is parents.\\u201d\", \"He introduced Heidi Gardner as a member of his parental task force on education, and she cited some of the books she wanted removed from the state\\u2019s curriculum, including \\u201cPride and Prejudice\\u201d (\\u201cPrejudice is fine, but pride is a term that has been co-opted by the gays,\\u201d Gardner said) and \\u201cThe Great Gatsby\\u201d (\\u201cToo much jazz\\u201d).\", \"Strong brought out her surprise final guest: Trump, as played by Johnson (who is already holding down the recurring role of President Biden on \\u201cS.N.L.\\u201d).\", \"\\u201cI just wanted to congratulate Glenn Youngkin and mostly myself on a tremendous victory in Virginia,\\u201d Johnson said. \\u201cYou know what Glenn? We did it together.\\u201d\", \"Moffat uncomfortably replied, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to say that.\\u201d\", \"Johnson went on to deliver a discursive monologue, complete with a \\u201cPardon the Interruption\\u201d-style topic list and countdown clock, in which he rambled on about \\u201cStar Wars\\u201d (He claimed to have told George Lucas, \\u201cYou need to do it with swords \\u2014 the lasers are not enough\\u201d), \\u201cDune,\\u201d Timoth\\u00e9e Chalamet, Jason Momoa, \\u201cGame of Thrones\\u201d and, finally, the state of Virginia.\", \"An impressed Strong asked him, \\u201cHow do you keep that all in your brain?\\u201d\", \"Johnson answered, \\u201cI had my ears sealed so nothing comes in or out.\\u201d\", \"Kieran Culkin, who plays the sarcastic media scion Roman Roy on HBO\\u2019s \\u201cSuccession,\\u201d naturally used his opening monologue to crack some jokes about his role on that hit series. Roman, he said, is \\u201cone of the nicer characters on the show \\u2014 which still makes him one of the Top 10 worst humans on TV.\\u201d\", \"Culkin also reminded viewers that he had previously appeared on \\u201cS.N.L.\\u201d some 30 years ago when his brother Macaulay had hosted the program, and that 9-year-old Kieran had been hoisted aloft by grown-up cast members during the show\\u2019s good nights. Did a 39-year-old Kieran repeat the tradition at the end of this weekend\\u2019s broadcast? You\\u2019ll just have to watch and see. (OK, fine, he did repeat it.)\", \"This is why you watch an \\u201cS.N.L.\\u201d sketch all the way to the end. It seemed, at first, like a typical outing of \\u201cThe Dionne Warwick Talk Show,\\u201d a recurring segment in which Ego Nwodim plays a delightfully kooky version of that enduring pop singer. And as usual, she was joined by guests that she doesn\\u2019t recognize or particularly care about, including Chloe Fineman as Miley Cyrus, Culkin as Jason Mraz and Ed Sheeran as Ed Sheeran.\", \"But just as the sketch seemed to be winding down, Nwodim said, \\u201cI\\u2019m sick and tired of interviewing people who are not icons. Please welcome: me.\\u201d And out strode the real-life Warwick, who sat down in a chair opposite her. Nwodim asked the singer, \\u201cDionne, why are you perfect?\\u201d Warwick replied, \\u201cMy darling, I am not perfect. I\\u2019m just very, very good.\\u201d Their brief duet of \\u201cWhat the World Needs Now\\u201d that followed was almost too generous but we\\u2019ll take it anyway.\", \"Over at the Weekend Update desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che riffed on the passage of President Biden\\u2019s infrastructure plan in the House of Representatives, and the results of Tuesday\\u2019s elections.\", \"Jost began:\", \"Che continued:\", \"Here, as promised, was Cecily Strong\\u2019s true standout moment from the episode.\", \"At the Weekend Update desk, Jost began with a prelude about the recent Supreme Court arguments on a restrictive Texas law that bans most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. He then introduced Strong as a character called Goober the Clown Who Had an Abortion When She Was 23.\", \"While she sprayed Jost with water from a trick boutonniere and tried to make balloon animals, Strong talked about how common it is for clowns to have abortions and how they feel more comfortable discussing the subject with one another when they learn that other clowns have had them. It was not the easiest subject to mine for comedy. But as Strong explained, describing a doctor who jokingly asked if she had gotten pregnant on her way over to the clinic, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not like a funny ha-ha joke, but like a funny, you\\u2019re not an awful person and your life isn\\u2019t over now joke. The best kind.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8dbebb6e3f9811ec9d86ef215732ab70"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8dbebb6e3f9811ec9d86ef215732ab70"}},
