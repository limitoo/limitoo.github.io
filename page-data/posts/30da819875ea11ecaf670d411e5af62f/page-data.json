Bathed in the buttery glow of three table lamps, almost every surface of the room is covered with books. There are books on the tables, books stacked on mahogany ladders, and books atop still more books lining the shelves of the room. \\u201cI hope you see the beauty in this that I do,\\u201d Mr. Winslow wrote in the tweet, which has been acknowledged with 32,800 hearts.\", \"If you spend enough time in the literary corners of Twitter, this image may look familiar. It rises again just about annually, and the library has been attributed over the years to authors including Umberto Eco and buildings in Italy and Prague. As with other images featuring beautiful bookshelves, people go absolutely bananas for it. Mr. Winslow\\u2019s post received 1,700 comments, including one from a professor at Pace University who has been using the photo as his Zoom background.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s clearly the home of a person who loves and collects books,\\u201d Mr. Winslow said in an email through his agent, Shane Salerno. \\u201cFor me, I think that photo is as stunning as a sunset. I could spend days and days locked in that library examining each book.\\u201d He noted that there\\u2019s something comforting about the image, since \\u201cit\\u2019s a room you could happily get lost in.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Winslow had no idea the origin of the photo. He himself had found it on Twitter, but didn\\u2019t remember the name or location of the library. (Though he believed it to be the personal library of a prominent author from another country.)\", \"The library, it should be known, is not in Europe. It doesn\\u2019t even exist anymore. But when it did, it was the home library of Johns Hopkins professor Dr. Richard Macksey in Baltimore. (I was his student in 2015 and interviewed him for Literary Hub in 2018.) Dr. Macksey, who passed away in 2019, was a book collector, polyglot and scholar of comparative literature. At Hopkins, he founded one of the country\\u2019s first interdisciplinary academic departments and organized the 1966 conference \\u201cThe Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man,\\u201d which included the first stateside lectures by the French theorists Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan and Paul de Man.\", \"Dr. Macksey\\u2019s book collection clocked in at 51,000 titles, according to his son, Alan, excluding magazines and other ephemera. A decade ago, the most valuable pieces \\u2014 including first editions of \\u201cMoby Dick,\\u201d T.S. Eliot\\u2019s \\u201cPrufrock and Other Observations,\\u201d and works by Wordsworth, Keats and Shelley \\u2014 were moved to a \\u201cspecial collections\\u201d room on the Hopkins campus. After Dr. Macksey\\u2019s death, a S.W.A.T. team-like group of librarians and conservationists spent three weeks combing through his book-filled, 7,400-square-foot house to select 35,000 volumes to add to the university\\u2019s libraries.\", \"Surprise discoveries included an 18th-century Rousseau text with charred covers (found in the kitchen), a \\u201cpristine\\u201d copy of a rare 1950s exhibition catalog showing Wassily Kandinsky\\u2019s paintings, posters from the May 1968 protests when students in Paris occupied the Sorbonne, a hand-drawn Christmas card from the filmmaker John Waters, and the original recordings of the theorists at that 1966 structuralism conference.\", \"\\u201cFor years, everyone had said \\u2018there\\u2019s got to be recordings of those lectures.\\u2019 Well, we finally found the recordings of those lectures. They were hidden in a cabinet behind a bookshelf behind a couch,\\u201d said Liz Mengel, associate director of collections and academic services for the Sheridan Libraries at Johns Hopkins. Several first editions by 20th-century poets and novelists sat on a shelf in the laundry room.\", \"After the librarians from Hopkins and nearby Loyola Notre Dame were finished selecting their donations, the remaining books were carted away by a dealer, so Dr. Macksey\\u2019s son could prepare the house to be sold.\", \"The library image sidesteps all those details to evoke something more universal, said Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of the Aesthetics of Joy, a blog about the relationship between d\\u00e9cor and delight. \\u201cWe\\u2019re attracted to the image, and we come up with all sorts of stories about who it might be and what it might be because we love to tell stories,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut what\\u2019s really driving the attraction is much more visceral.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Fetell Lee pointed to the photo\\u2019s sense of abundance. \\u201cThere\\u2019s something about the sensorial abundance of seeing lots of something that gives us a little thrill,\\u201d she said. Also relevant: the \\u201csatisfying\\u201d sense of organized chaos, and the awe inspired by the high ceilings.\", \"Pictures of books and libraries are popular across social platforms. A representative from Instagram said that some of the top-liked posts on the platform that include the words \\u201clibrary\\u201d or \\u201clibraries\\u201d feature large quantities of books, a \\u201ccozy\\u201d aesthetic or a warmer color scheme.\", \"What would Dr. Macksey think if he knew his library had taken on a life of its own? \\u201cMy dad liked nothing better than sharing his love of books and literature with others,\\u201d Alan Macksey said. \\u201cHe\\u2019d be delighted that his library lives on through this photo.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"30da819875ea11ecaf670d411e5af62f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"30da819875ea11ecaf670d411e5af62f"}},
