Please shop in person.\\\"\", \"The video showed boxed packages stacked up in the back of the truck on top of one another, covering the majority of the space. There remained nearly no room for Ruiz to walk to the other end of the truck.\", \"In a comment, Ruiz confirmed that he hadn't finished loading the deliveries yet and actually ended up with 235.\", \"\\\"F*** work but i'll see y'all tomorrow,\\\" he captioned the video.\", \"With over 250,000 views, many took the opportunity to consider the delivery drivers having to work through the long list of Black Friday orders, while others even apologised for their own hefty packages.\", \"\\\"You make my life and so many others so much easier,\\\" noted one TikTok user.\", \"\\\"I used to be a delivery driver and all these people in the comments clearly have never worked those 70+ hour weeks to get everything delivered,\\\" wrote one user.\", \"Similarly, a retail worker expressed similar stress around Black Friday, writing: \\\"As a retail worker I feel you. Stressful on our end too. But I know, every year your trucks are going to get fuller and fuller.\\\"\", \"Other however argued that the deliveries shown weren't actually that many, in comparison to other experiences: \\\"I work at FedEx. That truck isn't even that full. I see lots of room on the shelves,\\\" commented one user.\", \"Despite Ruiz's deliveries clearly being higher than usual, online spending on Black Friday this year actually decreased from the previous year. According to statistics from Adobe Analytics, online shoppers spent a total of $8.9 billion this year, slightly less than 2020's $9 billion.\", \"This doesn't necessarily mean that individuals actually spent less overall however, as Adobe pinpointed early sales as a possible cause for the fall. Some retailers began offering Black Friday deals as early as October.\", \"Global supply chain issues were also marked as another possible culprit, with a 124 percent increase in out-of-stock messages since January 2020, meaning many Black Friday shoppers simply couldn't buy the items they wanted.\", \"Ruiz wouldn't be the first individual to go viral on TikTok for showing heaps of delivery parcels either. In August, TikTok user Tierra Lopez racked up millions of views after filming the mass amount of parcels delivered to her neighbor's house.\", \"Later videos showed the parcels still in the front garden, covered by blue tarp, as a moving van reversed into the lawn to drop off even more.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942327/fedex-lorry-driver.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">FedEx courier Nate Channing loads his truck with packages December 8, 2006 in San Francisco, California.
