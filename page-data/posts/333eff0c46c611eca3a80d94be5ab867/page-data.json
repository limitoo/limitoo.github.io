They took issue with an expert witness\\u2019s planned testimony on sexual abuse. And they asked the federal judge overseeing the trial to preclude federal prosecutors from referring to her accusers as \\u201cvictims.\\u201d\", \"The flurry of recent motions, hearings and rulings has begun to define the playing field for Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s highly anticipated trial. Jurors, who will begin to be chosen on Tuesday, will hear Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s accusers testify that she recruited them as minors for sexual acts with Mr. Epstein and others, in a trial that is widely seen as a proxy for trying Mr. Epstein himself.\", \"Ms. Maxwell, 59, the daughter of a British media mogul and once a fixture in New York\\u2019s social scene, will be tried on six counts, including transporting minors to engage in criminal sexual activity. She has steadfastly maintained her innocence, and her lawyers have sought to undermine the credibility of her accusers and question the motives of prosecutors \\u2014 efforts they have indicated they would continue at trial.\", \"Their concern about the use of the term \\u201cvictim\\u201d was rooted in fairness, her lawyers have argued. \\u201cIn some criminal cases, the parties agree that an accuser was the victim of a crime,\\u201d they wrote to Judge Alison J. Nathan this month. \\u201cThis is not one of those cases. Rather, Ms. Maxwell denies that she victimized anyone. And there is ample evidence to support her defense.\\u201d\", \"But as with most of the motions filed on Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s behalf so far, Judge Nathan did not agree. She ruled that prosecutors will be allowed to describe the accusers as \\u201cvictims\\u201d and, in another win for the U.S. attorney\\u2019s office in Manhattan, the accusers will be allowed to testify under pseudonyms; courtroom artists are prohibited from sketching their likeness.\", \"The pretrial filings and decisions do not appear to have fundamentally altered the question at the core of the case.\", \"\\u201cThe question at trial,\\u201d prosecutors wrote, \\u201cwill be whether the defendant took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of 18, knowing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with those girls.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Epstein, 66, was arrested in July 2019 on sex-trafficking charges. He was found dead in a Manhattan detention center a month later; his death was ruled a suicide. Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers have argued that the Manhattan U.S. attorney\\u2019s office only pursued her after Mr. Epstein\\u2019s death, and that they have \\u201ceffectively punished\\u201d her for his death by holding her for nearly 17 months in \\u201coverly restrictive conditions.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers have also repeatedly questioned the strength of the government\\u2019s case. The defense has long argued that the government has built its case on decades-old allegations \\u2014 the indictment charges criminal activity by Ms. Maxwell from 1994 to 2004 \\u2014 and that her accusers\\u2019 statements lack independent corroboration.\", \"Prosecutors, for their part, have asked Judge Nathan to prevent Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers from making arguments to the jury about the government\\u2019s \\u201cmotives\\u201d for bringing the case, and from introducing evidence about past investigations into Mr. Epstein. In a recent court hearing, Judge Nathan said she would block the defense from introducing some evidence about how the investigation was conducted; she also barred Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers from introducing evidence about the public outcry and heightened media scrutiny that preceded her arrest.\", \"But the defense has won a few key legal skirmishes.\", \"Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers had asked the judge to block the government from having one of its expert witnesses, a clinical psychologist, testify about \\u201cgrooming\\u201d \\u2014 a strategy predators use to try to break down a potential victim\\u2019s resistance to abusive conduct.\", \"Judge Nathan ruled that the expert would be allowed to testify about grooming, a concept she said was \\u201cwell-accepted in the relevant literature.\\u201d But she sided with Ms. Maxwell on a narrower point: The expert may not offer her opinion that grooming can be done to facilitate abuse by a third party in what the defense has called \\u201cgrooming by proxy.\\u201d\", \"And although prosecutors have argued in bail hearings that Ms. Maxwell was in hiding for months before her arrest, they have indicated they will not argue at her trial that she was trying to evade law enforcement between Epstein\\u2019s arrest and her own, court filings show.\", \"Judge Nathan said she would not rule on some matters before the trial begins, such as introducing evidence of other victims.\", \"In recent weeks, prosecutors told the defense that they will argue Ms. Maxwell had three co-conspirators: Mr. Epstein, and two people whose names have been redacted. Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers have objected to evidence about the co-conspirators, saying prosecutors identified them to the defense only weeks before trial. Neither are available to testify, nor have they been granted immunity, Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers said.\", \"Despite her repeated bids for release on bail from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, Ms. Maxwell is all but certain to spend the duration of the trial in custody. At a hearing earlier this month, her lawyer, Bobbi C. Sternheim, described how Ms. Maxwell had been awakened at 3:45 a.m. and delivered before dawn to the downtown Manhattan courthouse where her trial will be held.\", \" \\u201cShe had to get on her hands and knees to climb into the van because her leg shackles would not permit her to step up,\\u201d Ms. Sternheim said. In the courthouse, Ms. Maxwell sat in a cold cell block, with little food and no utensils.\", \"In letters to the court, Ms. Sternheim elaborated on what she depicted as the mistreatment of her client. She likened the level of surveillance on Ms. Maxwell to that of Hannibal Lecter in \\u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\\u201d saying she was subject to repeated pat searches, regular checks with flashlights and complete isolation.\", \"\\u201cMs. Maxwell is being treated differently than other defendants,\\u201d Ms. Sternheim wrote. \\u201cHarvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby were permitted to walk into the courthouse each day of their respective trials.\\u201d\", \"But Judge Nathan rejected Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s latest request for release \\u2014 the fourth time the judge has done so \\u2014 agreeing with prosecutors that Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s personal wealth and foreign ties make her a flight risk. Her transportation to the courthouse, Judge Nathan said, should be done \\u201cin a way that is humane, proper, and consistent with security protocols.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"333eff0c46c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"333eff0c46c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
