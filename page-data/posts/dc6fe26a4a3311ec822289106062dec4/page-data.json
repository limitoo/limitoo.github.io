diminishes your chances of catching the virus altogether.\", \"But no vaccine is 100 per cent effective, and breakthrough infections do occur.\", \"While they're generally milder\\u00a0and estimated to happen in only a small proportion of people, the possibility of getting infected post-vaccination has left many Australians wondering: am I still at risk of getting long COVID if I'm immunised?\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What is long COVID?</div>\", \"In most cases, COVID-19 symptoms resolve after a couple of weeks.\", \"But in a sizeable proportion of patients, symptoms linger for months\\u00a0and sometimes leave people debilitated and unable to work.\", \"The persistence of symptoms \\u2014\\u00a0or onset of new ones \\u2014\\u00a0months after infection is known as long COVID, post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), or post COVID-19.\", \"The World Health Organization (WHO) recently defined long COVID as a condition that \\\"usually occurs three months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms [that] last for at least two months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis\\\".\", \"Most commonly, patients report fatigue, breathlessness and \\\"brain fog\\\", but up to 205 symptoms have been identified, including dizziness, loss of taste and smell, muscle spasms and irritable bowels.\", \"\\\"Long COVID covers almost every organ system in the body,\\\" said Jeremy Nicholson, head of the Australian National Phenome Centre at Murdoch University, which investigates the causes and origins of disease.\", \"\\\"There are kidney effects, liver effects, neurological effects \\u2026 chronic fatigue syndrome.\", \"\\\"All of these things are linked together in COVID-19.\\\"\", \"<img

symptoms?</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Who is at risk of long COVID?</div>\", \"When it comes to how many people infected with SARS-CoV-2 go on to develop long COVID, estimates vary considerably.\", \"One Australian study of about 3,000 people diagnosed with COVID-19 in 2020 found 5 per cent of patients experienced symptoms more than three months after their initial infection.\", \"But more recently, a large UK study of more than 273,000 people found one in three patients had long COVID symptoms three to six months after getting infected.\", \"Some estimates are even higher.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/717cab70765738ca07e1558077c9f9d6\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Many long COVID patients report

leading long COVID research at St Vincent's hospital in Sydney, said it wasn't clear why long COVID affected some people and not others.\", \"\\\"There are probably multiple different causes of long COVID, so identifying risk factors can be tricky,\\\" said Professor Matthews of UNSW's Kirby Institute.\", \"That isn't to say having a mild infection guarantees a quick recovery.\", \"Since COVID-19 only hospitalises a minority of people, most long COVID sufferers are people who had mild symptoms \\u2014\\u00a0or even no symptoms \\u2014\\u00a0when they were first infected.\", \"\\\"The other interesting thing that comes out in many of these studies \\u2026 is that being female predicts a greater chance of getting symptoms of long COVID,\\\" Professor Matthews said.\", \"Other research suggests older people and those with underlying conditions are also at increased risk.\", \"There's evidence that children are capable of developing long COVID too.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Does vaccination change things?</div>\", \"So far, it appears a relatively small number of fully vaccinated people develop long COVID symptoms \\u2014\\u00a0but it's too early to say exactly how common such cases are.\", \"Professor Matthews says\\u00a0although COVID-19 vaccines don't eliminate your risk entirely, they reduce your chances of getting long COVID.\", \"That's primarily because COVID-19 vaccines help to prevent you contracting the disease in the first place.\", \"But research also suggests being fully vaccinated decreases your risk of long COVID, even if a breakthrough infection occurs.\", \"A UK study tracking 1.2 million adults found the odds of having COVID-19 symptoms more than 28 days post-infection were\\u00a0approximately halved among people who were fully vaccinated (compared to those who were unvaccinated).\", \"The study relied on self-reported data from users of the COVID Symptom Study phone app.\", \"\\\"If you have only half the number of people who get symptoms at four weeks, you're going to have considerably less people who get symptoms at 12 weeks, and therefore have long COVID,\\\" Professor Matthews said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How do vaccines reduce long COVID?</div>\", \"In addition to reducing infections overall, Professor Nicholson said vaccines were likely driving down rates of long COVID because they were reducing the number of people getting severely ill.\", \"\\\"If you've been on a ventilator or you've got severe respiratory symptoms, you are more likely to get long COVID respiratory symptoms,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"In that respect, vaccines will definitely reduce long COVID, because you're taking away the respiratory damage [that] occurs in severe disease.\\\"\", \"<img

pro-vice chancellor for Murdoch University\\u2019s Health Future Institute, Jeremy Nicholson.(Supplied: Murdoch University)</div>\", \"What was less clear, he said, was whether vaccines would help to reduce long COVID symptoms triggered by mild or asymptomatic infections, which were typically more \\\"systemic effects in other organ systems\\\".\", \"\\\"The people who don't get seriously ill [from COVID] have got a very strong cellular response that destroys the virus and the cells that are making it,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"What's interesting \\u2014\\u00a0and what we don't understand yet \\u2014\\u00a0is why that can still lead to long COVID at the systemic level.\\\"\", \"Professor Nicholson and his team, who have been studying thousands of blood samples from people who have had COVID-19, suspect long COVID is a consequence of people's immune systems misfiring, and working overtime following infection.\", \"\\\"The overall process of cellular destruction in protecting the body against the acute respiratory phase actually sets off a series of other biochemical events, which we think relate to long COVID,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Effectively, your immune system is damaging itself.\\\"\", \"Others have theorised that long COVID might be the result of persistent viral reservoirs in the body, genetic factors, and blood clots.\", \"\\\"We're going to be working on this and trying to understand it for many years \\u2014\\u00a0probably decades.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Long COVID a 'huge burden' globally</div>\", \"Even with the help of vaccines, Professor Nicholson said long COVID\\u00a0would present a huge financial and social burden globally for years to come.\", \"\\\"Using the most conservative statistics available, there will be 5 million people with long COVID that will have it certainly for months, and potentially for many years,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"If you take into account the fact that you can have asymptomatic long-COVID \\u2014\\u00a0that's when you're metabolically abnormal, but you don't necessarily show any symptoms \\u2014\\u00a0[that figure] could be potentially tens of millions of people worldwide that could get long COVID.\\\"\", \"As for whether COVID-19 vaccines can alleviate some of the symptoms that long COVID patients experience \\u2014\\u00a0which some people have reportedly found \\u2014 Professor Matthews says it's too early to tell.\", \"She says\\u00a0her team is currently measuring how people's immune systems respond to vaccination, and what that looks like in people with long COVID.\", \"\\\"This will give us some more information as to what vaccination is doing to alter the immune system, that may then help us understand what's causing long COVID.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"dc6fe26a4a3311ec822289106062dec4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dc6fe26a4a3311ec822289106062dec4"}},
