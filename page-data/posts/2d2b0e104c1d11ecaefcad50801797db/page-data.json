Yet the book\\u2019s tone is largely fond.\", \"The people who created HBO made something they\\u2019re proud of. They\\u2019re glad to have been there, to have had a piece of it, in the early, freewheeling decades. Most know they\\u2019ll never have it so good again.\", \"HBO went live on Nov. 8, 1972, broadcasting to a few hundred houses in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. The first thing you saw on the screen (cue screaming from future Time Warner shareholders) was Jerry Levin, sitting on a sofa. He welcomed viewers, then kicked it over to a hockey game from Madison Square Garden, which was followed by Paul Newman in \\u201cSometimes a Great Notion.\\u201d\", \"Levin was an ambitious young lawyer who had been brought in by a cable company, Sterling Communications, to run HBO\\u2019s start-up programming. \\u201cTinderbox\\u201d explains how Sterling eventually ran wires to all those buildings in Manhattan and elsewhere, sometimes via sublegal methods.\", \"Levin, of course, would become the architect of the most ill-judged merger in media history. At the height of the dot-com bubble in 2000, he tried to combine Time Warner, of which HBO was a subsidiary, with Steve Case\\u2019s already sinking AOL. In the ruinous wake, Levin resembled the proverbial hedgehog, the one who climbs off the hairbrush while sheepishly muttering, \\u201cWe all make mistakes.\\u201d\", \"If you\\u2019re going to read \\u201cTinderbox,\\u201d prepare for a landslide of corporate history. Students of power will find much to interest them. HBO had many stepparents over the years. Following these deals is complicated, like following the lyrics to \\u201cThere Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly.\\u201d\", \"In reverse order, Miller describes how HBO \\u2014 the fly, more or less, in this scenario \\u2014 has been sequentially consumed from 1972 through today: \\u201cWarner Bros. Discovery rescued it from AT&T, which had gobbled it up from Time Warner, which had saved it from Time Warner AOL, which had somehow abducted it from Time Warner, which had shrewdly outplayed Time Inc. for it, after Time had outflanked Sterling Communications long ago.\\u201d\", \"Miller, who has previously compiled oral histories of \\u201cSaturday Night Live,\\u201d ESPN and Creative Artists Agency, digs into the machinations and bruised egos behind these deals.\", \"These guys (they were mostly guys) all seemed to want to flex-cuff one another and throw enemies into the back of a van. Miller gets good quotes: \\u201cThe only way I was going to sit across a table from Jerry was if I could jump across it and grab him by the throat\\u201d; \\u201cHe\\u2019s a dog, he\\u2019ll follow whoever feeds him.\\u201d\", \"HBO\\u2019s famous bumper \\u2014 the static, the celestial choir \\u2014 didn\\u2019t debut until 1993. But the channel had an aura long before that. It began to make its mark on popular culture in the late 1970s and early \\u201980s, around the time I was in my teens.\", \"My family didn\\u2019t have HBO, but a friend\\u2019s did. It was where you clicked to see George Carlin say the seven words you couldn\\u2019t say on television, to watch movies with naked people in them and to laugh your ribs loose seeing comedians (Robert Klein, Bette Midler, Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams) do material they\\u2019d never get away with on Carson.\", \"HBO was so sexy people went to hotels to watch it. The channel had no advertisers, and thus no one to complain about brash or steamy content.\", \"Before HBO, television in the hands of the big three networks was a wasteland \\u2014 \\u201ca vast exercise in condescension,\\u201d as Robert Hughes put it, \\u201cby quite smart people to millions of others whom they assume to be much dumber than they actually are.\\u201d\", \"An important early hire was Sheila Nevins, stolen from CBS to run HBO\\u2019s now-storied documentary unit. A Barbra Streisand concert was an early hit. Boxing was vital to the early growth of HBO, as were midweek broadcasts of Wimbledon. The channel launched a million comedy clubs. If you were a comic without an HBO special, you weren\\u2019t on the map.\", \"HBO branched out into original movies, some of which I was happy to see recalled: \\u201cGia,\\u201d with Angelina Jolie; \\u201cMurderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story,\\u201d with Ben Kingsley and \\u201cAlways Outnumbered, Always Outgunned,\\u201d based on the Walter Mosley novel, with Laurence Fishburne, among others.\", \"\\u201cTinderbox\\u201d slows down and lingers purposefully on the turn of the century, when the so-called golden age of television began to come into view. With shows like \\u201cSex and the City,\\u201d \\u201cSix Feet Under,\\u201d \\u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\\u201d and especially \\u201cThe Sopranos,\\u201d HBO changed notions of what television could be, and pickpocketed the cultural conversation from film.\", \"\\u201cThe Sopranos\\u201d was not an immediate hit, but it was beloved internally. \\u201cWe were putting a husky guy with a hairy back wearing a wife-beater in the lead role,\\u201d says Jeff Bewkes, a former Time Warner C.E.O. \\u201cNobody else would do that.\\u201d\", \"HBO had good luck with its early executives. These were the kind of guys who knew what a debenture was yet had a feel for programming and knew enough to hire good people and leave them alone. HBO gave people room to run.\", \"Often the only direction given to directors and producers was: Don\\u2019t make anything you\\u2019d see anywhere else. Winning awards was more important than ratings. Before HBO, elite actors wouldn\\u2019t go near a television show.\", \"Staffers at HBO sometimes found it hard to define what HBO was, but they knew what it wasn\\u2019t. A planned Howie Mandel special was killed.\", \"HBO\\u2019s luck held for a while after \\u201cThe Sopranos\\u201d signed off. Lena Dunham\\u2019s \\u201cGirls\\u201d and \\u201cGame of Thrones\\u201d were in the wings. But the souk that is the modern television world was growing crowded.\", \"HBO was no longer the brash insurgent. It passed on shows \\u2014 \\u201cMad Men,\\u201d \\u201cHouse of Cards,\\u201d \\u201cOrange Is the New Black,\\u201d \\u201cBreaking Bad,\\u201d \\u201cThe Crown\\u201d \\u2014 that went on to become crucial hits for Netflix and other cable and streaming services.\", \"Oral history is a strange form. It gives you a staccato series of micro-impressions, as if you were looking through a fly\\u2019s compound eyes. George Plimpton, who helped edit the best-selling oral biography \\u201cEdie,\\u201d was a fan. He liked it that \\u201cthe reader, rather than editor, is jury.\\u201d\", \"Elizabeth Hardwick loathed the form. She thought oral histories were full of irresponsible drive-by shootings. The result, she wrote, was that \\u201cyou are what people have to say about you.\\u201d\", \"Increasingly I\\u2019m a fan of the genre. I have a special fondness for Lizzy Goodman\\u2019s \\u201cMeet Me in the Bathroom: Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City 2001-2011,\\u201d and I await the oral histories of Chez Panisse, Balthazar, Death and Company (the bar), n+1, Anna Wintour\\u2019s tenure at Vogue, Monster Energy drinks, the making of \\u201cDusty in Memphis\\u201d and this newspaper\\u2019s Styles section.\", \"Miller is a good interviewer, but a corny writer. His interstitial material is mugged by phrases like \\u201coodles of ambition\\u201d and words like \\u201cginormous.\\u201d These really bugged me at the start. But this book is so vast that, by the weary end, these pats of cold margarine slapping me in the face were the only things keeping me awake.\", \"There are a lot of winning moments in \\u201cTinderbox.\\u201d But wading through its nearly thousand pages I often felt spacey and exhausted, as if it were 4 a.m. on the third night of one of those endurance contests and I had to keep my hand on the pickup truck.\", \"HBO has retained much of its magic. \\u201cSuccession\\u201d: what a treat. The sound of that bumper \\u2014 the static, the choir \\u2014 remains Pavlovian in its promise. But our over-entertained eyeballs have more options, and the channel\\u2019s competitors, Miller makes clear, have the long knives sharpened.\"]","href_hash":"2d2b0e104c1d11ecaefcad50801797db"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2d2b0e104c1d11ecaefcad50801797db"}},
