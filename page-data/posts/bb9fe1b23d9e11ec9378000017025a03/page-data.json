Kosa is the chairman of parliament's Committee on Defense and Law Enforcement.\", \"The system is produced by NSO Group, which is based in Israel. It marks the first time a government official from Hungary admitted that they had used malware, something that has been in the news since an investigation from July of 2021 revealed that Pegasus was used in Hungary.\", \"Those targeted included at least 10 lawyers, an undisclosed amount of journalists, and a politician.\", \"Kosa insisted there was no illegal activity involved in the use of the Pegasus software. He said officials had received permission from courts or the Ministry of Justice before use.\", \"The usage of Pegasus against journalists comes after accusations from the European Union that right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been increasingly taking control of Hungary's media. His critics say that he is bringing the country into \\\"increasingly autocratic rule,\\\" according to AP.\", \"The Biden administration said it will place export limits on NSO Group.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926459/lajos-kosa.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Lajos Kosa, chairman of parliament's Committee on Defense and Law Enforcement, revealed to the media that the Interior Ministry of Hungary used the military-grade spyware Pegasus to spy on businesspeople, journalists and even an opposition politician.

According to Hungarian state news agency MTI, he argued that \\\"tech giants conduct much wider surveillance\\\" on their users than the Hungarian government had.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926454/nso-group.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Pegasus, the spyware that the Hungarian government admits it used to spy on businesspeople, journalists and an opposition politician, is produced by NSO Group, which is based in Israel.
