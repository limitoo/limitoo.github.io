They don't talk about it, purposely. It was so bad that it was killing him. Two, three days after it ended, they stopped even mentioning it,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"What they did with the so-called withdrawal, which was really a surrender, what they did, it was the most embarrassing, horrible thing, and I don't know that we ever psychologically recover from that,\\\" Trump added.\", \"The former president also said that the generals should be held \\\"responsible because they should have never allowed that to happen.\\\" He noted that the generals could have also convinced Biden \\\"into reason\\\" when handling the August withdrawal.\", \"During his interview, Trump said that the withdrawal should have been handled differently and recalled his deal with the Taliban that involved taking out U.S. troops by May 2021.\", \"\\\"Don't forget, I'm the one that brought it down to 2,500 troops. I would have been out too, but we would have been out with strength. We would have come out with strength,\\\" he said.\", \"Trump noted that if he was in control of the withdrawal operation, he would have retained control over the Parwan Detention facility, a military prison located next to the Bagram Air Base.\", \"The former president blamed Biden for the 13 U.S. service members killed in an ISIS-led terrorist attack outside of Kabul's international airport and for leaving behind military equipment and some American citizens and U.S. holders in Afghanistan.\", \"\\\"We would have gotten all the people out, we would have brought all of our equipment out, we wouldn't have had dead soldiers, we wouldn't have soldiers missing arms and legs\\u2014because people don't even talk about that\\u2014we lost 13, but we have many that have been gravely wounded,\\\" he said.\", \"Trump repeatedly blamed Biden for the Afghanistan withdrawal. At one point, he said that the president should have evacuated American citizens first before taking out military members.\", \"The former president wasn't the only one who criticized the withdrawal.

That number is more than double what most experts thought were possible. No nation -- no nation has ever done anything like it in all of history.
