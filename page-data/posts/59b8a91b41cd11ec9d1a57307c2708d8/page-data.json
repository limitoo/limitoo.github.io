Of that, roughly 25,900 tons \\u2014 or more than 57 million pounds \\u2014 of waste, including personal protection equipment (PPE), has ended up in the ocean. Nearly three-quarters of that waste, researchers said, was generated by hospitals.\", \"Along with face masks, gloves and face shields contributing to the problem, researchers found large quantities of packing materials polluting in the ocean and waterways leading to it, as lockdowns and social distancing led to more people shopping online. Packaging materials make up 4.7% of the plastic waste that's ended up in waterways and the ocean since the start of the pandemic, they said.\", \"Researchers found that 46% of the pandemic-related plastic waste was generated in Asia, while 22% came from North and South America combined, and 24% from Europe. They noted a lower level of medical waste treatment and recycling in developing countries such as India, Brazil, and China\", \"The excessive waste can prove deadly for marine ecosystems.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The released plastics can be transported over long distances in the ocean, encounter marine wildlife, and potentially lead to injury or even death,\\\" researchers wrote, noting previous studies and cases where marine life has become entangled or trapped in waste, or even consumed the plastic.\\u00a0\", \"In March, other researchers\\u00a0found that in the Netherlands, a fish was seen trapped in a medical glove. In Dutch canals, birds were observed using face masks as nesting materials.\\u00a0\", \"Researchers predict that plastic waste from the pandemic will have a \\\"long-lasting impact\\\" on ocean ecosystems, with most of it ending up in either the seabed (28.8%) or beaches (70.5%) by the end of the century.\", \"Some of the waste will end up stuck in the massive garbage patches\\u00a0circulating in ocean regions. The Arctic Ocean, which is considered particularly vulnerable because of its high sensitivity to climate change, is a \\\"dead-end\\\" for plastic debris, researchers said.\", \"They urged nations to better manage their medical waste and develop more environmentally-friendly solutions to collect, treat and recycle waste. If not, by the time the pandemic ends, their models predict there will be a total of 11 million tons of pandemic-related plastic waste \\u2014 34,000 tons of which will end up in the ocean.\\u00a0\", \"Li Cohen is a social media producer and trending reporter for CBS News, focusing on social justice issues.\"]","href_hash":"59b8a91b41cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"59b8a91b41cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
