He told the jury that someone could survive only \\\"seconds to minutes\\\" with the type of injuries Wright suffered.\", \"Wright, 20, was killed after being pulled over in Brooklyn Center, a suburb of Minneapolis, for having expired license plate tags and an air freshener hanging from this rearview mirror.\", \"Police tried to arrest him on a previous warrant for a weapons charge, but Wright pulled away from the officers and got back into his car when Potter, 49, shot him, but she said she meant to use a Taser.\", \"Jackson testified that the additional injuries Wright might have suffered when his car drove away and hit an oncoming car after he was shot were unsubstantial compared to the gunshot wound responsible for his death.\", \"The jury was also shown limited autopsy photos and graphic images of Wright's body at the scene.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950635/donte-wright-fatal-gunshot-wound.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">In this screen grab from video, an illustration of the path of the bullet recovered from Daunte Wright's body is discussed by Dr. Lorren Jackson, assistant medical examiner in Hennepin County, Minnesota, while testifying on December 13, 2021, in the trial of former Brooklyn Center Police Officer Kim Potter in Wright's April 11, 2021, death, at the Hennepin County Courthouse in Minneapolis. </div>\", \"Jackson testified that Wright had some cannabinoids, or THC and its metabolites, in his blood from smoking marijuana, but that they didn't factor in his cause of death. Under cross-examination, he testified that the level of THC metabolites in Wright's blood was \\\"on the high end\\\" of numbers he sees, but was still within a normal range for people who use marijuana.\", \"The assistant medical examiner found the body on the ground, with some medical equipment still attached from lifesaving efforts, and some dried blood from the gunshot wound.\", \"The autopsy photos, which Judge Regina Chu limited after Potter's attorneys objected earlier in the trial. Wright's mother, who has been present for much of the testimony, was not in court as the autopsy photos were shown.\", \"Potter, a 26-year police veteran who resigned two days after the shooting, said she meant to draw her Taser. Wright's death, which came while Derek Chauvin was on trial in nearby Minneapolis in George Floyd's death, set off several nights of angry protests in Brooklyn Center.\", \"The video showed the critical moments where Wright pulled away as Anthony Luckey, an officer in training, was on the verge of handcuffing him, followed by Potter shouting \\\"I'll tase you!\\\" and \\\"Taser, Taser, Taser!\\\" and then shooting him once with her handgun.\", \"Jurors saw Potter falling to the ground and wailing immediately afterward, with other officers attempting to console her.\", \"The defense has called the shooting a horrific mistake, but has also asserted that Potter would have been within her rights to used deadly force on Wright because he might have dragged a third officer, then-Sergeant Mychal Johnson, with his car.\", \"Johnson testified Friday that he was holding Wright's right arm with both hands to try to handcuff him, but that he dropped Wright's arm when he heard Potter shout. Video appeared to show Johnson's hands still in the car when the shot was fired.\", \"Prosecutors have argued that Potter had extensive Taser training that included multiple warnings about not confusing it with a handgun. One of them, Matthew Frank, noted that Johnson hadn't drawn either his Taser or gun.\", \"The trial also has included extensive testimony and video from officers who hurried to the scene after Wright's car, moving away from the traffic stop, collided with an oncoming vehicle.\", \"Prosecutors blamed Potter for not immediately radioing details of the shooting so that Wright might have gotten medical aid more quickly; it took about 8 1/2 minutes before officers, uncertain of what they were dealing with, pulled him from his crashed vehicle.\", \"Defense attorney Paul Engh complained that prosecutors were showing too much video that had nothing to do with the shooting of Wright, and requested a mistrial. But prosecutors are seeking an aggravated sentence if they win conviction and have to show that Potter's actions endangered others. Chu dismissed the request.\", \"The case is being heard by a mostly white jury.\", \"State sentencing guidelines call for just over seven years in prison upon conviction of first-degree manslaughter and four years for second-degree, though prosecutors have said they plan to push for even longer sentences.\", \"The Associated Press contributed to this report. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950605/minnesota-kim-potter-trial-daunte-wright.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">In this screen grab from video, the bullet recovered from Daunte Wright's body was a topic of testimony by Dr. Lorren Jackson, assistant medical examiner at Hennepin County, Minnesota, on December 13, 2021, in the trial of former Brooklyn Center Police Officer Kim Potter in Wright's April 11, 2021, death, at the Hennepin County Courthouse in Minneapolis. </div>\"]","href_hash":"ac4f6a545c5211ec86f0c79927e536c4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ac4f6a545c5211ec86f0c79927e536c4"}},
