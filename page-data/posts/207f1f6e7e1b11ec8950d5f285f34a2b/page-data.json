Tensions were too high at home for him to consider footwear. I ran after him with a pair of sports slides. We walked \\u2014 first with me trailing behind, eventually arm in arm, and then finally back home. Twelve years later, we were grown. My husband left me when I was already depressed. As I sobbed in my car, unable to drive, my brother walked two miles to sit beside me in the passenger seat. Some people are siblings; we are co-pilots. \\u2014 Gwendolyn Coburn\", \"\\u201cGood luck with everything, pal.\\u201d That was the final text from the man I thought would be my final love. Five words bent into a flint dagger. My eyes welled and my lips blubbered; sweat soaked through my shirt. Opened and emptied, I stumbled downstairs, knocked on my roommate Adhitya\\u2019s door and asked for an invitation to his bed, where he held me as I choked back heartache. He did not disparage my ex or remind me of my worth. He only cuddled me until my heaving gave and kissed my cheek before I returned upstairs. A pal. \\u2014 Skyler Gordon\", \"Two couples sit on a Central Park bench to discuss an adoption. One of the pairs is seven months along in pregnancy. They watch a squirrel descend a tree and cross the lawn. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s it got in its mouth?\\u201d one asks. \\u201cA baby squirrel,\\u201d I reply. We watch the squirrel climb another tree, scamper down alone, then climb the first tree, descending with another squirrel in tow. We sit in silent awe as the squirrel brings her babies to a new nest. Our daughter is 16 now. \\u2014 Pamela Gross\", \"Last year, I asked my husband to participate in a gratitude challenge. Whenever we felt thankful, we\\u2019d add a note of gratitude to a jar. Matt took the task seriously; I less so. I began wondering if my gratitude \\u201ccog\\u201d was broken and grew worried. Is there anything worse than being married to an ingrate? This January, we reviewed the jar\\u2019s contents: a year\\u2019s worth of mostly Matt\\u2019s notes. \\u201cThis is fun,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019ll be our family tradition.\\u201d It seems he hasn\\u2019t noticed that he\\u2019s married to a curmudgeon, or maybe he doesn\\u2019t mind. Either way, I\\u2019m grateful. \\u2014 Christina Wyman\"]","href_hash":"207f1f6e7e1b11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"207f1f6e7e1b11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
