They\\u2019ll say it\\u2019s all about offering the highest levels of functionality and practicality.\", \"Which is why their next collaboration, released widely on Nov. 10 (and two days earlier at a pop-up shop in New York), is a collection of men\\u2019s, women\\u2019s and unisex clothing for the Canadian technical outdoors brand Arc\\u2019teryx.\", \"\\u201cThere has to be a real reason to do them,\\u201d Mr. Meier said of collaborations. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not just there to create hype. It\\u2019s genuinely things that we like and we feel are complementary to the world of Jil Sander.\\u201d\", \"Though it does help that Arc\\u2019teryx happens to be incredibly hype-y. The brand is a staple of gorpcore, the campwear-as-streetwear look particularly popular among city-dwelling, jawn-copping men\\u2019s wear enthusiasts.\", \"So while the collaboration is designed for skiing, snowboarding and outdoor sports, these pieces may end up being as prevalent in downtown Manhattan as they are on ski slopes. (Like the previous collaborations, this one falls under Jil Sander+, a sub-line of outerwear \\u201cfor going to the mountains or seaside or countryside, where you want things to work and be functional, but you don\\u2019t want to give up your aesthetic,\\u201d Mr. Meier said.) Prices range between $1,500 and $2,500.\", \"Here, in an edited interview from their studio in Milan, where they each wore shades of white against a white Zoom background, the designers talk about their approach to collaborations and how growing up in cold-weather climes (he in Vancouver, she in the Alps) influenced their work with Arc\\u2019teryx.\", \"We\\u2019ve seen so, so many fashion collaborations in the last few years. How do you decide when to seek them out or to say yes when they come to you?\", \"Luke Meier It\\u2019s a good buzzword, right? \\u201cCollaboration.\\u201d It\\u2019s newsworthy \\u2014 people kind of perk up their ears when they hear about a collaboration. We really only want to do things that make sense, to create something that we couldn\\u2019t otherwise do ourselves. So it\\u2019s not purely about working with brands that somehow have a parallel objective for marketing.\", \"We never want to just have two logos on a product. That\\u2019s not really that interesting, to be honest. So whether it was Mackintosh or Birkenstock or now with Arc\\u2019teryx, they\\u2019re all specialty brands. They have a very deep expertise in the things that they do.\", \"With Arc\\u2019teryx, how did the process start?\", \"Luke We would work on the shapes and make patterns, and then we would send it over to their developers, and they would help us engineer the pieces in the right way. So it was very much a product-driven dialogue at the beginning. Obviously we respect the Arc\\u2019teryx aesthetic, but we really wanted to pull it into the Jil Sander world and give it our aesthetic touch.\", \"They were really supportive in walking us through some of the reasons they make things in certain ways. Even if it\\u2019s as simple as some draw cords they have on a coat, for example \\u2014 they never have a loop because it could snag on something. Subtle things like that, that they\\u2019ve worked on over years and years.\", \"But it\\u2019s the same on the other side, where we have people in our ateliers that have been working on Jil Sander pieces for over 20 years, where we have a dialogue with them about the shape of a shoulder or the way certain pieces should fit.\", \"The collection was designed for mountain sports. Hobbies of yours?\", \"Lucie Meier I grew up in Zermatt in a ski resort, so there was no way to escape it. And Luke was spending a lot of winters in Whistler in British Columbia. It\\u2019s something we\\u2019ve been doing since we were children and still really love. As soon as we can get out into the snow and the mountains, we go for it.\", \"Luke We still get at least 20 days a year skiing. Milan is very nicely situated \\u2014 you can get to the Alps really easily, really quickly. We also try to get back to Vancouver once a year, even just to the local mountains in the city, to go night-skiing or something.\", \"So technical winter wear is something you\\u2019ve wanted to do for a while?\", \"Lucie I mean, these kinds of pieces have been part of our life for a long time. It\\u2019s just that we wanted to have the right partner, so we waited until the time was right.\", \"Luke I think it\\u2019s more and more difficult to find really beautiful garments that also work well. It\\u2019s kind of one of the other \\u2014 you can get the really functional things that work incredibly well, but sometimes you feel like you\\u2019re an astronaut or something. You just wish it was a bit more beautiful with a bit more soul, and didn\\u2019t feel so plastic and industrial.\", \"Is there one piece you\\u2019re partial to or that you feel is representative of the collection?\", \"Luke I love the onesie.\", \"Lucie I love the onesie, too.\", \"Say more about the onesie.\", \"Luke It\\u2019s a 3L Gore-Tex full suit, and it\\u2019s somewhat comforting, just to be sealed up, like you\\u2019re not going to have any snow go underneath your jacket hems. There\\u2019s a coziness to something that usually is quite nylon.\", \"Lucie Maybe it\\u2019s nostalgia for childhood. It\\u2019s time to go back into a onesie.\", \"Certainly that desire for comfort is something a lot of people have wanted from their clothes in the last year-and-a-half.\", \"Luke But we always want that \\u2014 even before all of the \\u201chomecore,\\u201d the loungewear, the idea that you\\u2019re sitting at home so you don\\u2019t have to get dressed up. We always want to be comfortable, even wearing a perfectly tailored suit. That\\u2019s really a part of our approach. It\\u2019s not about sacrificing for the look. You should also be able to \\u2014\", \"Lucie \\u2014 to feel good in what you wear.\"]","href_hash":"86c675e841f711ec9b3a000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"86c675e841f711ec9b3a000017025a03"}},
