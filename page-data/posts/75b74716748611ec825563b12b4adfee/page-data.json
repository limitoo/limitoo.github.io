She said she woke up to a pillow pushed on her face and Clinton sexually assaulting her.\", \"According to the police report, the teen was able to push Clinton off of her and then told a friend what happened. She later told her father, who called the police.\", \"In October, Adrian found Clinton guilty of felony sexual assault, but during a January 3 sentencing hearing he said he would not impose the mandatory minimum sentence of four years in prison.\", \"\\\"Mr. Clinton has served almost five months in the county jail, 148 days,\\\" Adrian said, according to the court transcript of the hearing posted online by local media. \\\"For what happened in this case, that is plenty of punishment. That would be a just sentence.\\\"\", \"\\\"There is no way,\\\" the judge explained, \\\"for what happened in this case that this teenager should go to the Department of Corrections. I will not do that.\\\"\", \"But the judge said if he were to rule that the sentencing statute he was bound to follow was unconstitutional, his decision would be overturned and Clinton would be ordered to prison. In order to avoid an appeal he believed would be successful, Adrian said what he could do was determine that prosecutors had failed to \\\"prove their case\\\" and dismiss the sexual assault charge.\", \"The prosecutor in the case, Anita Rodriguez, said she had never in her 40-year career seen anything like Adrian's ruling, and worried how the ruling might affect the victim. The trial \\\"did a lot for her healing process, but now she's back to where we were at.\\\"\", \"The Quincy Area Network Against Domestic Abuse said the ruling sends a dangerous message.\", \"\\\"The judgement reinforces the fact that standards for women have always been impossibly high while they are impossibly low for men,\\\" the group said in a statement.\", \"But Clinton's attorney, Drew Schnack, said the ultimate verdict was the correct one because the prosecution did not prove its case and the evidence was not strong enough to warrant a conviction.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"75b74716748611ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"75b74716748611ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
