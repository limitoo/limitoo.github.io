In Pacifico\\u2019s debut, \\u201cThe Story of My Purity,\\u201d the protagonist is an editor at a hard-right Catholic publishing house; he\\u2019s obsessed with Judaism to the point of antisemitism and with his (literally) virginal sister-in-law\\u2019s breasts to the point of impotence. Pacifico\\u2019s follow-up, \\u201cClass,\\u201d took on the hipster millennials of Italy\\u2019s leisure class, their bank accounts padded by regular cash transfers from their parents, their self-regard padded by the status symbols those transfers afford. The novel\\u2019s first line \\u2014 \\u201cThe personal fulfillment of the bourgeoisie isn\\u2019t worth the carbon footprint required to sustain it\\u201d \\u2014 functions also as a fair summation of its ethos.\", \"Pacifico\\u2019s third novel, \\u201cThe Women I Love,\\u201d finds the writer in a more contemplative, even melancholy mood. While his characters still work in the culture industry and travel in moneyed circles \\u2014 his protagonist, Marcello, is a book editor whose salary was, until \\u201cfour or five years ago,\\u201d supplemented by his father, an angel investor for start-ups \\u2014 they\\u2019re also getting older, feeling the weight of their accumulated years. When Marcello drinks too much, his heart \\u201ctrembles.\\u201d If he\\u2019s not quite ready to settle down, he\\u2019s at least ready to ask the question \\u201cWould we ever settle down?\\u201d\", \"At 34, Lorenzo, one of the feckless strivers of \\u201cClass,\\u201d is still trying to \\u201cmake it\\u201d as a filmmaker; he risks and ultimately wrecks his marriage in the process. Marcello, on the cusp of 40, leaves his job when the work becomes too commercial, allowing him more time with his partner and family. It\\u2019s a turn that suggests a kind of fulfillment \\u2014 emotional, rather than professional or social \\u2014 that might be worth at least the carbon footprint required to document it in a book.\", \"\\u201cThe Women I Love\\u201d is broken into five sections, each named for a woman in Marcello\\u2019s life. \\u201cEleonora\\u201d is the younger editor whose career Marcello shepherds and with whom he cheats on his live-in girlfriend. \\u201cBarbara\\u201d is the live-in girlfriend who becomes, by the end of the novel, Marcello\\u2019s wife. \\u201cDaniela\\u201d is the sister-in-law to whom he grows closer after quitting his job. \\u201cIrene\\u201d is the estranged older sister with whom Marcello reconnects.\", \"The last section, \\u201cMy Mother,\\u201d is written in exquisitely spare, tender prose. (Elizabeth Harris, here especially, translates with a light, graceful touch.) Describing an evening at the theater with his mother, Marcello notes \\u201cthe kinship of our bodies, the same way we both rush to take our seats and then never quite settle in.\\u201d In his previous novels, Pacifico sketched a parental relationship important above all for its financial benefits. His tone here, however, suggests an attitude beyond gratitude, approaching reverence, for the generation that lived through and prospered after the trauma of World War II.\", \"Marcello\\u2019s stated desire \\u2014 what he calls \\u201cthe real point of the book\\u201d \\u2014 is to figure out \\u201cwhat\\u2019s left for a man to write when he\\u2019s writing about women.\\u201d If the male writer\\u2019s goal is to neither render judgment on his female characters nor reduce them to stereotype, \\u201cis there anything left?\\u201d It\\u2019s a telling question for both subject and author, the former trying to do the women he loves justice, the latter attempting, for perhaps the first time, to work in a sincere, rather than satirical, mode.\", \"Pacifico finds his answer in a kind of wistful reportage, striving not to interpret these women but simply to portray them. Marcello\\u2019s mother is not, ultimately, understood; she is, however, seen. Pacifico employs this mode in Marcello\\u2019s self-description as well. When, late in the novel, a sexual encounter that at first seems consensual becomes an assault, he remains largely descriptive, conveying his feelings in the moment without pretending these can excuse his behavior. \\u201cI won\\u2019t,\\u201d Marcello says, \\u201cdestroy the evidence.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWords are the purifying fire,\\u201d Pacifico writes in \\u201cClass.\\u201d \\u201cPurgatory is an area of pure language in which the dead examine, alone but guided by the invisible force of the angels, the shortcomings of their life.\\u201d Pacifico\\u2019s first two novels skewered their characters\\u2019 shortcomings; they were also, notably, narrated at least in part by characters who turned out to be dead. With \\u201cThe Women I Love,\\u201d Pacifico seems to have passed out of purgatory and into a less damning realm, one in which human flaws are to be exposed but also pitied, not mocked.\"]","href_hash":"b25719c2574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b25719c2574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}},
