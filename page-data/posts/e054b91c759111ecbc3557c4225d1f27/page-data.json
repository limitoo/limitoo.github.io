(Parts of that bill, such as a section that tells school boards not to \\u201cteach or incorporate into any course or class any divisive concept,\\u201d have been criticized as overly broad and likely to infringe on the free speech of students and educators.)\", \"Instead, he referred to statements that he and Mr. Williams had made on Townhall, a conservative website. Mr. Merryman told Townhall that Mr. Williams had submitted an \\u201canti-discrimination bill\\u201d that correctly referred to the Lincoln-Douglas debates.\", \"Lincoln and Douglas met seven times in 1858, when Lincoln, a Republican, challenged Douglas for Senate. Lincoln lost the election, but the debates between the two brilliant orators transfixed the country, drew attention to the bitter arguments over slavery and catapulted Lincoln to national fame.\", \"Mr. Williams told Townhall that he was \\u201cfrustrated\\u201d by the error.\", \"\\u201cI have a very high standard for my office, and my service to my constituents and the Commonwealth,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cI trust this was an honest mistake,\\u201d he added, \\u201cand I don\\u2019t hold it against Legislative Services.\\u201d\", \"The mix-up recalled remarks by President Donald J. Trump on the first day of Black History Month in 2017 in which he referred to Douglass in the present tense, leading some critics to conclude that he believed the abolitionist, who died in 1895, was still alive.\", \"\\u201cFrederick Douglass is an example of somebody who\\u2019s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice,\\u201d he said.\", \"The error should not distract the public from the general contents of the bill, which would keep conversations about the United States\\u2019 racial history out of classrooms, said Lara Schwartz, a professor of government in the School of Public Affairs at American University in Washington.\", \"\\u201cIf this so-called divisive concepts bill became law, all of Virginia\\u2019s students would be the worse for it, and ignorance of our history would not just be a sad punchline \\u2014 it would become more the norm,\\u201d she said in an email.\", \"Critical race theory \\u2014 an advanced academic concept generally not introduced until college \\u2014 is not part of classroom teaching in Virginia. But during the statewide race last year, Mr. Williams, 33, a lawyer who worked on Mr. Trump\\u2019s failed efforts to overturn the election results in Wisconsin, said he would ban it in schools if he won.\", \"He won the Republican nomination last June, unseating Charles Poindexter, a longtime legislator in the district, and then won 77 percent of the vote in the November general election, beating Bridgette Craighead, a Democrat.\", \"The bill, the first one introduced by Mr. Williams, is pending in committee and must be passed by both the House of Delegates and the Senate, where Democrats hold a slim majority.\", \"The legislation would forbid school boards or educators to teach \\u201cany divisive concept,\\u201d encourage students to participate in political activism or \\u201cpublic policy advocacy,\\u201d or hire equity and diversity consultants.\", \"The legislation\\u2019s wording \\u201cprohibits teachers from helping students understand the continuing role of racism in the development of American institutions and culture,\\u201d said James Grossman, the executive director of the American Historical Association, which represents more than 11,500 historians. \\u201cIt provides a chilling effect that makes teachers wary of teaching accurate American history.\\u201d\", \"He said the bill had come from the same template as legislation introduced in more than 30 other states that seeks to ban or limit the teaching of \\u201cdivisive concepts\\u201d relating to race and racism in classrooms.\", \"Professor Schwartz said that \\u201cthe fact that there is a basic factual error in this bill has amused many people.\\u201d\", \"She added, \\u201cBut it\\u2019s a distraction from an issue that\\u2019s not funny at all: a wave of state legislation that has the effect and intent of impeding the important conversations that teachers and students need to have in their classrooms.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e054b91c759111ecbc3557c4225d1f27"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e054b91c759111ecbc3557c4225d1f27"}},
