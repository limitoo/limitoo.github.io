He was 74.\", \"The cause was complications of pancreatic cancer, his daughter, Clare Davies, said.\", \"Mr. Davies was a key figure in introducing contemporary Middle Eastern writers to an English language audience, rendering their prose into English with crisp and precise translations rich in nuance and sensitivity to the original. He displayed remarkable breadth, translating nonfiction and medieval works as well.\", \"Mr. Davies translated more than 30 books from Arabic, among them novels by Mr. Khoury, including \\u201cGate of the Sun\\u201d (1998; translated in 2005) and \\u201cYalo\\u201d (2002; translated in 2009), each of which won him the prestigious Banipal Arabic Literary Translation award.
