Chauvin changed his plea to guilty last December. Thao, Kueng and Lane, who could face years in prison if convicted, have all pleaded not guilty.\", \"\\\"For more than nine minutes, each of the three defendants made a conscious choice over and over again not to act,\\\" Trepel told the jury.\", \"\\\"They chose not to intervene and stop Chauvin as he killed a man slowly in front of their eyes on a public street in broad daylight.\\\"\", \"She said that the officers had sworn an oath to care for people in their custody, and were required by law to stop Chauvin and give Floyd medical aid.\", \"Defence lawyers say the three defendants had a duty to arrest Floyd on suspicion he used a counterfeit $US20 bill to buy cigarettes, and were not criminally liable for the conduct of Chauvin, who they deferred to as the most senior officer present.\", \"Earl Gray, a lawyer for Lane, said Floyd was visibly intoxicated when Lane and Kueng first approached him and struggled against being put into the back of their police car.\", \"\\\"He was all muscle,\\\" Gray said. \\\"These two rookies simply could not get this fellow in the back seat and were clearly doing something wrong. So what does Chauvin do? He takes over and he grabs the guy and he puts him on the ground.\\\"\", \"Floyd's girlfriend, Courteney Ross, said during a recess that the defendants were shirking responsibility and trying to blame Floyd for his own death.\", \"\\\"I know that when someone is crying out for help, the right thing to do is help them,\\\" she said.\", \"Prosecutors are seeking to convince the jury in the US District Court in St. Paul that the men wilfully failed to help Floyd during what Trepel called Chauvin's \\\"slow-motion killing.\\\" The indictment says a person under arrest has a right to \\\"be free from a police officer's deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.\\\"\", \"Thao, 36, and Kueng, 28, face an additional count in the indictment, which says they wilfully failed to stop Chauvin using excessive force against Floyd, violating Floyd's right to be free from unreasonable seizure.\", \"Thao had worked for the Minneapolis Police Department for eight years. Lane, 38, and Kueng, who helped restrain Floyd's lower body, had joined only a few months prior, and Chauvin was their field training officer.\", \"Kueng was \\\"a rookie officer\\\" on his third shift ever on the job and was let down by his seniors with \\\"inadequate training,\\\" his lawyer Thomas Plunkett told the jury. Lane would take the stand in his own defence, his lawyer said.\", \"The jury will hear from other Minneapolis police officers that the defendants were trained in how to administer medical aid to people in their custody, and taught that moving Floyd onto his side could have saved his life, Trepel said.\", \"They will also hear from some of the horrified bystanders who shouted at the officers to check Floyd's pulse, Trepel said.\", \"\\\"After Mr Floyd lost the ability to speak, the people on the sidewalk stood up for him,\\\" Trepel told the jury. \\\"They understood just by seeing his body go limp, listening to his words and then listening to his silence that, unless somebody changed what was happening, he would die.\\\"\", \"After the federal trial, the three men face a state trial for aiding and abetting Floyd's murder.\", \"- Reuters\"]","href_hash":"2be258e67dbf11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2be258e67dbf11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
