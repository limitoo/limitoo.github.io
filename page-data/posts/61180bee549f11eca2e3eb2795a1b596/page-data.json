On Friday, the Houston police confirmed that the money appeared to be connected to the 2014 theft.\", \"In a statement on Twitter, the department said that officers responded to a report of property discovered at the church on Nov. 10 and were told by church members that a \\u201clarge amount of money, including cash, checks and money orders\\u201d had been found inside a wall during a renovation project.\", \"Burglary and theft investigators responded and an undisclosed amount of money was inventoried, documented and left in the custody of the church since it had been found on Lakewood\\u2019s property, the police said.\", \"\\u201cEvidence from the recovered checks suggests this November case is connected to a March 9, 2014 theft report of undisclosed amounts of money at the church,\\u201d the police said, adding that the investigation was continuing.\", \"In a statement, Lakewood Church confirmed the discovery.\", \"\\u201cRecently, while repair work was being done at Lakewood Church, an undisclosed amount of cash and checks were found,\\u201d the church said. \\u201cLakewood immediately notified the Houston Police Department and is assisting them with their investigation.

Before the pandemic, the church had been drawing an average of about 42,000 people to services every week, according to a church spokesman.\", \"The 2014 theft from the church\\u2019s safe was discovered by a church employee, a Houston police spokesman told The Houston Chronicle that year.\", \"Lakewood Church said in a statement at the time that the \\u201cfunds were fully insured, and we are working with our insurance company to restore the stolen funds to the church,\\u201d the newspaper reported. The church and Crime Stoppers of Houston had offered $25,000 for information that led to the arrest of those responsible for the theft, according to The Chronicle.\", \"The plumber, who identified himself only as Justin, revealed that he had found the money when he called \\u201cThe Morning Bullpen with George Mo and Erik\\u201d on Thursday.\", \"The hosts had asked callers to share stories of the valuable things they had found and had fielded calls about a lost wedding ring and a $100 bill when they heard from the plumber, according to George Lindsey, a host of the show.\", \"\\u201cIt was the most unique and incredible phone call I have had in my 25-plus year radio career \\u2014 without a doubt,\\u201d Mr. Lindsey said in an interview on Friday.
