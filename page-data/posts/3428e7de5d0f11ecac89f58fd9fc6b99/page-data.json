They're going to start next year.\\\"\", \"Unsworth said he had recently been considering building a commercial shopping centre on the site.\", \"\\\"I had a couple of tenants keen to move in, but then these guys came along and gave me an offer I couldn't refuse.\", \"\\\"I thought, 'do I spend the next three years dealing with council and the issues of trying to get building materials from overseas?'.\\\"\", \"Unsworth was not prepared to reveal how much K\\u0101inga Ora had paid for the site but according to real estate website OneRoof the property recently sold for $2.5 million. He said the sale went through on 22 November.\", \"Toy said K\\u0101inga Ora was currently reviewing the existing plans for the site to assess other potential options for this \\\"large and well-located site near services and schools\\\".\", \"\\\"In \\u014cp\\u014dtiki, we have also recently purchased 155 Ford Street, a large site which we'll redevelop to provide six new two-and-three bedroom homes, replacing the existing older home.\\\"\", \"According to website homes.co.nz the Ford Street property sold on 23 September for $400,000.\", \"\\\"I'm excited we've been able to secure both of these sites for much-needed homes for wh\\u0101nau and tamariki, and we're working as quickly as we can to provide these new homes. We're in the early stages of these housing developments, and once we have more details we'll share them with the community.\\\"\", \"Toy said rumours that K\\u0101inga Ora had also purchased the Nau Mai Motel, which is currently used by the Ministry of Social Development for emergency housing were untrue.\", \"\\\"I can confirm K\\u0101inga Ora hasn't purchased or is looking to purchase the Nau Mai Motel in Whakat\\u0101ne.\\\"\", \"Whakat\\u0101ne mayor Judy Turner said it was fantastic news.\", \"\\\"With our housing shortage, we know that it's across the whole housing sector from high-end housing to affordable housing and rentals at the other end.\", \"\\\"The easy bit, to my mind, is the medium to high-end. You re-zone some land and a developer comes along and develops it and it's all go.\", \"\\\"But my biggest concern is how we are going to supply the affordable end of the market, particularly with the rentals. So I hear about projects like this and it just delights me, because that's exactly the kind of thing we need.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/211080/three_col_LDR-HORIZONTAL-FINAL-colour.jpg?1570666591\\\" alt=\\\"no metadata\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"Local Democracy Reporting is a public interest news service supported by RNZ, the News Publishers' Association and NZ On Air.\"]","href_hash":"3428e7de5d0f11ecac89f58fd9fc6b99"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3428e7de5d0f11ecac89f58fd9fc6b99"}},
