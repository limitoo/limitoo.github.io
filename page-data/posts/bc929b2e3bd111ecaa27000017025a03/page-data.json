The screens of the iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone 13 Pro have a refresh rate of 120Hz, compared to 60Hz on the corresponding iPhone 12 Pro models, resulting in smoother animations and videos.\", \"The new models are also powered by Apple's latest A15 Bionic processor, which is claimed to be faster than the A14 Bionic chip inside the iPhone 12 Pro models, and capable of extending battery life.\", \"Apple also claims to have given its latest iPhone models superior photographic capabilities, through the switch to a larger main sensor and an ultra-wide-angle lens with a wider aperture, both of which are designed to improve low-light results, and a telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, compared to 2.5x on the iPhone 12 Pro models.\", \"Wozniak, who founded Apple with Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne in 1976, further revealed that he couldn't tell the new Apple Watch Series 7 apart from the Apple Watch Series 6.\", \"\\\"I got the new watch, I can't tell the difference,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"I bet you can't tell. Is this a Series 6 or Series 7? You can't even hardly tell.\\\"\", \"However, he also expressed his fondness for the Apple Watch in general, calling it \\\"the most important\\\" device he uses.\", \"\\\"The Apple Watch has become kind of the most important technology in my life,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"I tend to go from the computer that I'm on... to my watch, and I tend to skip all the iPhone stuff.\\\"\", \"He said he prefers to communicate with his voice, rather than by tapping a screen.\", \"\\\"Walking around trying to text, I type into Dvorak for one thing, so the qwerty screen that pops up when you're texting on a phone doesn't work as well for me as some people.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1924229/customer-fifth-avenue-apple-store.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A customer exits the Fifth Avenue Apple Store on September 24, 2021 in New York City.
