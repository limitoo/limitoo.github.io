The Republican-controlled Oklahoma Senate on Thursday approved a half-dozen anti-abortion measures, including a Texas-style ban.\", \"The decision by the Texas Supreme Court turned on whether medical licensing officials had an enforcement role under the law known as Senate Bill 8, and therefore, could be sued by clinics that are reaching for any possible way to halt the restrictions.\", \"But writing for the court, Justice Jeffrey Boyd said those state officials have no enforcement authority, \\\"either directly or indirectly.\\\"\", \"Texas abortion providers did not immediately comment on the ruling but had already acknowledged they were running out of options and that the law would stay in place for the foreseeable future.\", \"Texas Right to Life, the state's largest anti-abortion group, celebrated the decision.\", \"\\\"This is a big victory for the TX Heartbeat Act!\\\" the group's media director, Kimberlyn Schwartz, said on Twitter.\\u00a0 \\\"We have said from the beginning that abortionists' lawsuit should be dismissed, and we're grateful that the law will continue saving thousands of lives.\\\"\", \"The U.S. Supreme Court has signaled\\u00a0in a separate case out of Mississippi that it would roll back abortion rights, and possibly overturn its landmark Roe v.

But that data only tells part of the story, and researchers say the number of Texas women who are going online to get abortion pills by mail has risen sharply.\", \"The Texas law makes no exceptions in cases of rape or incest.\"]","href_hash":"24a575faa16811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"24a575faa16811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
