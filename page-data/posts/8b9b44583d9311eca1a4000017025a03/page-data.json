Greene (R-GA) made serious allegations about the treatment of those arrested following the riot at the Capitol, who are being held at the District of Columbia jail complex.\", \"Appearing on Real America's Voice, Rep. Greene claimed, without providing evidence, that there was a coordinated effort between departments to punish those who were present at the Capitol riot.\", \"She said: \\\"It's the authoritarian nature of the regime. It's not just in the White House, it's not just in Congress, but it's also in serious, serious places like the Department of Justice, the FBI and even in the jail. And what's really scary is also in the courtroom, here in D.C.\", \"\\\"You see what's happening is a political witch hunt and they're using these people to tell all Americans that you need to stay out and you need to stay away.\", \"\\\"But, this isn't the country that we are and I refuse to back down and, you know, it's one thing that we don't agree with what they did on January 6, but we also don't agree to stay silent when there is human rights abuse happening and it's happening at the D.C. jail.\\\"\", \"Rep. Greene later referred to an inspection report at the jail, which was carried out by the U.S. Marshals Service.\", \"She claimed the inspectors found \\\"conditions there did not reach the minimum level allowed.\\\"\", \"The November 2 report did find that the Central Detention Facility at the jail didn't meet the minimum standards required by federal regulations.\", \"It said that 400 inmates would be removed from the jail and would be transferred to the federal prison in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, according to Reuters.\", \"But, inspectors found 120 detainees, including those being held at the treatment facility ahead of their trials for their alleged involvement during the riot at the Capitol, didn't need to be moved.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Problems Only in Central Facility</div>\", \"According to Reuters, the inspection at the treatment facility did \\\"not identify conditions that would necessitate the transfer of inmates\\\" and said the problems it found were limited to the Central Detention Facility.\", \"Rep. Greene has previously voiced support for a Capitol riot suspect who claimed to be \\\"nonviolent,\\\" despite footage appearing to show him attacking police.\", \"She has tried to gain access to the jail on several occasions and has also previously suggested that the January 6 rioters weren't actual supporters of former President Donald Trump.\", \"Rep. Greene said of those who instigated the riot: \\\"The attack ruined our objection [to the 2020 election results] that we spent weeks preparing for, which devastated our efforts on behalf of Trump and his voters.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1920889/rep-greene-speaks-press-after.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Rep.
