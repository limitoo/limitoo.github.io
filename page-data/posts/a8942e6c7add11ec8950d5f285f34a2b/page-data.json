She says she was left naked and handcuffed for 40 minutes\\u2014despite her pleas to officers to allow her to put her clothes on.\", \"\\\"The fact that I continued to ask if I could get dressed. I continued to ask them if I could call someone. What stands out to me most is that I was invisible to them because no one even responded to me saying, 'Yes, you can get dressed later,' or, 'Let us finish this,'\\\" said Young.\", \"The person police were searching for lived next door and was wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet. Police later learned they received bad information from an informant but the damage was done.\", \"\\\"I tell people that I didn't lose my life that night, but I lost a lot of my life that night,\\\" said Young.\", \"\\\"At some point, did you think you could lose your life?\\\" King asked.\", \"\\\"I actually thought that if I had done anything different than what I was doing, I would have died that night. They yelled, 'Put your hands up,' and that's what I did.
