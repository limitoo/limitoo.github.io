The former president leads polls of hypothetical 2024 GOP nominees and his entering the race could convince other presidential hopefuls not to run. However, with Trump out of the race, it's likely several prominent Republicans would battle for the nomination.\", \"During a Wednesday interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump said there are a \\\"couple of people\\\" who would be \\\"very good\\\" candidates for the nomination if he doesn't run.

We have some very good people.\\\"\", \"Throughout the interview, Trump pointed to his strong polling numbers in surveys about potential candidates for the Republican nomination in 2024. Trump also mounts a strong campaign in a hypothetical matchup with President Joe Biden, at times having the advantage and being in a statistical tie with Biden in other polls.\", \"Some potential candidates, including Florida Representative Matt Gaetz and former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, have said that they won't run for president if Trump decides to enter the race. However, Haley may be reconsidering that position.\", \"In October, Haley told the Wall Street Journal that if she decides to run\\u2014a decision she plans to make at the beginning of 2023\\u2014she would call Trump and discuss her plans.
