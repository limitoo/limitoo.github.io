arrested after a raid\\u00a0at the hotel on November 16 but he has not been charged with any drug-related offences.\", \"There are no laws in PNG that prohibit the production, sale or\\u00a0use of methamphetamine.\", \"The case has added fuel to calls to amend Papua New Guinea's Dangerous Drugs Act 1954.\", \"Pang has pleaded guilty to 11 firearms charges and will face court on\\u00a0Friday,
