The Associated Press reported that China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all have overlapping claims.\", \"Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. told AP no one was hurt in the incident Tuesday, but the two ships had to abandon their mission of bringing food to forces occupying the shoal.\", \"The Philippine government expressed to China \\\"our outrage, condemnation and protest of the incident,\\\" Locsin said, adding that \\\"this failure to exercise self-restraint threatens the special relationship between the Philippines and China.\\\"\", \"However, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told AP that the coast guard was trying to uphold Chinese sovereignty, insisting that the Philippine ships had entered Chinese waters without permission.\", \"While the U.S. has no claim to the waterway, military forces have helped patrol the area in the past. President Joe Biden previously assured the Philippines that the U.S. will uphold the two nations' Mutual Defense Treaty.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935624/china-coast-guard-philippines.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Chinese coast guard ships blocked and used water cannons on two Philippine supply boats heading to a disputed shoal occupied by Filipino marines in the South China Sea, provoking an angry protest against China and a warning that its vessels are covered under a mutual defense treaty with the U.S., Manila\\u2019s top diplomat said Thursday.
