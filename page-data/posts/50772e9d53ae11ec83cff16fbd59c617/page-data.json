You may also mutter hush, man, I need to focus on the game, which took place in 1975. That was the year that Jimmy Connors, tennis\\u2019s reigning male champion and very bad boy, strutted onto the grass at Wimbledon to play a competitor he\\u2019d never lost to: Arthur Ashe. Connors had won the tournament the year before and was now its 3-to-2 favorite.\", \"Let me spoil it for you: Ashe prevailed, outplaying and outthinking Connors to become the first African American man to win Wimbledon. The directors Rex Miller and Sam Pollard shrewdly tease this epic showdown at the start of their engrossing, politically astute documentary portrait. By the time they circle back to it, the movie has surveyed Ashe\\u2019s personal life and charted his climb into the tennis stratosphere during Jim Crow. Ashe was already a veteran pioneer by 1975, with numerous wins and milestones. He had become the first Black man to win the U.S. Open. Since then, his ranking slid and, on the cusp of his 32nd birthday, he was a decade older than Connors.\", \"It seems hard to believe, but from what I can tell, \\u201cCitizen Ashe\\u201d is the first full-fledged documentary film on this American legend. The movie site IMDB lists a smattering of television credits, with Ashe\\u2019s name attached in assorted specials and episodes, like his 1969 appearance on \\u201cThe Rosey Grier Show\\u201d and a 1980 guest turn on \\u201cThe Dick Cavett Show.\\u201d There are also some children\\u2019s specials and a couple of TV movies, but that\\u2019s about it. By contrast, I can tick off from memory the titles of several feature-length films that tell the story of Muhammad Ali, both in documentaries like \\u201cWhen We Were Kings\\u201d and in dramas like \\u201cAli,\\u201d Michael Mann\\u2019s fictional consecration starring Will Smith.\", \"The relative paucity of movies about Ashe speaks to who the industry believes worthy of veneration, including which Black heroes. Smith, for instance, is the star of another new movie, \\u201cKing Richard.\\u201d He plays Richard Williams, Venus and Serena\\u2019s coach and patriarch. It\\u2019s the kind of underdog story of struggle and triumph that Hollywood loves to tell, and it gives Smith some juicy scenes in which he chews out and swats away white people who just don\\u2019t get what Williams is doing. Ashe\\u2019s story certainly has moments of great drama and high tension, but, as a sports figure, he inspired decidedly undramatic sobriquets like \\u201cthe gentle warrior.\\u201d This documentary shows you a truer, sharper picture.\", \"You understand why he earned that epithet in the warm, sympathetic \\u201cCitizen Ashe\\u201d and also why there was more to him. In a somewhat too-compressed hour and a half, the movie follows a familiar yet eye-opening trajectory that really takes off when Ashe discovers tennis. His family lived in a house in a segregated park that his father supervised in Richmond, Va. A swimming pool and baseball fields were scattered across the grounds, along with tennis courts, where Ashe watched Black women and men play, and where he soon picked up a racket.\", \"It didn\\u2019t take long for Ashe to win, and win again, inaugurating a career that the filmmakers smoothly lay out with originally sourced and superb archival material. There are some images from Ashe\\u2019s childhood, which are a treat, and of course more photos and footage as the prodigy grew into a dominating force. The movie silkily traces that progression, noting how Ashe\\u2019s formative tennis years were influenced by Dr. Robert Walter Johnson, a physician who mentored Althea Gibson, the first African American tennis player to win Wimbledon. (Rex Miller also directed the documentary \\u201cAlthea.\\u201d)\", \"There\\u2019s much to like about \\u201cCitizen Ashe,\\u201d which at times seems ready (understandably) to succumb to full-fledged hagiography. Ashe was brilliant, he was beautiful, and his widow, Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, is also one of the producers. If the documentary never loses its bite it\\u2019s because the filmmakers know better (Pollard\\u2019s credits include \\u201cMLK/FBI\\u201d). And Ashe\\u2019s story makes it impossible to put a happy face on his achievements. He straddled the color line in his own stubborn, sometimes revelatory fashion, by turns smiling politely, absorbing unbelievable abuse and speaking truth to power as he fiercely, at times delightfully, demolished one white smirk after another.\"]","href_hash":"50772e9d53ae11ec83cff16fbd59c617"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"50772e9d53ae11ec83cff16fbd59c617"}},
