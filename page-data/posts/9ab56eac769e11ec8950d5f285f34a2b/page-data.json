They've lost quite a few whole fingers and various sections of the marina have been ripped off and the fuel jetties sunk, and there's at least 20 piles that are totally gone.\\\"\", \"Lyle said six vessels had sunk, the largest was around 16 metres long.\", \"The initial destruction was caused by one wave, which came through the marina around 11pm on Saturday. It was followed by several surges that continued into Sunday.\", \"The clean-up would require cranes, barges and dive teams and would take some time, Lyle said.\", \"Diesel and oil spills were a risk with sunken vessels and fuel was being removed off some of the at-risk vessels.\", \"Lyle said the geography of the T\\u016bt\\u016bk\\u0101k\\u0101 marina meant it was often affected by tsunami, but this was the worst damage he had seen.\", \"\\\"It's a narrow entrance and an enclosed bay, it's not an estuary so there's nowhere for the pressure to go.\\\"\", \"There is a tsunami warning system in place but Lyle understood marina residents were not alerted before it struck.\", \"No damage has been reported at Northland's other marinas in Whang\\u0101rei, the Bay of Islands or Whangaroa Harbour.\", \"RNZ\"]","href_hash":"9ab56eac769e11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9ab56eac769e11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
