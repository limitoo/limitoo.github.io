In high school, he encountered \\u201ca dangling pink foreskin that I still recall, shaped like the ones on ancient marble statues illustrated in our copy of Will Durant\\u2019s \\u2018The Life of Greece,\\u2019\\u201d and heatedly observed the private parts of identical-twin male cheerleaders, Ted and Fred, turning \\u201ca deep purple\\u201d in a tanning booth at the gym. Granted a closer look at Ted\\u2019s \\u201cheavy, charged-looking\\u201d equipment, of the \\u201cgarden-hose variety,\\u201d he felt his \\u201cmouth go dry\\u201d and his \\u201chands shake.\\u201d Furtive orgasms began to abound.\", \"Though Ivory was a 118-pound teenage weakling uninterested in athletics, an approving steam-room glance from his father, who ran a lumber company, assured the son that his own endowment (cut, a distinction of some socioeconomic preoccupation) was more than adequate. By film school, at the University of Southern California, Ivory was assessing with a connoisseur\\u2019s air a pal\\u2019s \\u201cvery shapely American frat-boy\\u201d arousal, \\u201cto my eye the best of the national norm.\\u201d How did the English travel writer Bruce Chatwin, a later lover, rate? \\u201cUncut, rosy, schoolboy-looking,\\u201d like notes on a fine wine.\", \"Born Richard Jerome Hazen and renamed as an infant by his adoptive parents, Ivory is now 93. There is a wistful defiance to his sexual frankness as a Protestant gay man who came of age in an era of intense repression, as well as the Depression (his mother regularly fed \\u201ctramps,\\u201d he writes, on the family\\u2019s back porch). Throughout his career he felt compelled to underplay the most important romantic relationship of his life: the one with his gregarious producing partner, Ismail Merchant, a Muslim from Mumbai whom he met on the steps of the Indian consulate in New York. Why isn\\u2019t there a plaque commemorating this, wonders Ivory, the recipient of several Oscars, most recently for the screenplay of \\u201cCall Me by Your Name.\\u201d Despite his laurels, Ivory nonetheless seems to have a chip on his shoulder about reductive assessments of the couple\\u2019s variegated oeuvre, like the oft-repeated scoff that they came from the \\u201cLaura Ashley school of filmmaking.\\u201d (All critics are a \\u201clesser form of life,\\u201d he once declared at a luncheon party.)\", \"Merchant and Ivory, normally working with the writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, were one of the most dominant cinematic forces of the late 20th century, rolling out luxuriously appointed adaptations of E.M. Forster and Henry James novels, with the occasional more contemporary anomaly like Tama Janowitz\\u2019s \\u201cSlaves of New York.\\u201d Merchant died in 2005; Jhabvala in 2013. After decades conjuring the Anglo-American aristocracy clinking cups in gardens and drawing rooms, Ivory, the survivor, is ready to spill the tea.\", \"He spills it not in the typical big autobiographical splash but in dribs and drabs: letters, diary entries, tumbling sense-memories of fashion, food and furniture (and the other F-word), with scores of appealingly casual photographs sprinkled throughout. An established master of the slow reveal, Ivory serves gossip with a voile overlay. Contrasting with the homages to men that got away, \\u201cargyle sweater, erections and all,\\u201d are the chapters devoted to Difficult Women like the bombshell actress Raquel Welch, who had the temerity to resist a forceful lovemaking scene; the politically active and litigious Vanessa Redgrave; and the intellectual Jhabvala, whom Ivory saw as a civilizing \\u201cpreceptor\\u201d but never forgave for dissing Merchant-Ivory\\u2019s adaptation of Forster\\u2019s homosexually themed novel \\u201cMaurice.\\u201d It also seems to irk the author that Jhabvala (a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany and mother of three) didn\\u2019t do housework \\u2014 \\u201cRuth never lifted a finger, except to her typewriter\\u201d \\u2014 which, excuse me, but: goals.\", \"I kept thinking that \\u201cSolid Ivory,\\u201d which was edited by the novelist Peter Cameron, amounts to more of a scrapbook of finely wrought prose sketches than the fully carved self-sculpture suggested by its title, whose touching origin story I won\\u2019t spoil. Then, after a little night Googling, I discovered that the bulk of the material was originally published \\u2014 bound in antique silk, naturally \\u2014 by Cameron\\u2019s private press, Shrinking Violet. About a quarter of the material also previously appeared in various publications, from Sight and Sound magazine to a Christie\\u2019s catalog.\", \"It\\u2019s all very effectively spliced together here, but with occasional lapses in continuity, as they say in the movie biz \\u2014 like a journal entry about The New Yorker writer Lillian Ross that fails to footnote her death, in 2017, as if she is still filing \\u201cTalk of the Town\\u201d pieces from heaven (honestly, I wouldn\\u2019t be surprised). Ivory\\u2019s account of hanging out with Ross at her son\\u2019s christening is one of the more enjoyably chaotic in the book, with cameos by a cranky J.D. Salinger, that annoying friend who refuses to pose for pictures commemorating the occasion, and William Shawn, the famously subdued editor and Ross\\u2019s longtime lover, who convulsed with sobs during the ceremony.\", \"We are admitted into the elegant homes of Stephen Tennant, the tarnished Bright Young Thing who was an early proponent of working from bed (\\u201clike some outlandish work of art that you cannot put anywhere,\\u201d Ivory describes him, \\u201cbut which has its own terrible integrity\\u201d); of George Cukor, an early mentor from the Golden Age of Hollywood; and of the itinerant Ivory himself. \\u201cWhat the hell is Susan Sontag doing in my bedroom?\\u201d he forehead-smacks in Paris one night, watching her leaf with presumed judgment through his night-stand reading after a dinner party. And at his Claverack, N.Y., manor, a uniquely Merchant-Ivory storage problem: \\u201cDoes anyone need a gondola?\\u201d\", \"This book does tend to skirt over or even coldly aestheticize unpleasant truths, like the \\u201chalf-burned bits of bodies\\u201d floating past a film crew in the river Ganges; or the fact that Chatwin died of AIDS, not specified here; or even a chauffeur\\u2019s offer of a handshake refused by the vestigial \\u201cnobles\\u201d with whom Ivory, blackballed by college fraternities, found himself consorting after his success. I can\\u2019t quite work out his position on snobbery, and I don\\u2019t think he has either. But I now look at the famous scene in \\u201cA Room With a View\\u201d that so embarrassed me as a young teen, naked men splashing full-frontally at a swimming hole, in a new and dappling light.\"]","href_hash":"235b8d983b4611ecbe2e000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"235b8d983b4611ecbe2e000017025a03"}},
