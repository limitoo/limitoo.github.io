The CFPB lawsuit accuses Cash America West and FirstCash of disobeying the Military Lending Act \\u2014 which caps the annual\\u00a0interest rate on a loan for military personnel or their family at 36%.\\u00a0\", \"CFPB officials said in court documents they warned Cash America in 2013 about overcharging on interest rates but the company kept doing it, even after a merger with FirstCash in 2016. Between June 2017 and May 2021, the combined companies approved more than 3,600 loans to more than 1,000 borrowers with interest rates higher than the 36% threshold, the CFPB alleged in court documents.\\u00a0\", \"FirstCash dismissed the CFPB's allegiations in an emailed statement.\", \"\\\"FirstCash deeply respects members of our military and their families,\\\" the company said \\\"We believe the allegations by the CFPB are without merit. We will seek to engage with the CFPB and respond to the allegations appropriately.\\\"\", \"FirstCash operates more than 2,800 pawn shops across the U.S. and Latin America. The publicly traded company has reported roughly $1.2 billion in revenue so far this year and is valued by the stock market at about $3.1 billion.

Pawn loans are based strictly on the value of a tangible item \\u2014 like a wedding ring or a television set \\u2014 that a person brings to a pawnshop in return for the loan. Pawn shops do not check a person's credit score and the interest rate on pawn loans vary wildly from state to state.\", \"The average pawn loan is about $150, according to 2018 survey\\u00a0data from the National Pawnbrokers Association, the most recent figure the group has.\\u00a0\", \"The stock price of FirstCash fell almost 8% in Friday trading to about $78 a share.\\u00a0\", \"Khristopher J.
