Mitch McConnell,\\\" Ducey told donors. \\\"I consider him an historic figure and one of the Titans of the Senate, and I am supportive of everything he's doing to elect Republican senators and wrest back control from Chuck Schumer.\\\"\", \"Ducey's announcement follows similar decisions by Republican Governors Larry Hogan of Maryland and Chris Sununu of New Hampshire to opt against launching Senate bids despite pressure from national Republicans.
