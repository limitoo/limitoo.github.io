Our members believed that involved a promise to pay full backdating. The proposal that came forward to them did not include full backdating. Our members then said they found that unacceptable.\", \"\\\"We sought sought an alternative legal review of that and that legal review then said based on the documentation, the undertakings been made over the past four or five years, the DHBs were obliged to make a full backdating offer and that hasn't happened.\\\"\", \"Last week, the Health Minister Andrew Little described the nurses' union backtrack on the deal as \\\"peculiar\\\" and said he believed the deal was binding and lawful.\", \"\\\"What's surprising is given the pretty much three years it took to get to a settlement. There's two, two and a half years of technical work. Then a few months of negotiation, and agreement reached in December last year. I'm just surprised that it's taken until [now] to let the DHBs and myself know that they no longer think that it's lawful. There's something peculiar about that.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"88b80a30bf6311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"88b80a30bf6311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
