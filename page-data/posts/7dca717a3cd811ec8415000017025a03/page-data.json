(SANDE Youth, founded in 2008, has been dormant for about five years.)\", \"\\u201cI have spent most of my career trying to advance the marginalized members of our community, generally speaking, but specifically women,\\u201d said Ms. Tipton-Martin, the author of \\u201cThe Jemima Code: Two Centuries of African American Cookbooks,\\u201d and \\u201cJubilee: Recipes from Two Centuries of African American Cooking.\\u201d \\u201cNow I\\u2019m able to actually make that a project that goes on forever.\\u201d\", \"To build the foundation, Ms. Tipton-Martin is working with journalists, including A\\u2019Lelia Bundles, a writer who is also the great-great granddaughter of Madam C.J. Walker. Walker\\u2019s salons \\u2014 which were held at the turn of the 20th century and influenced social change through food and drink, socializing and networking \\u2014 provided some inspiration for the foundation.\", \"Ms. Tipton-Martin will run the organization as a nonprofit, and with the uptick in online conferences and workshops during the pandemic, she plans to make programming available online, in virtual salons, to anyone interested in uplifting and advocating the voices of women in food.\", \"\\u201cCookbooks have always been the space where women could leave a legacy where they can control their own voice and their craft in ways that were acceptable,\\u201d she said. \\u201cSo the idea of inspiring teaching, training up educating the next generation of food writers is important for continuing on that legacy.\\u201d\", \"A videotaped conversation for the Smithsonian that will air on Nov. 12 is an example of the type of programming she hopes to offer. Her foundation will roll out its full schedule next spring, including live and archived discussions and presentations among women writers, writing workshops that focus on skills like recipe development and cookbook writing, and question-and-answer forums.\", \"These salons, Ms. Tipton-Martin said, are designed to explore and elevate women\\u2019s voices in food, untarnished by the longstanding, albeit slowly shifting, legacy of male dominance and exceptionalism in food; to encourage women writers to resist patterns of silence and erasure; and to push back against discriminatory behavior in food.\", \"\\u201cHer work has opened the door for Black women,\\u201d said Psyche Williams-Forson, the chair of American Studies at the University of Maryland, who is on the advisory board for the new foundation. \\u201cWhat she brings to those pages is the beauty, the triumphs, the tragedies, disappointments, the hardships, et cetera, of a Black life that we live. We want future generations to do that as well.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Williams-Forson also believes that the foundation will amplify the longstanding resilience of Black women.\", \"\\u201cMany attempts have been made to silence our voices,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut we\\u2019ve always operated in the culinary world, both out front and behind the scenes.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Tipton-Martin wants the foundation to be a collaborative place, bringing role models together to help the next generation of women in food.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s so much more that we can learn when we care for one another,\\u201d Ms. Tipton-Martin said, \\u201cwhen we share, when we listen, when we befriend one another, and when we see each other through the lens of our shared humanity.\\u201d\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
