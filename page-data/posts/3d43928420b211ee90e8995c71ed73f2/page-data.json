Icon of the Seas' tonnage is more than five times that amount.\\u00a0\", \"The new ship will soon be ready for use, starting in January 2024, the cruise company says, after hitting a milestone last month with the successful completion of its initial round of sea trials. During those trials, the ship was put on the open ocean for the first time.\\u00a0\", \"The ship is divided into eight primary areas:\\u00a0\", \"Icon of the Seas first opened up for reservations in October of last year while the cruise industry was still recovering from the downturn it faced during the coronavirus pandemic.\\u00a0 At the time, prices started at $1,537 a person, but they have since increased by a few hundred dollars.\\u00a0\", \"Royal Caribbean now lists the cheapest ticket at $1,851 for an interior room on a seven-night cruise from Miami to the Western Caribbean in September 2024.
