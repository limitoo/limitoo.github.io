When no one answered the door, officers began inspecting the home and spotted what Orlando Police Chief Orlando Rol\\u00f3n described as a \\\"potential victim\\\" through a bedroom window. Officers then forced the door open and found the three bodies inside.\", \"\\\"We believe a 48-year-old mother and her 16-year-old daughter were killed by the husband and biological father of the child, before the suspect may have committed suicide,' Rol\\u00f3n told reporters during a Friday press conference.\", \"The names of the deceased have not yet been publicly released, nor have details regarding how they died. Detectives said it was not yet known exactly when the three individuals died but said investigators believe it was \\\"within the past few days.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927297/police-tape-florida-suspected-murder-suicide.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Orlando police on Thursday discovered three bodies while conducting a wellness check for a family of three. Above, police tape surrounds an unrelated crime scene on June 23 in the Bridgeport neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois.</div>\", \"According to Rol\\u00f3n, the family of three moved to Orlando over the summer after previously living in New Jersey. The woman's extended family lives in Spain, while the man's extended family lives in Venezuela, Rol\\u00f3n said. The husband and wife moved \\\"unexpectedly\\\" to the U.S. shortly before their daughter was born, and the man had then \\\"restricted\\\" the extent to which his wife could speak with her extended family, he added.\", \"\\\"The suspect very early on restricted the communication his wife could have with her family for many, many years,\\\" Rol\\u00f3n said.\", \"Before the bodies were found, the woman's sister, who lives in Spain, had asked an Orlando-based cousin to check on the family. The woman's sister had told authorities she hadn't heard from the family in \\\"a number of days,\\\" Rol\\u00f3n said. When the cousin didn't get a response at the home, they called authorities to step in, detectives said.\", \"Orlando officers said they believe there is no threat to the community and that they believe this was an isolated incident. Investigators will focus primarily on the family's time in New Jersey due to how recently they moved to Florida, authorities added.\", \"While detectives said there had been no prior police calls to the Orlando home and no \\\"indicators\\\" from neighbors nearby that anything was wrong, authorities said some \\\"red flags\\\" were already beginning to emerge, citing specifically the woman's isolation from her family.\", \"Authorities called upon residents to be aware of those red flags and ask for help if they or someone they know is struggling with domestic violence.\", \"\\\"All people in this country have a legal right to be protected or be assisted when they are in an abusive relationship,\\\" Rol\\u00f3n said. \\\"It doesn't matter what status you have in this country. Those services are available to you.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"b1b8cd023e5d11ec8083837808427722"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b1b8cd023e5d11ec8083837808427722"}},
