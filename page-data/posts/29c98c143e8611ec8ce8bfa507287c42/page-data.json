The company would also add a board member with expertise in aviation, engineering or product safety oversight, and the defendants would pay $237.5 million to Boeing \\u2014 benefiting the shareholders \\u2014 through the directors\\u2019 insurers. The directors being sued denied any wrongdoing.\", \"The lawsuit was filed in a Delaware court last year by the New York State comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, who oversees the pension fund for state employees, and by the Fire and Police Pension Association of Colorado. They accused Boeing\\u2019s board of failing to adequately oversee the company, allowing lapses that led to crashes of the Max in Indonesia and Ethiopia, killing 346 people.\", \"\\u201cThis settlement will send an important message that directors cannot shortchange public safety and other mission-critical risks,\\u201d Mr. DiNapoli said in a statement. \", \"Aviation authorities around the world banned the Max from flight in March 2019 until late last year, when the Federal Aviation Administration approved it again. Since then, the plane has carried out tens of thousands of flights without incident.
