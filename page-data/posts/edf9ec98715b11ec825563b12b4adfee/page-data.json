We see new statues going up, and old ones coming down. But sometimes, we don't even think about the art behind the image.\", \"Ivan Schwartz is a classically-trained sculptor who turned his art into a business, when he and his brother, Elliot, opened their Brooklyn, New York studio, EIS, in 1977.\\u00a0 \", \"From Anne Frank at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans, and Abraham Lincoln seated at Gettysburg, to all of the women represented at the Virginia Women's Monument, the work of Schwartz's team can be seen pretty much everywhere.\", \"\\\"We've done many Lincolns and Washingtons,\\\" Schwartz said, \\\"and now Frederick Douglass sculptures, and Harriet Tubman. \", \"\\\"I often have to sit and think, 'Well, where is that going to begin?'\\\"\", \"CBS News chief Washington correspondent Chip Reid asked, \\\"There's that famous quote from Michelangelo or somebody, 'You just chip away from the marble, whatever does not look like the person.' Makes it sounds so simple. It's not that simple!\\\" \", \"\\\"No, you have to think about what you want to do,\\\" Schwartz said. \\\"And you have to think very hard, because what we're going to wind up with is an inanimate object.\\\"\", \"Schwartz works in a style similar to that of Michelangelo and many other great sculptors: he oversees the work of a team of skilled artists: \\\"These guys can do what I used to do way better than I ever could. It just begins with the vision. I leave the real world, and enter a little fantasy world where I am thinking, 'What are you gonna' do with this person who's been represented so many times before?'\\\"\", \"A monumental hurdle for this particular commission \\u2013 a sculpture of President John F. Kennedy, a new addition to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in celebration of its 50th year, an undertaking funded by billionaire investor and philanthropist David Rubenstein. \", \"Schwartz said, \\\"When you look at pictures of Kennedy, he was smiling, he was the great new president who was on television. And we saw him all the time.\\\"\", \"Young, handsome, and energetic, the public came to know his face, his gestures long before he was immortalized by his assassination in 1963. So, any physical representation of him had to be realistic.\", \"\\\"The client \\u2013 in this case, the Kennedy Center \\u2013 all they told us was that they wanted something that was approachable,\\\" said Schwartz. \\\"So, we all sort of bang our heads together, and then begin looking at the imagery.\\\"\", \"Debra Schwartz is director of projects at Studio EIS, and is sister to Ivan and Elliot. She told Reid, \\\"I would say I looked at 33,000 photographs. And I looked at movies, videos of Kennedy. I went through everything about Kennedy \\u2013 his jacket, his hair, his tie, his handkerchief in his pocket, his shoes, his socks, his cuff links \\u2026 very meticulous.\\\"\", \"And it is this measure of study and observation that makes Schwartz' statues particularly relatable.\", \"Ivan said, \\\"Now, none of us knew this, but as we started watching films, he would constantly touch his coat jacket button.
