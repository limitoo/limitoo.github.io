Officials said the outbreak has largely been tied to the Christmas party, which was held at a restaurant in the city.\", \"The outbreak comes in spite of party attendees having \\\"high vaccination coverage,\\\" the Norweigan Institute of Public Health said Thursday. The spike in new omicron cases comes three days after Norway reported its first two cases of the variant.\", \"According to The Independent, one of the party's attendees had recently been to South Africa, where some of the first omicron cases were discovered.\", \"In a statement, the Oslo Municipality said more cases of the variant are expected in the coming days. However, \\\"effective tracing is being done to limit transmission routes and prevent major outbreaks,\\\" the statement said.\", \"When announcing the outbreak, officials encouraged those who visited the restaurant where the party was held to be tested for COVID-19. A second restaurant, which appears unrelated to the party, was also highlighted as a possible outbreak point and those patrons are also being urged to get tested for the virus.\", \"Scientists are still working to figure out whether the new variant is more contagious and vaccine-resistant.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944342/oslo-norway.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Norwegian officials reported an outbreak of the coronavirus omicron variant after exposure at a company Christmas party in Oslo.

Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere the strictest measures were regional and would apply to Oslo \\u2014 a city of nearly 700,000 \\u2014 and surrounding municipalities.\", \"He said they include working from home when possible, a 100-person attendance limit at private indoor events in public places or rented venues, and restaurants and bars having to register patrons.\", \"Nationally, anyone entering Norway must be tested within 24 hours, either at the border, at a public test station or by self-test. If a rapid test comes back positive, a traveler must take a PCR test within 24 hours, the government said.\", \"\\\"It is likely that the omicron variant will spread in Norway, and that is why the government believes in stricter measures,\\\" Gahr Stoere said. Health Minister Ingvild Kjerkol added that the situation was \\\"worrying\\\" and \\\"we now pull the brake.\\\"\", \"On Tuesday, Norway recommended the use of face masks on public transportation and in shops and shopping malls.\", \"\\\"We still have to keep our distance to get control of the spread of infection, but that does not mean that we cannot have good contact with each other,\\\" Gahr Stoere said.\"]","href_hash":"bb036b6a539d11ec954645b2e7358c71"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bb036b6a539d11ec954645b2e7358c71"}},
