quarantine for two weeks if they get COVID-19.\", \"As will their family, which\\u00a0means partners and their children, or flatmates or grandparents if they live with in the same home and are deemed at risk.\", \"But what about \\\"close contacts\\\" \\u2014 like a teacher or a doctor who comes into contact with someone who gets the dangerous Delta variant?\", \"Queensland Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said \\\"opening up\\\" will only work if the state continues\\u00a0to test, trace, isolate and quarantine.\", \"Well, the jury's out on this as health data and advice keeps changing.\", \"What Ms D'Ath does know is tough stay-at-home orders for the fully vaccinated will remain in force as Queensland battles the worst-case scenario of 1,200 cases a day when borders reopen on December 17.\", \"\\\"All of the advice the Doherty modelling, as well as QIMR's modelling that we have received, says that all of the lifting of restrictions have to operate on the basis we are still testing,\\\" Ms D'Ath said.\", \"\\\"So we expect certainly at the 70 per cent and 80 per cent\\u00a0 [of Queenslanders over 16 that have had two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine] \\u2026 will still be quarantining for 14 days, based on advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee until that advice changes.\", \"\\\"If the advice is you can then quarantine for a shorter period of time, or you do not need to\\u00a0put as many people into quarantine if they are close contacts, then we will take that advice.\", \"<img

jurisdictions had said quarantines and lockdowns may differ for people who were vaccinated.\", \"\\\"People who are fully vaccinated may still be able to go to work if they are a close contact,\\\" she said\", \"\\\"Where, if you are unvaccinated you have to quarantine \\u2014 so we will work through all those things.\", \"\\\"Of course if you are positive, or if a child is sick with COVID and quarantining at home and their parent is a teacher or a doctor, it is up to the parents to make the decision who quarantines with that child.\", \"\\\"But if they have been close contacts, we will take that advice at the time.\", \"\\\"But it may very well be different if you are fully vaccinated, compared to unvaccinated.\\\"\", \"In one of her last press conferences as Queensland's chief health officer, Jeanette Young said double dosed COVID-19 patients would most likely be able to stay at home and recover being managed through a \\\"virtual ward\\\" rather than be forced to go to hospital.\", \"Restrictions and lockdowns in areas with low vaccination rates remain an option, but only as a last resort.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Clear as mud, but nobody's fault</div>\", \"University of Queensland virologist Kirsty Short said there were no clear answers on fully vaccinated infectious people being forced to stay at home.\", \"\\\"Because we also know if you are

quarantine but they would need to take a daily rapid antigen self-test.\", \"\\\"That is a scenario I could see happening then if they tested positive with the test they would have to quarantine.\",

lasts.\", \"\\\"Is that a transient thing or is that protection against transmission going to persist?\", \"\\\"Because that is going to affect how COVID goes through the community?\\\"\", \"She said
