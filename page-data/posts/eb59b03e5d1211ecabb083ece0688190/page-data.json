We are having some success,\\\" Mr Henry said.\", \"\\\"We've also got some producers overseas that will probably supply us with some formulated AdBlue. It is significantly more expensive but critical, it will keep things moving through the summer.\\\"\", \"Already, the prices for AdBlue have quadrupled in parts of the country, prompting the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to investigate \\\"whether an authorisation is needed to allow diesel exhaust fluid producers to share information\\\".\", \"Trade Minister Dan Tehan said on Monday that Australia had\\u00a0around seven weeks' of supply left and was also in talks with trading partners including Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Japan.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Overlooked' supply chain item</div>\", \"Australia consumes\\u00a0between\\u00a0130 million and 150 million litres of AdBlue a year, and Queensland-based AUSblue is responsible for about half of that supply, according to Mr Henry.\", \"He said urea was now \\\"the Achilles' heel of the Australian economy\\\".\", \"\\\"In many ways, it's such a benign material that's almost overlooked,\\\" he said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Perfect storm' for a global shortage</div>\", \"Mr Henry\\u00a0said although AdBlue was\\u00a0not a dangerous chemical, maintenance work at multiple urea plants, COVID-related shipping constraints, and rising diesel\\u00a0consumption had created a \\\"perfect storm\\\" for a shortage to occur.\", \"\\\"Multiple producers of urea are either shut down or in maintenance or they have been directed by their respective governments to focus on their agricultural urea market,\\\" he\\u00a0said.\", \"Domestically, Brisbane-based manufacturer Incitec Pivot, which produces urea suitable to make AdBlue, is also carrying out maintenance work.\", \"Mr Henry\\u00a0said his company had about\\u00a02,000 tonnes of urea\\u00a0in its warehouses.
