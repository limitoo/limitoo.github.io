However, the study said if the city were to add roofs made out of materials that won't absorb heat, also known as \\\"cool roofs,\\\" on even a third of the buildings in the area, it could save them as much as $280 million a year.\", \"Moreover, if the city were to plant enough trees to cover a fourth of the city, creating a \\\"canopy\\\", plus adding the \\\"cool roofs\\\" to all the buildings, they could save billions over the next three decades.\", \"Phoenix's summers are hot, expensive and dangerous. Currently, heat-related illnesses account for $7.3 million in hospital bills, according to the study. In 2020, Phoenix's Maricopa County reported 323 heat-related deaths.\", \"It's not uncommon for streets and highways in Phoenix to warp and crack from the intense heat. Because of that, it costs over $100 million annually to maintain them, mainly due to the extreme temperatures.\", \"Climate change is making Phoenix's summers even hotter. In early September, temperatures reached 111 degrees. Over the summer, temperatures reached 118 degrees. Phoenix recently broke a new November record reaching 25 days of 80-degree temperature, the previous record was for 24 days in 1949, US News reported.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947099/phoenix-heat-relief-station.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A new study released from The Nature Conservancy Monday said the city of Phoenix could save billions of dollars from their scorching summers by planting more trees and using \\\"cool roofs\\\" that don't absorb the sun's heat.
