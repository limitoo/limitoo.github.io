You should, too.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-03T14:01:58.000Z","content":"[\"Six years ago, Eric Adams, then Brooklyn borough president, stood onstage at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn and thundered his commencement advice at the soon-to-be graduates.\", \"He exhorted them to \\u201creach for the stars.\\u201d \\u201cYou are lions,\\u201d he told them. They should always say to themselves, \\u201cI am possible.\\u201d\", \"But, he warned them, while you\\u2019re doing all that, do not forget, \\u201cWhen you play where the big boys and the big girls play, everything you do people watch.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cPeople look at your presentation before they take you seriously,\\u201d he said. \\u201cEverything about you must say power.\\u201d\", \"On the first Tuesday in November, as he strode to a podium in Brooklyn to declare victory in New York City\\u2019s mayoral contest, becoming the second Black mayor in the city\\u2019s history and chief of the power playground, Mr. Adams modeled exactly what that meant \\u2014 as he has been doing since he began his climb toward Gracie Mansion. His white shirt was so pristine it practically glowed; his collar open; his cuff links closed.\", \"\\u201cWhether he\\u2019s talking or not, he\\u2019s always saying something with his dress,\\u201d said George Arzt, a Democratic political consultant who was also Ed Koch\\u2019s press secretary. \\u201cAnd it\\u2019s: \\u2018I\\u2019m here. I\\u2019m in charge. I mean business.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s unusual for city politicians to engage with questions of image-making. Most often, they actively avoid personal discussions of dress, believing it makes them seems frivolous or elitist. If they do connect with the fashion world, it is usually as an economic driver of the city or as the garment district: Michael Bloomberg handing Ralph Lauren a key to the city for investing millions in new stores; Bill de Blasio welcoming the industry to Gracie Mansion before fashion week. It\\u2019s usually just about business.\", \"Not for Mr. Adams.\", \"As he proved when he wore a bright red blazer to a Hamptons fund-raiser in August, or posted a photograph of himself in a new tower with the city\\u2019s skyscrapers spread out at his feet, his aviators reflecting the girders and gleam of the building, he is more than willing to use his clothes to stand out.\", \"And as the 61-year-old assumes his role as the mind \\u2014 and face \\u2014 of the city, a chaotic amalgamation of identities, politics, problems and possibility, at a time when New York is still recovering from a Covid-19-induced economic and spiritual nadir and after the social justice protests of 2020, he will become one of the most visible men in the metropolitan area. He can suffer that, or he can use it to his own ends.\", \"\\u201cHe manages to appeal to a lot of different people with a lot of different expectations,\\u201d said Nancy Deihl, the chair of the art department at the New York University Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development. \\u201cHe\\u2019s really dressing for that.\\u201d It is a strategic deployment of dress that goes far beyond respectability politics into what might be called charisma politics.\", \"He is, Mr. Arzt said, a mayor \\u201cfor the visual age.\\u201d\", \"There are still questions about Mr. Adams\\u2019s specific plans for New York and how he intends to accomplish them, but in this one area at least he has always been absolutely clear: What you wear matters. It has meaning and import. And throughout his career he has crafted his own presentation to bridge communities and interest groups, to assert his place in the room \\u2014 and beyond.\", \"Just over a decade ago, when Mr. Adams was a state senator in Albany, he actually orchestrated a campaign featuring clothes.\", \"The goal wasn\\u2019t a run for office, but rather to get the male members of his constituency to stop wearing pants that appeared to be sliding down their underwear. Complete with posters and a video, it was called \\u201cStop the Sag.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYou can raise your level of respect if you raise your pants,\\u201d Mr. Adams said in the video, wearing, The New York Times reported, \\u201ca gray suit, green tie and white pocket square\\u201d and framing the low-slung pants by contrast as participating in \\u2014 and helping perpetuate \\u2014 a continuum of offensive racial stereotypes that stretched from Aunt Jemima through minstrel performers.\", \"As to why any of this mattered, he told the paper, \\u201cThe first indicator that your child is having problems is the dress code.\\u201d\", \"Ultimately, he said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s all in the clothing.\\u201d\", \"Since then, clothing has played a key role in much of his public storytelling, where he uses it as a sort of universal shorthand, a shared language almost anyone can understand. Reciting his personal narrative, for example, he described taking a garbage bag of clothes to school in case his family was evicted while he was away (clothing as a symbol of homelessness). Commemorating his 22-year career as a policeman in his Twitter bio, he wrote, \\u201cI wore a bulletproof vest to keep my neighbors safe\\u201d (clothing as a symbol of the positive side of law enforcement). Dramatizing a life lesson, he told an apparently borrowed story about confronting a rude neighbor who ignored him until he donned a hoodie (clothing as symbol of racial prejudice and threat).\", \"And celebrating his electoral victory, he said, \\u201cToday we take off the intramural jersey, and we put on one jersey: Team New York\\\" (clothing as symbol of unity).\", \"\\u201cHe clearly knows a lot more about the subject than the average politico,\\u201d Alan Flusser, a tailor in New York and the author of \\u201cClothes and the Man,\\u201d said of Mr. Adams. As to how he learned it, Mr. Adams said his role model growing up was his uncle, Paul Watts, a longshoreman who was always in \\u201ca hat, nicely pressed suit and shined shoes,\\u201d as well as his local pastors \\u2014 though he has taken their lessons and made them entirely his own.\", \"According to Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, a state assemblywoman and chair of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, \\u201cEric\\u2019s style has evolved along with his career\\u201d \\u2014 from police chief with an actual uniform to Brooklyn borough president with a quasi-uniform in the shape of the position\\u2019s official nylon jacket to today.\", \"Now, Ms. Hermelyn said, \\u201cHe\\u2019s projecting New York City as the capital of the world through his wardrobe. But he\\u2019s also saying he grew up on these streets.\\u201d\", \"Indeed, there are a number of stories embedded in Mr. Adams\\u2019s current shirts and suits and accessories of choice.\", \"Mr. Adams got his ear pierced in July after winning the Democratic primary because, he said, he had met a young man during the campaign who expressed doubt over whether any politicians keep their promises. When Mr. Adams asked what he could do to prove him wrong, the young voter said he could agree to pierce his ear if he won \\u2014 and then actually follow through.\", \"\\u201cDay 1, living up to my promises,\\u201d Mr. Adams said in a video of the experience. Now he wears a diamond, which serves as winking symbol of his commitment. But also an effective counterpoint to his perfectly tailored suits, one button often neatly done up to smooth the line, which both advertise his fitness (famously achieved in part by going vegan after a being diagnosed with diabetes) and put him squarely in the tradition of Wall Street power brokers.\", \"\\u201cHe wears clothes in a modern way,\\u201d Mr. Flusser said \\u2014 closefitting, in the vein of Daniel Craig as James Bond, often without a tie \\u2014 \\u201cbut with classic flourishes from the past: shirts with cutaway collars, pocket squares.\\u201d Details, Mr. Flusser said, \\u201cidentified with the highfliers.\\u201d\", \"Indeed, Mr. Adams is so detail-oriented in his dress that his decision to largely abandon the tie (except at debates, where he favored a four-in-hand knot with center dimple) was clearly deliberate, another visual clue that plugged him into the evolution of the modern male dress code. Also notable is the \\u201cenergy stone bracelet\\u201d he wears on his right wrist, composed of stones from Asia and Africa that supporters gave him, and his propensity for a white shirt.\", \"\\u201cThe white shirt is a really powerful image,\\u201d said Ms. Deihl of N.Y.U. \\u201cIt conveys impeccability, crispness and currency.\\u201d\", \"Together, she said, it all lays claim to a visual genealogy that extends from Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr. through to President Barack Obama, whose black aviator Ray-Bans Mr. Adams adopted.\", \"\\u201cAfter I saw President Obama wearing a similar pair, I decided I needed these to make myself look cool \\u2014 Obama cool,\\u201d he told New York Magazine\\u2019s Strategist. (Other preferred brands include Florsheim Berkley penny loafers, Joseph Abboud chinos bought from Men\\u2019s Wearhouse and shirts from Century 21.)\", \"Given that clothes are the unspoken and unwritten way we signal to the world our membership in a group, be it caste or class or profession, this particular collection of styles and names offers a medley of associations that allow Mr. Adams to be a master of the universe, a next-gen executive, a representative of the wellness contingent and the street-smart local, all at the same time. It\\u2019s a button-pushing balancing act that reflects both his chameleon-like politics and ambitions. For himself and his new role.\", \"\\u201cPart of the challenge here is perceptual \\u2014 that New York is on the decline, that it is not healthy, that it is not safe,\\u201d said Evan Thies, one of Mr. Adams\\u2019s senior advisers. He noted that Mr. Adams \\u201cconnects dress with confidence\\u201d \\u2014 in himself and now, by transference, his city.\", \"His job is changing that impression. If he can do that through not only policy but (at least to start) sheer force of image \\u2014 the \\u201cbroken windows\\u201d theory made personal, all wrinkles ironed out \\u2014 he may not just have won the election, Mr. Thies said, but \\u201chalf the game.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"80dbfda43cae11ecae45000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"80dbfda43cae11ecae45000017025a03"}},
