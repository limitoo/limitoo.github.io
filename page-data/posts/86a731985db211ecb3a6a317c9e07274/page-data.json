The Peloton bike sits awkwardly in the passageway between the primary bathroom and dressing area, unused and already collecting dust.\", \"The pandemic status symbol, which customers once waited two months to get their hands on, may soon become the modern equivalent of the 1990s NordicTrack: a high-priced piece of exercise equipment that becomes a glorified clothing rack, cluttering up a home until it is sold or dispatched to the curb.\", \"Signs of its cultural downfall are hard to ignore. Sales of Peloton\\u2019s stationary bikes and treadmills fell 17 percent year over year in the third quarter of 2021, and the online resale market is flooded with used bikes selling at a discount.\", \"Peloton\\u2019s appearance as an ill-fated plot device certainly doesn\\u2019t help. This past weekend, one seller posted an Instagram story showing his being bike carted off with the good-riddance caption, \\u201cAnd Just Like That \\u2026\\u201d\", \"(Also this past weekend, Peloton responded to the negative publicity with a cheeky ad starring Chris Noth, the actor who plays Mr. Big, relaxing in front of a fire with his character\\u2019s favorite Peloton instructor. \\u201cAnd just like that \\u2026 he\\u2019s alive,\\u201d the company wrote on its Twitter account.)\", \"Like thousands of professionals during the early days of the pandemic, Laura and Charlie Weisman, a couple who live in Downtown Brooklyn, bought a Peloton when their gym, Chelsea Piers Fitness, closed during the lockdowns.\", \"\\u201cWe needed an outlet to work out,\\u201d said Ms. Weisman, 31, a new business executive at a digital marketing agency. She paid $1,895 for the original model, plus another $250 for the accessories package (shoes, weights, earbuds, heart rate monitor) and $39 for monthly access to online classes. Ms. Weisman recalled a conversation with her father, who told her the bike would gather dust a year from now. \\u201cI said, \\u2018No way, this is the coolest thing. It will last forever.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"But sure enough, \\u201cas soon as we were vaccinated\\u201d and the gyms reopened, she said, the couple stopped using their Peloton. \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t feel like it\\u2019s necessary anymore,\\u201d she added.\", \"Two weeks ago, the Weismans posted it on Facebook Marketplace, initially asking $1,350 for the bike, plus the Peloton-branded accessories. When no one bit, they lowered the price to $1,200; it sold last weekend to a woman who bought it for her teenage daughter.\", \"While a quick sale may suggest that Pelotons are holding their value, it is worth noting that many were bought at the height of the pandemic, before the company slashed its prices. The base model, which originally retailed for $2,295, now sells for $1,495. (The Bike+, which was introduced in 2020 and has a screen that swivels and can be used for yoga and strength training, sells for $2,495.)\", \"Now, those base models are being resold on sites like Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace and eBay, with some selling below $1,000, according to recent searches.\", \"\\u201cWe recently downsized our apartment and the Peloton no longer fits,\\u201d reads one typical ad on Craigslist in Brooklyn. The seller is asking $800 for a Peloton bike and two pairs of cycling shoes. \\u201cHas probably been ridden 10 times.\\u201d\", \"Kisha Anderer, 42, a stay-at-home mother in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn, hopes to get $1,500 or $1,600 for her Peloton bike, but admitted, \\u201cI wish I would have sold it over the pandemic,\\u201d when the bikes were as hard to find as toilet paper.\", \"Ms. Anderer received her bike as a birthday gift from her husband in 2017, and estimates she used it eight to 20 times a month at first. But after an unrelated neck injury two years ago, it has only cluttered up her TV room.\", \"\\u201cMy husband is on me \\u2014 he asks me every month, are we getting rid of this thing or not?\\u201d Ms. Anderer said. \\u201cI\\u2019m just dragging my feet because it seems like a cumbersome thing to do. It\\u2019s a heavy piece of equipment. It would take a man with a van and three people to get this thing out of my house.\\u201d\", \"One striking thing about the secondhand ads is how so many bikes are described as \\u201clike new\\u201d or \\u201cbarely used\\u201d \\u2014 a sales tactic, perhaps, but perhaps not. Jeffery Rum, 42, who lives in Potomac, Md., and owns a marketing agency, said he has used his Peloton \\u201cless than 30\\u201d times since buying it in 2019. He listed it on Facebook Marketplace for $1,200 (mat included).\", \"\\u201cThe Peloton was going to complement the workouts I was doing during the week,\\u201d with his trainer, Mr. Rum added. Instead, the bike took up residence in his home office, so he had to look at it everyday, sitting there as a nonfunctioning object. \\u201cIt certainly became a sculpture,\\u201d Mr. Rum said with a laugh.\", \"Mr. Rum said he has had several \\u201cnibbles,\\u201d but only from buyers offering as little as $750 and $900. He\\u2019s not ready to sell at that price yet.\", \"The Peloton reminded him of another piece of exercise equipment that his father bought from an infomercial in the early \\u201990s, when he was still living at home. \\u201cIt was called the Ab Roller,\\u201d Mr. Rum said.\", \"And what became of it?\", \"It ended up in the laundry room, he said: \\u201cIt was something that the clothes got folded on.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"86a731985db211ecb3a6a317c9e07274"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"86a731985db211ecb3a6a317c9e07274"}},
