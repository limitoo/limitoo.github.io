This includes people who did not have severe illness initially.\", \"Such\\u00a0longer-term symptoms\\u00a0can affect multiple systems in the body. This can result in ongoing, severe fatigue plus a wide range of other symptoms, including pain, as well as breathing, neurological, sleep and mental health problems.\", \"So far, Australia has had far fewer COVID-19 cases than many other nations. But as we\\u00a0re-open, this situation may change. So we will likely see more long COVID in the months and years ahead.\", \"Our research, which we posted\\u00a0online as a pre-print\\u00a0and so has yet to be independently verified, examined the shifting burden of disease of COVID-19 as Australia re-opens and as high vaccination rates reduce mortality and severe illness.\", \"We show how long COVID will increasingly drive the burden of COVID illness, even as death rates decline.\", \"We\\u00a0also estimate\\u00a0the likely numbers of long COVID cases we can expect in Australia over the two years following reopening.\", \"We wrote this\\u00a0briefing paper\\u00a0before the rise of Omicron, the impact of which we're yet to fully understand.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Here's what we did and what we found</div>\", \"We examined the 2021 Delta outbreaks in\\u00a0Victoria\\u00a0and\\u00a0New South Wales\\u00a0in which nearly 140,000 people had been infected by the end of October.\", \"We estimated long COVID prevalence using two sources. A large dataset\\u00a0from the UK\\u00a0found more than 13 per cent\\u00a0of people had symptoms after 12 weeks. A much smaller study\\u00a0conducted in NSW\\u00a0found about 5 per cent had symptoms over roughly the same period.\", \"Our modelling suggests, by the end of October, the combined Victoria and NSW outbreaks may\\u00a0have already led to\\u00a09,450 to 19,800 people having developed long COVID that could last 12 weeks after their COVID infection.\", \"Even more will have experienced long COVID symptoms for a shorter time: 34,000 to 44,500 people will likely have symptoms for at least three weeks after first becoming ill, but our model indicates more than half will then recover over the following nine weeks.\", \"We also estimated the likely consequences for long COVID if we follow Australia's national re-opening plan, based on interim modelling from the\\u00a0Doherty Institute, which has since been updated.\", \"The Doherty Institute modelled various scenarios with different vaccination rates and public health measures in place. These gave different estimates of COVID-19 cases. We combined these with our upper and lower estimates for long COVID prevalence.\", \"We calculated that more limited relaxation of public health measures could generate 10,000 to 34,000 long COVID cases (people with symptoms lasting at least 12 weeks). More complete relaxation of public health measures could lead to 60,000 to 133,000 long COVID cases.\", \"Based on the longer-term UK data for long COVID prevalence, we calculated 2,000 to 11,000 people might still be sick a year after their initial infection.\", \"What we cannot be absolutely certain about is the impact of vaccination on the expected number of long COVID cases. Some studies suggest that if vaccinated people become infected, this reduces their chance of developing long COVID, but\\u00a0the evidence remains uncertain.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/cef61d4d0ce1f828c60d5ac8d143cb5c\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Study shows ICU COVID patients still suffering symptoms six months on</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Many impacts, beyond health</div>\", \"Long COVID can be a debilitating and distressing health condition. It also has a number of economic impacts, for the health system and people's ability to work.\", \"For instance, people with long COVID require\\u00a0coordinated care\\u00a0across a range of different health services and specialties.\", \"Recent data from the UK's\\u00a0Office for National Statistics\\u00a0indicate that around 1.2 million people reported long COVID symptoms in the four weeks to the end of October. The UK health secretary\\u00a0said he was alarmed\\u00a0at the growing scale of this problem for the National Health Service.\", \"Indeed, attempts to provide long COVID care through specialised hospital-based clinics in the UK and elsewhere have led to\\u00a0long waiting times and uneven access.\", \"By contrast, Australia needs to\\u00a0focus urgently on\\u00a0identifying and counting long COVID. It also needs to establish mechanisms to coordinate care for long COVID by mobilising resources across the community and private sectors, not just public hospitals.\", \"Meeting the emerging needs of people with long COVID represents an additional burden on health-care systems\\u00a0already battered\\u00a0by COVID and rapidly rising backlogs of care for other conditions.\", \"If health-care workers are\\u00a0particularly at risk\\u00a0of long COVID as some people claim, this will further stretch health systems as they take time out to recover or leave the workforce.\", \"Beyond health care, long COVID again highlights weaknesses which were made clear early in the COVID-19 pandemic, but which have not yet been remedied.\", \"COVID-19 has\\u00a0more severely affected\\u00a0those who are socially and economically disadvantaged, and who rely on insecure employment. We expect long COVID to continue to be over-represented in this already disadvantaged population.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/72f313d9f7f5c33fbe32f5bf4d22d280\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Why we hear about some COVID-19 variants more than others</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Avoiding COVID-19 in the first place</div>\", \"While societies around the world grapple with addressing the types of disadvantage the pandemic has exposed, there are several steps individual people can take to minimise their risk of long COVID.\", \"Obviously, this means minimising your risk of COVID-19 in the first place. This means vaccination, mask wearing where appropriate, and complying with other public health measures.\", \"Meanwhile, if you test positive for COVID-19, isolate early, rest and do not return to work until you have fully recovered.\", \"Martin Hensher is\\u00a0 Associate Professor of Health Systems, Financing and Organisation and Mary Rose Angeles is an Associate Research Fellow in Health System Financing and Sustainability at\\u00a0Deakin University.\\u00a0This piece first appeared on The Conversation.\"]","href_hash":"f775bb335de511ec88b9511de08d1ced"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f775bb335de511ec88b9511de08d1ced"}},
