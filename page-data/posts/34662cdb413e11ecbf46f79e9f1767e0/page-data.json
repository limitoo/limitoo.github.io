The work on the house itself had not properly started.\", \"\\\"I get people all the time, you know if I'm in the supermarket or wherever, walking down the street, people expecting that insurance paid for everything and we're back in our house now and it's fine a year later. Well I'm afraid not, it's just not that simple and it's not really a happy story yet - it is going to be because I'm not going to give up on it.\\\"\", \"His family had moved back to the suburb, in a nearby house, having lived in several properties since the flood.\", \"On the other side of Mataruahou or Napier Hill, Paul Matthews' backyard has only become messier since last year.\", \"He had to cut trees down that were an imminent risk.\", \"\\\"I've paid to have all those trees dropped, but I had to have them dropped on top of my mess, so now I've got seven or eight large trees on top of my landslip.\\\"\", \"Progress was slowly being made, even if part of that was the house being deemed a write-off.\", \"He thought the process might take five to 10 years.\", \"He was renting a house in the city, while spending time at his own home most nights after work and at weekends.\", \"\\\"I'm committed to the fact that I have to get on and clean up and stabilise the land I don't know about rebuilding just yet, I don't even know how much I'm in for yet.\\\"\", \"Napier Mayor Kirsten Wise remembered the pressures of last year all too well.\", \"\\\"As a first term mayor, declaring a state of emergency just after 12 months of being in the role isn't something that's high on your bucket list, I would have to say.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/248188/eight_col_RNZD2548.jpg?1604980880\\\" alt=\\\"Napier flood - house\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nThe flooding in Napier last November. \\nPhoto: RNZ / Dom Thomas\\n</div>\", \"Just over a week ago, there was a blast of heavy rain and thunderstorms which filled her with trepidation.\", \"\\\"When we do get a big dump of rain, it's only natural that our community and particularly those who were significantly impacted are going to be very concerned and quite anxious.\\\"\", \"The Napier City Council planned to spend more than $40 million to upgrade the stormwater system.\", \"But Wise feared the three water reforms from central government would upend that.\", \"\\\"That is the real concern that we have here in Napier, and particularly because the central government model that they have put on the table actually has a fraction of the investment planned in our three waters compared to our own plan that we have.\\\"\", \"The council also wanted residents to keep a watchful eye on matters at their own homes.
