Then a pro-regime crowd, scores strong, surrounded his home to shame him. He secretly secured a visa for Spain, he said, and contacts whisked him first to a safe house, then to Havana\\u2019s airport.\", \"And just like that, Mr. Garc\\u00eda, one of the rising stars in the opposition demonstrations that have rocked Cuba this year, was gone.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not made of bronze or marble, and I am not riding a white horse,\\u201d Mr. Garc\\u00eda, 39, told reporters at a news conference in Madrid on Thursday, a day after his arrival, saying he feared imprisonment and didn\\u2019t want to be a martyr. \\u201cI am a person who is afraid, with fears and with worries.\\u201d\", \"It was a dispiriting loss \\u2014 some even called it a betrayal \\u2014 for Cuba\\u2019s pro-democracy protesters who had managed to channel decades of anger over economic failures and desperation caused by the pandemic into a moment not seen before on the island: a movement on the streets, organized on smartphones and social media, that drew Cubans by the thousands to demand change.\", \"But that all came to a halt on Monday when state security agents scuttled a nationwide protest. And days later, one of the movement\\u2019s best-known leaders, Mr. Garc\\u00eda, was sitting in Spain.\", \"To many, Mr. Garc\\u00eda\\u2019s predicament heralded a return to the Cuban government\\u2019s playbook of suppressing dissidents, which reached heights in the 1980s and 2000s. Critics were intimidated into fleeing the country, or in some cases, forced out.\", \"\\u201cThere is this kind of recurring, cyclical phenomenon: discredit those voices, silence them, intimidate them,\\u201d said Katrin Hansing, an anthropologist at Baruch College in New York who studies Cuba.\", \"But this new generation of exiles is different.\", \"They are young writers, artists and musicians who, for a time, were encouraged by Cuba\\u2019s opening up, even promoting their talents to the world.\", \"Less than a decade ago, Cuba\\u2019s leaders talked of a need for change, even for limited criticism of the system. The country eliminated the exit visa, allowing Cubans to travel without official permission and letting a younger generation pursue education abroad. It made a deal with the United States to reestablish ties, with provisions to expand the flow of information.\", \"Hamlet Lavastida, a 38-year-old Cuban artist, was among those who had taken advantage of the loosened restrictions. After living in Poland for several years, he went to Germany in 2020 to take up an artist residency. His work often took aim at the Cuban state: In May, he exhibited a piece made of cut-out paper that included another Cuban artist\\u2019s confession under interrogation by the authorities.\", \"After Mr. Lavastida returned to Havana in June, the authorities arrested him and took him to an interrogation facility where he was held for three months without charge. He said he contracted Covid-19 there, with agents repeatedly questioning him about his artwork and saying he was a terrorist.\", \"\\u201c\\u2018Do you know who Tony Blinken is?\\u2019 they would ask,\\u201d said Mr. Lavastida, referring to Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state. Cuba\\u2019s government has accused the dissidents of acting on behalf of the United States, which it says is fostering unrest to overthrow the government.\", \"In September, the government forced Mr. Lavastida on to a plane bound for Poland, where he has a son. Now back in Berlin, he was charged in Cuba this fall with incitement.\", \"M\\u00f3nica Bar\\u00f3, a 33-year-old independent journalist who left Cuba this year for Madrid, said the recent pattern echoed the Black Spring crackdown of 2003, when the government imprisoned 75 dissidents and journalists.\", \"This time, however, the government is using tactics that attract less media attention, Ms. Bar\\u00f3 said. For example, rather than sentencing government critics outright to prison, the authorities have detained them for stretches at a time, in an effort to \\u201cdestabilize everyone emotionally \\u2014 you and your family,\\u201d she said.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a kind of psychological torture,\\u201d Ms. Bar\\u00f3 said.\", \"For Mr. Garc\\u00eda, it leaves a question: Why had the government touted reforms if it wouldn\\u2019t tolerate voices like his?\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s like they tried perestroika without glasnost,\\u201d he said, invoking terms used in the Soviet Union during its reform era at the end of the Cold War. The first refers to official reforms, the second to the openness that was meant to follow.\", \"Mr. Garc\\u00eda made his name in the small but growing world of Cuban theater, pioneering a style in which he would write short scripts that were then used as the basis for improvisation. Many of his works centered around his own story as a dissident artist.\", \"One play, \\u201cJacuzzi,\\u201d told the stories of three Cubans \\u2014 a dissident, a Communist and an apathetic young woman \\u2014 as they discuss life and politics in a hot tub. Performances of the play, which premiered in 2017, were allowed in Cuba, though during Havana\\u2019s biggest theater festival, it was ordered to be performed in a theater that was hard to reach, he said.\", \"Hopes of greater change from thawed U.S.-Cuban relations dimmed under the Trump administration, which aggressively rolled back most of the ties that had been remade between the countries, dealing a damaging blow to the Cuban economy.\", \"By the start of 2021, the pandemic was also straining the country\\u2019s vaunted health care system.\", \"In July, hunger and blackouts ignited a wave of demonstrations, as thousands took to the streets in a show of defiance not seen in the six decades since the Cuban revolution. The government responded by arresting hundreds.\", \"Mr. Garc\\u00eda had hoped to mobilize protests again this fall. He and other activists started Archipi\\u00e9lago, a Facebook forum whose membership grew to more than 38,000. They called for a new round of protests to be held on Nov. 15, the day Cuba was set to allow foreign tourists to enter again.\", \"Mr. Garc\\u00eda found himself in the cross hairs.\", \"On Oct. 22, he said he returned home to find the pair of decapitated pigeons. Days later, hundreds of government supporters gathered at his doorstep, chanting against him.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t see a single neighbor among them,\\u201d said Mr. Garc\\u00eda, who believes the crowd was transported there by the government.\", \"By last week, state-run television began running segments saying Mr. Garc\\u00eda was aiming to violently overthrow the government. He took it as a warning that he would soon be arrested.\", \"Though he had obtained a 90-day visa from the Spanish government, Mr. Garc\\u00eda still planned to join the Nov. 15 protests. But he was blocked from leaving his home as the government stopped demonstrators from gathering.\", \"Shortly afterward, Mr. Garc\\u00eda said, two friends sneaked him out of his home to a safe house where he spent two days before arriving in Spain. The government had posted guards in front of his home, but Mr. Garc\\u00eda said he believed he was not stopped because officials wanted him out of the country.\", \"The reactions to his departure have been mixed on the Facebook group he founded. The group\\u2019s leaders, apparently unaware at first that he had fled, posted messages suggesting he had been kidnapped. Some commenters said they felt betrayed that he had left.\", \"In Spain, though, Mr. Garc\\u00eda has found welcome.\", \"On Thursday, he walked into a pizza restaurant where he was embraced by the owner, Eduardo L\\u00f3pez, who had left Cuba decades before when he was 22.\", \"\\u201cI was hoping you would come here. I had prayed for it,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Garc\\u00eda sat down and glanced at the menu. He said he wanted to return to Cuba.\", \"It wasn\\u2019t clear when that would be, if ever.\"]","href_hash":"e147b9844af111ec989a3bbc1ae2900e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e147b9844af111ec989a3bbc1ae2900e"}},
