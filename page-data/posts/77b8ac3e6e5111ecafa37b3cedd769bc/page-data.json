It was a pivotal step in the evolution of telemedicine.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-01-05T10:02:07.000Z","content":"[\"In August 1986, a doctor in Washington, D.C., manipulating a microscope, examined a tissue sample from a breast-cancer patient and correctly diagnosed that her tumor had spread. What was unusual about the diagnosis was that the tissue sample and the microscope were half a country away, in El Paso.\", \"It was a demonstration of a technology, now known as telepathology, which enables specialists to render diagnoses and other medical opinions from afar using various telecommunications technologies. At the time, the internet was in its early stages, fiber optics were not widely available and the high-definition screens now common were unknown. So for a doctor to remotely control a microscope and see a clear enough image to render a conclusion was a significant breakthrough.\", \"The demonstration had been arranged by the founder of Corabi Telemetrics, Dr. Ronald Weinstein, who at the time was also chairman of the pathology department at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke\\u2019s Medical Center in Chicago and had led the team that perfected the technology. (In fact, he is credited with coining the term \\u201ctelepathology.\\u201d) He spent the rest of his career furthering telemedicine of various kinds, first in Chicago and then, starting in 1990, at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Tucson, where he was a founder of the widely admired Arizona Telemedicine Program.\", \"Dr. Weinstein saw early on the potential for telepathology to broaden medical access.\", \"\\u201cThe limited availability of pathologists in some rural locations and areas serviced by federal medical centers is a bottleneck in the United States health care delivery system,\\u201d he wrote in the journal Human Pathology in May 1986, a few months before his groundbreaking demonstration.\", \"By the time he died last month, his early vision of telemedicine\\u2019s possibilities had become an integral part of the health care system, not only in pathology but also in numerous other specialties. The Arizona Telemedicine Program, which he directed for 25 years, had \\u201clinked more than 160 sites in 70 communities, bringing clinical services \\u2014 in some cases lifesaving \\u2014 to hundreds of thousands of patients, many of whom live in Arizona\\u2019s medically underserved areas,\\u201d Dr. Michael M.I. Abecassis, dean of the College of Medicine, said in announcing Dr. Weinstein\\u2019s death to the University of Arizona community.\", \"Dr. Weinstein\\u2019s wife, Mary (Corabi) Weinstein, said he died of heart failure on Dec. 3 at a medical center in Tucson. He was 83.\", \"Ronald S Weinstein (the S did not stand for anything and carried no period) was born on Nov. 20, 1938, in Schenectady, N.Y., to H. Edward and Shirley (Diamond) Weinstein.\", \"He studied pre-med at Union College in Schenectady, but at his father\\u2019s urging took a course in government. He got the top grade and received a Ford Foundation summer fellowship working for Representative Samuel Stratton of New York \\u2014 \\u201ca transformational education for me,\\u201d as he put it in a 2019 Founders Day lecture at the Tucson college. The skills he learned then, he said, served him well all his life, especially in his efforts to bring in government funding for medical initiatives.\", \"After earning a bachelor\\u2019s degree at Union College in 1960, he enrolled at Albany Medical College, attending from 1960 to 1963 and also working for several summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. In the 2019 lecture, he told the story of mistaking a rumpled older man for a janitor and asking him to empty the trash can, which the man did. A few minutes later, someone told him the \\u201cjanitor\\u201d was actually Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, the Nobel Prize-winning biologist. He went to apologize, and the Nobelist became a friend and mentor.\", \"He finished his medical education at Tufts University in 1965 and completed his residency at Massachusetts General Hospital, which at the time was experimenting with an early telemedicine program linking it by television camera to a clinic at Logan Airport in Boston. He was asked to look in on a few cases and, he said, \\u201cthat stuck in my mind.\\u201d\", \"In 1975 he became chairman of the pathology department at Rush-Presbyterian in Chicago, and 11 years later he was ready to introduce the idea of telepathology, founding Corabi Telemetrics, one of several companies he created or helped create to bring ideas developed in academia to market.\", \"\\u201cSears and Roebuck never intended to get into the financial business,\\u201d he said in a speech a few weeks before the 1986 demonstration of his new technology, referring to the retail giant\\u2019s expansion into banking at the time. \\u201cBut somewhere along the line, engineers figured out how to put satellites in space and revolutionized the financial industry. And what I\\u2019m going to talk about today is how the very same changes are going to revolutionize the way that we practice medicine.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Weinstein took his expertise to the University of Arizona in 1990, becoming head of the pathology department at the College of Medicine. By the mid-1990s telemedicine was well established, at least as a concept, and Bob Burns, a member of the Arizona House of Representatives who later became a state senator, had a computer programming background and took an interest in it, securing financing for a statewide initiative.\", \"When the state asked the university to oversee the project, \\u201cthey gave us the best man they had,\\u201d Mr. Burns said in a phone interview. That was Dr. Weinstein, who was named director when the program was initiated in 1996.\", \"The project, Mr. Burns said, made a particular effort to bring medical expertise to remote areas, Indian reservations and prisons \\u2014 and even abroad, to places like Panama.\", \"Elizabeth A. Krupinski, a longtime colleague and collaborator now at Emory University, said Dr. Weinstein had both vision and people skills.\", \"\\u201cHe had a knack for identifying where and how aspects of health care process and outcomes could be improved, devising a potential solution, then finding the right people to work with to make that vision a reality,\\u201d she said by email. \\u201cThat process always included bringing in people from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives to truly optimize the results, and to bring in trainees so they could be a part of the future.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Weinstein\\u2019s drive for advancing telepathology included not only widening medicine\\u2019s reach but also bringing greater humanity to it. One effort he was involved with, at the Tucson Breast Center, enabled women to have a breast biopsy, get the results and consult with a specialist on the same day, eliminating what could be a long and stressful wait.\", \"That was an issue that frequently came up during Mr. Weinstein\\u2019s time on the project. \\u201cThe majority of phone calls I get are from women who want to know where their breast biopsy report is,\\u201d he told the journal Health Executive in 2007. \\u201cThe terror in their voice is really moving.\\u201d\", \"In addition to his wife, whom he married in 1964, Dr. Weinstein is survived by a daughter, Katherine Weinstein Miller; a son, John; and two grandchildren.\"]","href_hash":"77b8ac3e6e5111ecafa37b3cedd769bc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"77b8ac3e6e5111ecafa37b3cedd769bc"}},
