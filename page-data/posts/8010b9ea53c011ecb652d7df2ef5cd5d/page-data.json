He\\u2019s often been criticized for playing them for too many minutes, rain or shine, whether or not they are performing well.\", \"So it was surprising this week, a quarter of a way through the season, when Thibodeau said that he was pulling the plug on Kemba Walker as the starting point guard in favor of Alec Burks, a reserve for most of his career and not a traditional point guard. And it wasn\\u2019t just that Walker, a four-time All-Star who signed with the Knicks in the summer, was being yanked from the lineup. Thibodeau told reporters that Walker would be out of the rotation entirely.\", \"Changing a starter this early in the season is significant, particularly when it\\u2019s one with Walker\\u2019s r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9. At 31, Walker, in theory, should still be in his athletic prime.\", \"But Thibodeau was trying to correct for an urgent, and frequent, problem: Knicks starters putting the team in a hole that the bench has to dig it out of. If playoff teams are consistently hurt by any part of their roster, it\\u2019s usually a thin bench. But for the Knicks, the starters \\u2014 even beyond Walker \\u2014 are the reason they are a fringe playoff team instead of near the top of the Eastern Conference standings.\", \"Tuesday night\\u2019s game against the Nets was illustrative. Down 1 point at halftime, the Nets came out of the break with a blistering 14-0 run against the Knicks\\u2019 starters minus guard RJ Barrett, who missed the second half with an unspecified illness. The starters climbed back into the game and briefly took the lead. But the Knicks lost the 112-110 thriller in Brooklyn \\u2014 in part because coming out of halftime flat left the team playing the Nets (15-6) from behind for most of the second half.\", \"This wasn\\u2019t an exception. In a Nov. 10 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks, the reigning champions, the Knicks went down double digits in the first quarter. Even against the Houston Rockets, one of the worst teams in the N.B.A., the Knicks fell behind 18-11 in the first quarter before tying the game by halftime and winning. The next night, Nov. 21, against Chicago, the Bulls raced out to a 20-8 start en route to victory.\", \"The starting lineup the Knicks (11-10) have played for much of the season \\u2014 Walker, Barrett, Evan Fournier, Julius Randle and Mitchell Robinson \\u2014 hasn\\u2019t just struggled. Its net rating \\u2014 a measure of how much better or worse a team or group is than their opponents \\u2014 is negative 15.7, according to the league\\u2019s tracking numbers. That places this unit among the worst starting or bench lineups in the N.B.A.\", \"The evidence was becoming undeniable. Thibodeau needed to try something else.\", \"Walker wasn\\u2019t the sole issue, but he was a big part of the problem. He\\u2019s averaging 11.7 points per game on 42.9 percent shooting from the field, and an excellent 41.3 percent from 3-point range. But Walker\\u2019s play took a nosedive in November after a hot start. In 12 games last month, Walker shot only 29.6 percent from deep. If his 3s aren\\u2019t falling, there isn\\u2019t much else he\\u2019s doing on the court.\", \"Because of chronic knee issues in recent years, Walker has lost his explosive first step, so he\\u2019s not able to get to the rim as effectively. And because of his height \\u2014 Walker is listed at 6 feet tall \\u2014 and slower foot speed, Walker was targeted on defense. The only way to justify keeping him on the court would be if he spread the floor with his shooting, and he is no longer doing that.\", \"Inserting Burks into the starting lineup for Walker makes some things easier for the Knicks. He\\u2019s bigger \\u2014 listed at 6-foot-6 \\u2014 which makes him a more versatile defender. On Tuesday night, he was just as likely to guard the 6-foot-5 James Harden as the quick rookie guard Cameron Thomas, who is 6-foot-3. Early in the third quarter, Burks blocked a Patty Mills 3-pointer \\u2014 easier for him than for Walker.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re able to switch 1 through 4,\\u201d Derrick Rose, the Knicks reserve guard, said of Burks\\u2019s insertion into the lineup. \\u201cYou\\u2019re more versatile. I mean, A.B. is a hell of a player. A playmaker. A great shooter.\\u201d\", \"But Burks doesn\\u2019t fully solve a starting lineup problem that led Thibodeau to increasingly rely on the bench late in games. The Knicks don\\u2019t have much of a fast-break offense and often depend on isolations to get their points \\u2014 which would be fine if their shooters did more work on their own to get open rather than just standing still. The team is near the top of the league in contested shots and toward the bottom in wide-open ones.\", \"Fournier\\u2019s stats dipped in November like Walker\\u2019s did, causing Thibodeau to barely use him in key moments late in games. Thibodeau did call his number on Tuesday night against the Nets, and Fournier rewarded him by hitting a game-tying 3-pointer with 18 seconds left. But overall, Fournier shot 5 for 12 for 13 points in 22 minutes, with no rebounds or assists. Like with Walker, if Fournier isn\\u2019t consistently a 3-point threat, there\\u2019s little reason for him to be on the floor.\", \"Randle, the team\\u2019s best player, has faced an onslaught of double teams without reliable shooting around him, and he has struggled. Randle is shooting only 41.7 percent from the field and 32.5 percent from 3 \\u2014 all below his career averages. All of Barrett\\u2019s numbers have declined from last year as well. Barrett has improved his finishing around the rim, but his shooting has always been his biggest question mark, one he appeared to answer last year when he shot 40.1 percent from deep. Now he\\u2019s at 32.1 percent. (For his part, Barrett also started slowly last year, only to pick it up in the second half of the season.)\", \"Thibodeau was not in the mood to discuss the lineup change after Tuesday\\u2019s loss. Asked about it, Thibodeau expressed anger at the game\\u2019s officiating and then left the news conference after just one question.\", \"The saving grace for the Knicks has been their bench trio of Rose, Obi Toppin and Immanuel Quickley. The team is third in the N.B.A. in bench scoring. Toppin is a sorely needed threat at the rim and in transition and does something the Knicks generally don\\u2019t do well: cut. Quickley and Rose have provided quality shooting, especially late in games, and Rose has been one of the few Knicks effective at getting to the rim.\", \"Swapping Walker for Burks swap has already paid dividends. He scored 25 and 23 points in the last two games, his only two starts of the season. And the Knicks may need to make more adjustments. More lineup changes mean the increased potential for hurt feelings among veteran players, but as Thibodeau said before the game on Tuesday: \\u201cYou have to put winning first.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8010b9ea53c011ecb652d7df2ef5cd5d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8010b9ea53c011ecb652d7df2ef5cd5d"}},
