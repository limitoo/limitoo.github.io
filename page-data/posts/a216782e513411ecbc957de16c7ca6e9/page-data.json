While most of this lava has spread across previously affected land, some has touched areas that were previously unaffected by the eruption.\", \"Local authorities have closed off the northern access to the volcano's exclusion zone due to the increasingly adverse conditions.\", \"In the various videos posted by Involcan, you can see a new vent opening up on the volcano, a lava fountain and a lava flow transporting a big boulder, among other facets of the eruption.\", \"In total, more than 7,000 people have had to flee their homes on the island\\u2014which has a population of around 85,000\\u2014as a result of the ongoing eruptions, local government figures show.\", \"Lava flows have now covered more than 1,100 hectares of land on La Palma, destroying hundreds of buildings and swathes of farmland in the process.\", \"On Sunday, Pevolca issued a warning about \\\"very unfavorable,\\\" air quality in some municipalities on the island, urging residents to avoid outdoor activities where possible.\", \"The warning was issued following a rise in emissions of sulfur dioxide, which volcanologists use as a metric for how long eruptions are potentially going to last. Sulfur dioxide emissions have increased by several thousands of tons per day in recent days.\", \"Pedro Hern\\u00e1ndez, an expert with Involcan, told El Pa\\u00eds, \\\"we may begin to see a light at the end of the tunnel when we get several days at hundreds of tons, instead of thousands.\\\"\", \"Two other metrics that can provide an indication of how long an eruption is going to last\\u2014earthquake activity and vibrations caused by the flow of gas and magma\\u2014are also showing increased values.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1941534/cumbre-vieja-volcano-la-palma.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Cumbre Vieja volcano continues to erupt on November 11, 2021 in La Palma, Spain.</div>\"]","href_hash":"a216782e513411ecbc957de16c7ca6e9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a216782e513411ecbc957de16c7ca6e9"}},
