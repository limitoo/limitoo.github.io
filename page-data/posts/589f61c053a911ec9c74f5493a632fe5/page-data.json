Washington shoots over Memphis Grizzlies center Steven Adams at Spectrum Center, North Carolina. \\nPhoto: Photosport\\n</div>\", \"LeBron James being asymptomatic with Covid really sums up the Los Angeles Lakers season.\", \"Right now it's the Phoenix Suns and Golden State Warriors making all the noise out West. Their first game looked like the conference finals preview. The Suns win meant they went undefeated for November, the first time in the league since the record breaking 73-9 Warriors team of 2015.\", \"In the East, New York tumbled down to 7th, while the 4th placed Washington Wizards remain the feel good team of the season, and the upstart Cleveland Cavaliers are keeping many of last years playoff teams outside the top 8.\", \"Here's your November NBA Report:\", \"MVP\", \"Steph Curry and Nikola Jokic continue to play like MVPs, though Jokic will need to get Denver firing to stay in the conversation.\", \"Kevin Durant is dealing with the still unvaccinated Kyrie Irving, the unexpectedly streaky James Harden, and a slew of injuries to team mates, but still has the Brooklyn Nets first in the East, all while leading the league in scoring.\", \"Giannis Antetokounmpo is 3rd in scoring, 6th in rebounds, and 9th in blocks (the only player in the top 10 for all 3 categories). Last year's Finals MVP closed out November by leading the Bucks on a seven-game win streak.\", \"Defensive Player of the Year\", \"Rudy Gobert has kept the Utah Jazz steady behind Phoenix and Golden State. His importance as a defensive anchor really shines when compared to other players putting up great numbers - Anthony Davis (Los Angeles Lakers), Myles Turner (Indiana Pacers), Mo Bamba (Orlando Magic), Clint Capela (Atlanta Hawks) - who have had their hard defence undercut by poor team performances.\", \"Jaren Jackson Jr had to step up in Ja Morant's (could have been much worse knee sprain) absence, and answered the call with blistering play to keep Memphis a top 5 team in the West.\", \"Mikal Bridges might just have the best defensive feet in the league. His guarding of Steph Curry, in their first matchup of the year, was a masterclass. He's been as vital to Phoenix's record run as Chris Paul or Devin Booker.\", \"6th man\", \"Tyler Herro remains the leagues hottest bench shooter, though he's clocked a couple of starts.\", \"Montrezl Harrell has found his swagger in Washington. The energetic, undersized, centre is averaging 16 points on 65% shooting, plus career highs in rebounds and assists.\", \"It's hard to pick the top rookie between No.3 Evan Mobley, and No.4 Scottie Barnes. Mobley's the better defender, while Barnes has court vision and outside shooting. They've both caught teams off guard and it will be interesting to see how they go against better prepared opponents.\", \"No.1 pick Cade Cunningham recovered from his own injury, and slow start, to finish the month strong. He'll be chasing that top spot during December.\", \"No.7 pick Josh Giddey became OKC's starting point guard, and the third teenager to record 100 rebounds and 100 assists in his first 20 games. The others? LeBron and last year's winner, LaMelo Ball.\", \"Current Season Averages:\", \"6.4 points / 49.5% FG / 68.8% FT / 8.0 rebounds (3.5O/4.5D) / 2.8 assists / 0.9 steals / 0.8 blocks\", \"There were games in November where \\\"Aquaman\\\" didn't look engaged. Coach Taylor Jenkins closes games with a smaller lineup, and Jackson Jr at centre, meaning Adams minutes are sporadic (19 minutes one night, 31 the next) and the lowest since his rookie year. His shooting, apart from free throws, is problematic, putting up less than 9 attempts a game at an abysmal 49.5% (his career average is 58.8%). The screens are still bone-jarring, the assists now include highlight plays, and the defence is actually trending up, but something is off in Memphis.\"]","href_hash":"589f61c053a911ec9c74f5493a632fe5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"589f61c053a911ec9c74f5493a632fe5"}},
