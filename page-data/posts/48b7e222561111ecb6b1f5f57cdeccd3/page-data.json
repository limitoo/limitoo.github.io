A past infection may also offer little defense against Omicron. Here\\u2019s what we know so far.\", \"Omicron may have been spreading in New York City well before the W.H.O. even gave it a name, thanks to a 53,000-person anime convention. And Botswana\\u2019s leaders said foreign diplomats, who had traveled from Europe, were some of the first known cases.\", \"Research: The Times went inside a cutting edge lab in South Africa, the first country to identify the variant. The country\\u2019s high rate of H.I.V. infection may give the virus more chances to mutate.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"An estimated 22.8 million people \\u2014 more than half of Afghanistan\\u2019s population \\u2014 are expected to face potentially life-threatening food insecurity this winter. Of those, 8.7 million are already nearing famine.\", \"The hunger is the most devastating sign of the economic crash that has crippled Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power nearly four months ago. Food prices are soaring as families flood into the malnutrition wards of hospitals.\", \"The mass starvation could kill a million children this winter. That alone would dwarf the total number of civilians estimated to have been killed as a direct result of war.\", \"Background: Afghanistan has suffered from malnutrition for decades, but the country\\u2019s hunger crisis has drastically worsened without foreign aid money. The U.S. is now facing mounting pressure to ease the economic restrictions on the Taliban that have isolated the country, crippled banks and deepened the crisis.\", \"Environment: Afghanistan is confronting one of the worst droughts in decades. The country\\u2019s wheat harvest is expected to be as much as 25 percent below average this year.\", \"Taliban: Leaders are rewarding their fighters with property, even if that means evicting other citizens. The group also issued a decree that bans forced marriages and calls for more rights for women, but it does not say whether they will regain easier access to education or jobs.\", \"Powerful associates of President Bashar al-Assad are making and selling captagon, an illegal, addictive amphetamine popular in Saudi Arabia and other Arab states. Syria has now become the world\\u2019s newest narcostate.\", \"The industry, which emerged in the ruins of a decade of war, has grown into a multibillion-dollar operation. Captagon is now the country\\u2019s most valuable export, far surpassing legal products.\", \"An investigation by The Times found that much of the production and distribution was overseen by an elite unit of the Syrian army commanded by the president\\u2019s younger brother. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah is also a major player.\", \"Scale: More than 250 million captagon pills have been seized across the globe so far this year, more than 18 times the amount captured just four years ago.\", \"Thousands of U.S. and Japanese soldiers died in the Battle of Biak, a fierce World War II fight. Collectors are still finding remnants on the remote Indonesian island, which could bring solace to the families of U.S. soldiers whose remains are still missing.\", \"Once, broadcasting the decision to quit a job might have seemed unwise, or at least uncouth. But now, many people are celebrating their departures on social media.\", \"They are rejoicing in Instagram reels and posting giddy \\u201cQuitToks.\\u201d They\\u2019re tweeting screenshots of their \\u201cI quit\\u201d texts to their bosses, or virtually high-fiving on the Reddit forum R/antiwork.\", \"The percentage of U.S. workers voluntarily leaving their jobs reached 3 percent this fall, a historic high. And employers are growing less choosy about who they hire. That may offer some cushion to those punching back at their former bosses.\", \"\\u201cPeople are frustrated, exhausted, triggered,\\u201d J.T. O\\u2019Donnell, founder of the career coaching platform Work It Daily, said. \\u201cWhen people are triggered, you see fight or flight responses. This is a fight response.\\u201d\", \"This raspberry-mochi butter cake with matcha glaze is an unexpectedly easy stir-and-bake dessert.\", \"My colleagues recommend these eight self-help books, which have tips on building healthy spaces and parenting in a changing world, and inspiring poems.\", \"\\u201cFlee,\\u201d a Danish documentary, uses animation to tell the poignant, complicated story of an Afghan refugee.\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword.\", \"And here is today\\u2019s Spelling Bee.\", \"You can find all our puzzles here.\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing.
