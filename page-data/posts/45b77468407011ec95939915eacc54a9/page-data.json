record an interaction at an Adelaide restaurant with a former MP and her husband who have since been accused of blackmail, according to court documents.\", \"The documents\\u00a0further allege Mr Malinauskas took the step\\u00a0\\\"with a view to shutting down a parliamentary inquiry\\\" into bullying and intimidation within the party.\", \"Annabel and Greg Digance have been charged with blackmailing Mr Malinauskas between February and March last year, but Ms Digance is seeking to have the case against them thrown out.\", \"In documents filed to the Adelaide Magistrates Court, Ms Digance called for the prosecution case against her to be withdrawn, arguing that the conversations she and her husband had with Mr Malinauskas around seeking political advantage did not constitute blackmail offences.\", \"\\\"Section 171 [of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act]\\u00a0makes it clear that the meaning of blackmail is limited and does not include non-violent threats made in the course of negotiations to secure a political advantage,\\\"\\u00a0Ms Digance's\\u00a0lawyer\\u00a0Angela Pierce wrote.\", \"Dr Pierce claimed the prosecution case was \\\"totally unfounded\\\" and relied on two secret recordings of private discussions \\u2013 including one in which\\u00a0Mr Malinauskas was wired by SA Police.\", \"The documents claimed Mr Malinauskas and SA Police had those \\\"secret recordings\\\" in their possession for more than a year but that Mr Malinauskas had told police he did not want to prosecute and intended to withdraw his complaint after the next state election, scheduled for March.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e998b13523f06e4b6075bb96e32767fa\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Annabel and Greg Digance outside court earlier this month.(ABC News: Claire Campbell)</div>\", \"But\\u00a0the documents state that\\u00a0less than two weeks after SA Parliament called for claims of bullying within SA Labor to be investigated by a parliamentary\\u00a0inquiry\\u00a0\\u2014 at which\\u00a0Ms Digance said she planned to \\\"exercise her right to free speech and to tell the truth as she knew it\\\" \\u2014\\u00a0Mr Malinauskas instructed the police to instigate the prosecution.\", \"That select committee has been delayed indefinitely until the blackmail charges have been dealt with in the court.\", \"\\\"Had the select committee proceeded, Ms Digance could have given evidence on such matters under protection of parliamentary privilege,\\\" Dr Pierce wrote.\", \"\\\"The prosecution should be dismissed on the basis that there is no case to answer and in any event constitutes an obvious abuse of the process of the court for the purpose of Mr Malinauskas stymieing the parliamentary select committee.\", \"\\\"Mrs Digance has every right to tell the world what she knows.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Prosecution driven by 'malice', document claims</div>\", \"In the documents, Dr Pierce said if the prosecution was to proceed, Ms Digance sought to cross-examine Mr Malinauskas and Mr Martin to prove her case, including to elicit evidence that the prosecution was instigated by Mr Malinauskas for \\\"an ulterior political purpose and out of malice towards Mrs Digance\\\".\", \"Ms\\u00a0Digance also sought to cross-examine Detective Sergeant Justin Ganley \\u2013 who,\\u00a0she claimed, helped Mr Malinauskas present himself as a victim and her \\\"as guilty\\\".\", \"Ms Digance maintains that the police conduct against her and her husband was an abuse of process.\", \"Her lawyer alleges that, on the day Ms Digance and her husband were arrested,\\u00a0more than 13 police officers in six police cars arrived at the Digances' Strathalbyn property at dawn.\", \"They were refused police bail and accompanied by Major Crime detectives to the City Watchhouse ahead of their first court appearance.\", \"The court documents state police did not have a special warrant, but conducted an extensive search of their property and took away many items of the Digances' personal property, acting on a general search warrant.\", \"Ms Digance said the police officer she was travelling with told her to duck as she approached a large media contingent.\", \"\\\"Detective Ganley purported to give Mr Malinauskas advice as to how he should deal with the media and had thus strayed from the purported role that is generally accepted of senior detectives entrusted in the investigation of a major crime.\", \"\\\"It appears from Detective Sergeant Ganley's notes that he took on the role of media consultant in giving Mr Malinauskas advice as to how he should present himself to the media as a victim.\\\"\", \"In the documents, Dr Pierce said the conduct of the police was an \\\"inflammatory\\\" and \\\"wholly inappropriate attempt to politicise a matter that did not require the resources of the Major Crime echelons\\\".\", \"\\\"The conduct of the police in portraying Mrs Digance as guilty and concomitantly Mr Malinauskas as 'the victim' strikes at the heart of the criminal process,\\\" Dr Pierce wrote.\", \"The prosecution sought to block the release of the court documents\\u00a0to the media.\", \"A timeline contained within the court documents alleges the matter unfolded as follows:\", \"The matter will return\\u00a0to court next week.\"]","href_hash":"45b77468407011ec95939915eacc54a9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"45b77468407011ec95939915eacc54a9"}},
