It was not easy to find one anywhere, he said.\", \"\\\"If they compensate us fairly, I have no way to use this money to buy a similar house within three months, within one year or even two years. There's no guarantee I can find a similar place in the whole country.\\\"\", \"Fox said he was bracing to see the impact.\", \"\\\"I don't want to know it's there. I don't want to have to hear it, see it, smell it, feel it.
