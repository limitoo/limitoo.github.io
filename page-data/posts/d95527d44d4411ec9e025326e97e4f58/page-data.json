Still, the trophy went to Vince Gill.\", \"This time around, Guyton is back, and she has increased her odds.\", \"When the nominations for the 64th annual Grammys, to be held on Jan. 31 in Los Angeles, were announced on Tuesday, the Texas-born singer and songwriter was recognized in three categories \\u2014 best country album, best country song and best country solo performance \\u2014 for her debut full-length, \\u201cRemember Her Name,\\u201d and its title track. That puts an album with largely unprecedented tracks like \\u201cDifferent\\u201d and \\u201cLove My Hair\\u201d alongside some of the genre\\u2019s heaviest hitters, including Miranda Lambert and Chris Stapleton.\", \"Fresh off a flight on Tuesday evening, Guyton, who has also made a name for herself as an outspoken activist in notoriously insular Nashville, discussed by phone how her second batch of nominations differed from her first and what exactly makes something country. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"Congratulations.\", \"[Screams] Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!\", \"How are you feeling?\", \"Of course I found out on a plane. I\\u2019ve been dealing with a sick child, so I haven\\u2019t been able to process anything. I didn\\u2019t even know the nominations were coming out until this morning. I was on the plane and I was texting my husband, like, \\u201cHear anything?\\u201d \\u201cNope.\\u201d Then all of a sudden I got all these text messages.\", \"I just feel very \\u2014 what\\u2019s the word? Grateful. Relieved? Because I followed my instincts. This whole album came from me and what I thought I should release, and that\\u2019s something I\\u2019ve never done. I\\u2019ve always leaned on everybody else to make these decisions for me. This time, it was my decisions. It goes to show: I was right.\", \"That must feel validating.\", \"That\\u2019s the word \\u2014 I feel validated. Like, ugh, thank God. Because there was doubt cast upon this project before I released it. So now to see the response, I just feel relieved.\", \"Last Grammys you became the first Black woman nominated for best solo country performance and played \\u201cBlack Like Me\\u201d on the show. This time, you\\u2019re back in the same category, plus two other nominations in the country field. Does it feel different the second time around?\", \"It does. All my songs are pretty socially conscious, and this one was that, too, but it was actually my own story. The other song [\\u201cBlack Like Me\\u201d] was my story, but it was so many other people\\u2019s story. This time it\\u2019s all on me. It\\u2019s so personal. \\u201cRemember Her Name\\u201d \\u2014 people tried to talk me out of even titling my album that. Normally I would have acquiesced. But I said no, it\\u2019s called \\u201cRemember Her Name\\u201d for a reason.\", \"You\\u2019ve also put yourself at the forefront of this growing movement in Nashville regarding equality and respect for Black artists, female artists and Black female artists. Do you think there\\u2019s been progress?\", \"I do. I really, truly do. I get messages from not only Black women but women, period, feeling encouraged \\u2014 and men! Feeling encouraged to just be 100 percent who they are. For so long there\\u2019s just been this formula, this box that we\\u2019re all supposed to fit in. And the reality is that the box never existed. You don\\u2019t have to bend the knee to the system in order to succeed.\", \"How do you balance the idea of personal progress \\u2014 the successes you\\u2019ve found \\u2014 and broader, institutional progress? Is it ever tough to try to disentangle the two?\", \"Sometimes it is and I suffer because I\\u2019ve got two different feet in both areas. But from looking at the way things have been done in the past, I\\u2019ve realized that it\\u2019s not enough for one country artist, one person of color, to make it every now and again \\u2014 every 25 years, every 5 years, every 10 years. That\\u2019s not going to sustain itself. There\\u2019s power in numbers.\", \"In addition to the Grammys, you\\u2019ve performed at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, co-hosted and been nominated at the ACMs, been nominated at the CMAs, you\\u2019re performing at the Thanksgiving parade and the Rockefeller Christmas tree lighting ceremony. Sometimes it feels like you\\u2019re everywhere except country radio. Why haven\\u2019t they caught up?\", \"You know, you should ask them. You should go ahead and call them. It\\u2019s truly unfortunate, but I can\\u2019t spend my nights fretting over that. That\\u2019s their decision. I\\u2019m just going to keep pressing forward. There are other avenues for people to listen to me, and they\\u2019re finding me \\u2014 and thank God for that.\", \"Is that something you, your team and your label are still pushing for \\u2014 a breakthrough there?\", \"No. It would be beautiful. I would absolutely accept if they did choose to want to support me. But I\\u2019m not going to lose sleep over it. Absolutely not.\", \"There was some slight controversy regarding the country album category this year when it was decided by the Recording Academy\\u2019s genre screening committees that Kacey Musgraves\\u2019s new album, \\u201cStar-Crossed,\\u201d did not qualify and belonged in pop. As someone whose validity in the genre has been questioned, do you have feelings about what makes an album country enough?\", \"I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s our job to define what is and what isn\\u2019t in a genre. If the artist is telling you that it is, I feel like that\\u2019s enough and we should accept it. Music is relative and art is art. Country music has expanded so much. The lines are blurred. Hopefully in the future we\\u2019re not made to have to make those decisions. If an artist is telling you, \\u201cI\\u2019m country,\\u201d you should take that at face value.\", \"Morgan Wallen was totally shut out of Grammy nominations, even with one of the best-selling releases of the year and after an album of the year nod from the CMAs. You were one of the first people to take a stand after he was seen using a racial slur, asking, \\u201cWhat exactly are y\\u2019all going to do about it. Crickets won\\u2019t work this time.\\u201d Do you think this sends a message, or has the industry\\u2019s response been too mixed?\", \"The industry has been very mixed, to me. But that\\u2019s all on them. I hope that Morgan is on the path to healing and doing the work. I don\\u2019t find satisfaction in any artist suffering. I hope people feel the weight of their actions, but I don\\u2019t ever want to see anybody fail.\", \"Do you have favorite albums among the nominees, outside of country music? Who are you excited to see at the show, either onstage or backstage?\", \"I really enjoyed Olivia Rodrigo\\u2019s album. I was in the air when all the nominees came in, so I don\\u2019t even know everybody yet. But I\\u2019m just assuming Olivia Rodrigo.\"]","href_hash":"d95527d44d4411ec9e025326e97e4f58"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d95527d44d4411ec9e025326e97e4f58"}},
