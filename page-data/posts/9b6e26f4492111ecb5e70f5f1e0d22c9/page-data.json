My father, who harbored literary aspirations of his own, made the rounds, accepting congratulations, until he could bear it no longer. \\u201cShe stole my writing style!\\u201d he declared to a friend.\", \"In \\u201cThese Precious Days,\\u201d Ann Patchett\\u2019s excellent collection of essays, she recalls her own father, an L.A. cop who scorned her writing ambitions and encouraged her to be a dental hygienist. Because, just like him, she would surely end up divorced with children to support. \\u201cHaving someone who believed in my failure more than my success kept me alert,\\u201d Patchett writes. \\u201cIt made me fierce. Without ever meaning to, my father taught me at a very early age to give up on the idea of approval.\\u201d\", \"Her story had a twist, though. Patchett\\u2019s mother, a nurse, fell in love with a surgeon who moved to Nashville. She followed him there, her two young daughters in tow, and married him. Stepfather Mike \\u201c broke plates and put his fist through hollow doors and thought I was the second coming of Christ,\\u201d she writes. \\u201cHe spent five mornings a week in analysis for more years than should be legal. All he wanted was to be a writer.\\u201d\", \"When her mother married for the third time, Patchett was 27: \\u201cShe didn\\u2019t see either of her first two husbands anymore, but both men were central in my life: my father wanting me to be more like him, my stepfather wanting to be more like me.\\u201d\", \"Any aspiring writer would. Now 58, Patchett graduated from Sarah Lawrence College, earned her M.F.A. at the Iowa Writers\\u2019 Workshop, has written eight novels (her most recent, \\u201cThe Dutch House,\\u201d was a Pulitzer finalist), four works of nonfiction and two children\\u2019s books. In 2011, she opened Parnassus Books in Nashville, turning it into a writers\\u2019 haven and cultural oasis. In 2017, she was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\", \"Although she did indeed divorce her first husband, she never had children to support. She married her second husband, Karl, after 11 years of dating; he is 16 years her senior and a medical doctor who earned a master\\u2019s in philosophy and theology at Oxford.\", \"In the essay \\u201cThere Are No Children Here,\\u201d Patchett recounts being interviewed on a national radio show. \\u201c\\u2018Your husband is considerably older than you are,\\u2019 the host says. \\u2018Chances are you\\u2019ll be alone at the end of your life. Don\\u2019t you worry about that?\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018I don\\u2019t mind talking about this,\\u2019 I said. \\u2018But I wonder, would you ask Jonathan Franzen the same questions? He doesn\\u2019t have children.\\u2019 When the interview aired, all the questions about my childlessness had been edited out.\\u201d\", \"To Patchett\\u2019s credit, she goes on to address the question, both for herself and the reader: \\u201cTo have a child required the willful forgetting of what childhood was actually like; it required you to turn away from the very real chance that you do to the person you loved most in the world the exact same thing that was done to you. No. No, thank you.\\u201d\", \"That said, Patchett has plenty of love to spread around, including for her father. After he is diagnosed with Parkinson\\u2019s, she and her sister commute to L.A. for the duration of his illness. The relief she feels when he dies is hard-earned, even as friends look askance at her lack of grieving. She puts it this way: \\u201cWhat if you\\u2019ve thrown a dinner party. And at 11:00 your guests finally get up to leave. The dishes are still on the table, the pans are in the sink, you have to go to work in the morning, but the guests just keep standing in the open door saying good night. They tell you another story, praise your cooking, go back to look for their gloves. They do this for three years.\\u201d\", \"Other essays are cast in a more lighthearted vein. Patchett has a talent for friendship and celebrates many of those friends here. She writes with pure love for her mother, and with humor and some good-natured exasperation at Karl, who is such a great character he warrants a book of his own. Patchett\\u2019s account of his feigned offer to buy a woman\\u2019s newly adopted baby when she expresses unwarranted doubts is priceless.\", \"She also addresses how owning a bookstore has enriched her life: \\u201cI once believed that nothing could surpass winning a big literary award, but I was mistaken. The thing that\\u2019s been so much better has been to create jobs in my community. \\u2026 Even the introverted readers, the silent writers, want a place where they feel welcomed and understood. \\u2026 That\\u2019s how I discovered that my truest destiny was a thing I never saw coming.\\u201d\", \"In the title essay, \\u201cThese Precious Days,\\u201d Patchett charts her acquaintance with Tom Hanks and what becomes an intimate friendship with his assistant, Sooki. Diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, Sooki moves to Nashville, where, with Karl\\u2019s help, she receives treatment just as the coronavirus pandemic hits. What begins as a routine story of illness becomes an exploration of families and a central character who refuses to be characterized.\", \"The days that Patchett refers to are precious indeed, but her writing is anything but. She describes deftly, with a line or a look, and I considered the absence of paragraphs freighted with adjectives to be a mercy. I don\\u2019t care about the hue of the sky or the shade of the couch. That\\u2019s not writing; it\\u2019s decorating. Or hiding. Patchett\\u2019s heart, smarts and 40 years of craft create an economy that delivers her perfectly understated stories emotionally whole. Her writing style is most gloriously her own.\"]","href_hash":"9b6e26f4492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9b6e26f4492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}},
