He was very quiet, very different to what he had been prior to deploying,'' he said.\", \"Mr Jenkins said that, during Christmas in 2015, Shaun told him he was suffering from PTSD and couldn't sleep.\", \"He said his son had never told anyone about his problems when he first left Afghanistan, for fear it would affect his suitability for further deployments.\", \"When his son died, Mr Jenkins said they asked DVA for access to Shaun's medical records, which was \\\"a horrendous experience\\\" for his mother, Sue.\", \"He outlined how DVA appeared to immediately suspect Sue was seeking money or compensation.\", \"\\\"Sue contacted DVA \\u2026\\u00a0the first thing they said to her was that she wasn't entitled to any money or compensation because she wasn't his partner or child,'' Mr Jenkins said.\", \"\\\"As I said, we still never received that. It came across like DVA was nothing more than a large insurance company that was looking at protecting its assets rather than providing any type of assistance or support.\\\"\", \"Mr Jenkins said a coroner's report noted that Shaun had been diagnosed with PTSD, was seeking treatment and had identified that he was suicidal.\", \"He said Shaun was \\\"just sent back to work\\\", despite having suicidal thoughts.\", \"Mr Jenkins revealed that they had never been able to recover their son's telephone from the Queensland Coroner's office.\", \"He said his son's phone, if it was probably not destroyed, would be sitting in a property office in the Townsville police station.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Department says it take\\u00a0matters raised at royal commission 'seriously'</div>\", \"DVA today issued statement in relation to the royal commission saying it was not appropriate for the department to comment on matters raised during the hearings as the inquiry was ongoing.\", \"A spokesperson said the loss of any current or former serving member was a tragedy and deeply felt by the entire Defence and veteran community.\", \"\\\"The department welcomes the royal commission as an opportunity to reduce the instances of death by suicide in the Defence and veteran communities,'' said the spokesperson.\", \"\\\"The department understands this is a difficult time for many, sharing their stories, and takes the matters being raised during the course of the royal commission seriously.\\\"\", \"The Queensland Police Service has been contacted for comment.\"]","href_hash":"4022f895531f11ec9238950585eca692"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4022f895531f11ec9238950585eca692"}},
