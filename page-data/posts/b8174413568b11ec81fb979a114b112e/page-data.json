Had I not fired Comey, you might not be talking to me right now about a beautiful book of four years at the White House,\\\" Trump told Mark Levin.\", \"\\\"And we'll see about the future. The future is going to be very interesting,\\\" Trump said. \\\"But I fired Comey, that whole group. And now that group is coming back again. I mean, it's not believable. It shouldn't be allowed to happen.\\\"\", \"Later on in the interview, Trump added: \\\"If I didn't fire Comey, they were looking to take down the President of the United States.\", \"\\\"Some people said, 'you made a mistake when you fired Comey' and now those same people say it was one of the most incredible, instinctual moves that they've ever seen.\", \"\\\"I don't think I could've survived if I didn't fire him,\\\" Trump added.\", \"At the time, Trump said Comey was fired so the FBI can be led by someone to restore \\\"public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.\\\"\", \"In February 2017, Trump reportedly asked Comey to back away from investigating his national security adviser Michael Flynn over his alleged ties to Russia.
