best hope\\u00a0was\\u00a0a stem cell transplant.\\u00a0\", \"For that to happen\\u00a0she needed to find a match from within her own family or from a registry of donors.\", \"Also referred to as a bone marrow transplant, the procedure\\u00a0itself is\\u00a0much like a blood transfusion.\", \"In preparation, Ms Garvie's own immune system needed to be shut down.\", \"After\\u00a0months of living in cancer accommodation in Adelaide,\\u00a0away from her home and two teenage children in Loxton\\u00a0in the Riverland of South Australia,\\u00a0Ms Garvie likened the process\\u00a0to facing a steep hill at the end of a marathon.\", \"\\\"Cancer takes everything you have and I felt like I had just done so much hard work, I had been in this really good mindset and hoping that chemo would do the job,\\\" she said.\", \"But a donor was found and the stem cell transplant was a success.\", \"Ms Garvie's own stem cells were replaced with those of her donor to rebuild her blood and immune systems.\", \"\\\"It's the most harrowing thing I've ever been through, but it saved my life,\\\" Ms Garvie said.\", \"\\\"I'm back home now, I'm able to be with my loved ones, to be present in their lives.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b1f03e202811821ae59bb3e61ec410af\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Shelley with her children, Jett

donor are infused into a patient's bloodstream.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ebd1f3c43c2c688921112f636f1bf326\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

cure for blood and bone marrow cancers and other diseases.\", \"About 30 per cent of all patients\\u00a0can find a donor within their family, with siblings usually offering the best chance of a match.\", \"But Ms Garvie's\\u00a0sister Jodie was not a match and her only\\u00a0hope was to be matched with an unrelated donor.\", \"That process was conducted by the Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry (ABMDR)\\u00a0by searching the Australian and overseas\\u00a0donor registries.\", \"Like 80 per cent of the 400 Australian patients needing a bone marrow transplant each year, Ms Garvie's donor was found overseas.\", \"The ABMDR has been calling on the government to change the way Australia recruits and tests donors to\\u00a0improve the domestic donor pool and avoid the delays, supply issues and the financial impacts of importing stem cells,\\u00a0especially during a pandemic.\", \"Chief executive Lisa Smith said while Australia would always need to use overseas donors, an 80 per cent dependency was well in excess of global norms.\", \"The\\u00a0federal government funded a\\u00a0review of the HPC sector in 2018\\u00a0and released a\\u00a0National HPC Framework\\u00a0in November 2021, which identified reducing reliance on overseas donors and improved recruitment model as long-term objectives.\", \"But without a concrete time frame progress had\\u00a0stalled, Ms Smith said.\", \"\\\"The framework says nothing about life after June 30 next year and leaves all the old questions unanswered,\\\" she said.\", \"<img

give blood through the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood program.\", \"There are about 180,000 people registered and the procedure for donating stem cells is similar to donating plasma.\", \"But Ms Smith said some of the restrictions on blood\\u00a0did not apply to stem cell donation and called for Australia to adopt the international model of allowing donors to register online and conduct a home cheek swab for tissue testing.\", \"This model has been piloted in Australia twice through the ABMDR's Strength to Give campaign, launched in 2018.\", \"Those campaigns recruited\\u00a0about 12,000\\u00a0donors, but\\u00a0the program has now closed and needs government approval\\u00a0to continue.\", \"\\\"That would put us in a position where we start to see more Australian patients receiving donations from Australian donors and we don't have to deal with the risk, the complexity and the time delay involved with importing products from overseas, particularly during a pandemic,\\\" Ms Smith\\u00a0said.\", \"\\\"Government needs to make the decision to let us spend the money on the recruitment of donors in this way.\", \"\\\"We need to repair Australia's donor pool

timely manner here,\\\" the foundation's Blood Cancer Partnerships general manager Tim Murphy said.\", \"\\\"People aren't necessarily missing out on the transplant itself, but what is happening is it takes a bit longer to happen and with the challenges around COVID \\u2026 the supply of stem cells became very acute.\", \"\\\"If we had more secure supply within Australia some of those challenges wouldn't be so challenging.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/9fc443e93ca79ae4988e49951fa20dd9\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Stem
