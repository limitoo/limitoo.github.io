But, uptake of the self-collection kits has not been as strong as many had hoped.\", \"According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, between 2002 and 2012, the majority of women diagnosed with cervical cancer had either never been screened for the disease or were lapsed screeners.\", \"That's disappointing to Professor Frazer.\", \"\\\"The challenge is to get women to take part in the screening program and if we can make it easier for them and less painful or even just emotionally less difficult, then yes, obviously that will help with the screening program work really well,\\\" he said.\", \"The tests screen for human papillomavirus (HPV), which is the cause of about 90 per cent of all cervical cancers. Routine screening is available through Medicare every five years for anyone with a cervix aged between 25 and 74 years.\", \"The government will also use the money to support Australia's largest clinical trial, known as Compass, which examines the interactions between the HPV vaccine and HPV screening.\", \"The trial has over 76,000 participants and information from it will then be used to improve the National Cervical Screening Program.\"]","href_hash":"c7bb6eb3472b11ecb075f778d74318da"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c7bb6eb3472b11ecb075f778d74318da"}},
