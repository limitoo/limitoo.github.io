We made two big discoveries on Thursday. The first was creamed dried sweet corn. The second was the Omicron variant of Covid, which was first identified by scientists in South Africa. I guess you could say the corn went down better than the cron.\", \"If we end up having another big surge in cases, hospitalizations and deaths, should we go back to lockdowns? Or do things differently?\", \"Gail Collins: We had a great time, Bret. Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays. We had the same old gang that comes every year. Well, every nonpandemic year. One of them wrote to me the next morning saying how nice it was that life felt \\u201cback to normal.\\u201d\", \"That was exactly the way I felt, but you\\u2019re right \\u2014 all of a sudden we\\u2019re hit with a new virus variant. My immediate plan is to follow all safety protocols but otherwise pretend it isn\\u2019t happening.\", \"I\\u2019ve got all my shots, wear masks whenever I go shopping or travel. But I\\u2019m not staying home. Still going to restaurants, plays, concerts and planning holiday trips. Think that\\u2019s irresponsible?\", \"Bret: I think it\\u2019s sane, necessary and courageous.\", \"Gail: Well, not expecting a badge for going to a jazz club, but thanks. Go on.\", \"Bret: We\\u2019re going to create the Order of the Birdland, just for you, Gail.\", \"Back to Covid: I think we should stop assuming we can make it go away, whether by locking down communities and shutting down borders or by rolling out new medicines. We can\\u2019t eliminate risk but we can mitigate it, especially by creating various kinds of accommodations for people with higher risk factors. Let\\u2019s hope vaccines and therapeutics will keep catching up with the new variants as they emerge and evolve. But the bottom line is that we still have to go on living as close to normal as possible: sending kids to school, letting them see friends, going to our jobs, socializing, eating at our favorite restaurants, consuming culture and all the rest.\", \"All of which is to say that it was a mistake for the Biden administration to shut down travel from some countries in Africa. We should be shutting down the shutdowns, period.\", \"Gail: Hmm. Don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m sure we shouldn\\u2019t take a little break on travel from Africa until scientists get more information on the newest variant.\", \"Bret: My guess is that it\\u2019s probably already here, sorry to say. In better news, Gail, there were the guilty verdicts in Georgia for the heinous murder of Ahmaud Arbery. Your thoughts \\u2026\", \"Gail: It was a relief to see a case where a nearly all-white jury came down so quickly on a horrible racist murder. The evidence was so clear, it\\u2019d be hard to imagine a different outcome. But as you may have noticed, we live in troubled times.\", \"Bret: A good reminder that, for all of our problems, there really has been meaningful racial progress in this country. I doubt you would have had the same verdict 50 years ago, and not just because one of the killers was dumb enough to film them committing the crime.\", \"Gail: Speaking of terrible crimes, how about that parade tragedy in Wisconsin, where, according to prosecutors, a driver named Darrell Brooks ran into the marchers and killed six people?\", \"Bret: Heartbreaking. And outrageous. Brooks had a rap sheet as long as an elephant\\u2019s trunk, and, reportedly, he had recently tried to run a woman over with the same Ford Escape he used in his rampage. Yet he was out on $1,000 bail. This seems crazy to me, not to mention politically suicidal for Democrats who keep pushing for bail reform.\", \"Gail: I\\u2019m not a fan of bail, period. Even when it comes to violent charges, the judge should just figure out whether the accused has a history that suggests he might strike again if he\\u2019s freed.\", \"If there\\u2019s a bad record, prisoner stays in jail and prosecution is obligated to move toward a quick trial. A guy like Brooks isn\\u2019t going to restrain himself because he\\u2019s out on $1,000 bail or $50,000 bail. If there\\u2019s no prior history of violence or serious threat of flight, the accused should be let go until he\\u2019s tried.\", \"But the problem is that reforming the system would be expensive.\", \"So, ahem, more government spending \\u2026\", \"Bret: OK, I\\u2019m intrigued. Please say a little more about where the money would have to be spent to make your idea work.\", \"Gail: Well, a lot more judges, court officers, public defenders and backup personnel to move the system along much faster. Not to mention the prison facilities we\\u2019d need to keep a whole lot more people confined until their trials.\", \"Bret: Maybe someone put ayahuasca in my coffee. I\\u2019m agreeing with you, Gail.\", \"Proponents of bail reform have one thing right in that it is outrageous to keep people who are owed a presumption of innocence locked up for months or years because they can\\u2019t afford bail. As you suggest, the answer is to give them their Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, which should take weeks or months, not years. If that requires billions in more spending, I\\u2019d support it.\", \"Gail: Happy holidays!\", \"Bret: There\\u2019s a bipartisan path to a better criminal-justice system that everyone from Donald Trump to Nancy Pelosi could get behind, including better prison conditions, which have become a disgrace in places like Rikers Island, and greater rehabilitative efforts within prison walls, including in-jail drug rehab. Where I think proponents of reform lose the plot is by arguing that people with demonstrated propensities to violence go free. All that would do is lead to outrages like the one in Waukesha while guaranteeing a public backlash against any form of reform at all.\", \"Another crime-related question for you, Gail: How do you feel about vigorously policing and prosecuting quality-of-life offenses, like public drug use or shoplifting?\", \"Gail: If the law \\u2014 and the system upholding it \\u2014 imposes the same penalty on people regardless of class, race or income, I\\u2019m probably good with it. If the punishment given to a homeless woman caught shoplifting is the same as the punishment given to a suburban teenager caught shoplifting, it isn\\u2019t going to be extreme.\", \"Bret: Fair point. But I\\u2019d still like to live in cities where people don\\u2019t feel free to smoke meth pipes next to Macy\\u2019s in broad daylight, homeless encampments don\\u2019t spring up beneath highway overpasses and drugstores don\\u2019t have to put toothpaste and other commonplace items behind locked cabinets to keep people from stealing them. In other words, not San Francisco. Liberals in particular should be for making cities livable, especially for their middle-class residents.\", \"Gail: Speaking of quality of life, our colleagues put together a very interesting quiz you can take to determine where you\\u2019re best suited to live. Mine came out with New York City at the top, and I\\u2019m very very happy to already be in my target town. Almost anybody who loves diversity, live music, restaurants and a car-free culture would be happy here. Presuming they happened to already have a comfortable and affordable living space. Just that one detail \\u2026\", \"Anyhow, wondering if you took the test and where you came out.\", \"Bret: The quiz didn\\u2019t seem to give me an option to leave the country, which is what our family did when we moved to Hamburg after Trump was elected in 2016, and what we will do again if he\\u2019s returned to office in three years. Thinking of either Taormina or Tel Aviv next time.\", \"Gail: Good advance planning, but I\\u2019m going for positivity.\", \"Bret: Anyway, according to the algorithm, San Diego is the perfect American city for me. Nice weather; lots of families; tilts conservative. But I\\u2019m not looking to move from my old farmhouse anytime soon, and barring another Trumpocalypse I would have a hard time living anywhere that\\u2019s more than 60 miles from Times Square.\", \"Gail: If \\u201cfarmhouse just outside of New York\\u201d was an option, pretty sure you could have gotten a majority of the quiz-takers.\", \"Bret: Unfortunately it comes with old farmhouse problems. We have a poltergeist in the attic and a basement worthy of a \\u201cSilence of the Lambs\\u201d sequel.\", \"Speaking of Times Square, that was sad news about Stephen Sondheim passing away last week. Talk about genius! A friend of mine with an ear for melody and a gift for language sent me a song from \\u201cMerrily We Roll Along\\u201d that she thought was apropos of our weekly chats:\", \"Gail: Love the way you think. Sing. Or actually, both. This can be our Sondheim season.\"]","href_hash":"902742c6510011ec84ad8b2c0031a03f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"902742c6510011ec84ad8b2c0031a03f"}},
