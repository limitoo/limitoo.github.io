Government officials said they had the power to overturn it.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-01-06T01:45:59.000Z","content":"[\"Was there ever a doubt that Novak Djokovic, jab or no jab, would end up in Melbourne this month to defend his Australian Open title?\", \"Not seemingly among his competitors. Many of them figured as soon as the tournament announced late last year that players could apply for a medical exemption from the Covid-19 inoculation requirement that officials would find a way for Djokovic, the vaccine-averse, 20-time Grand Slam tournament champion, to compete for a record 10th title in Australia.\", \"And when that exemption came through on Tuesday, and Djokovic, a Serb ranked No. 1, posted a picture of himself on Twitter announcing his imminent departure for Australia, reaction among the pro tennis elite ranged from skeptical to inspired.\", \"There was this exchange from Alex de Minaur and James Duckworth, both of Australia, after they lost their singles matches in the ATP Cup, a team tournament in Sydney.\", \"\\u201cIf he\\u2019s fit the criteria, then, yeah, he should be able to come,\\u201d Duckworth said.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s very politically correct of you,\\u201d de Minaur said with a laugh. \\u201cAs James has very wisely put out there, I think he\\u2019s said all the right things there. Look, I just think it\\u2019s just very interesting, that\\u2019s all I\\u2019m going to say.\\u201d\", \"By Wednesday, Australian politicians were weighing in. The minister for home affairs, Karen Andrews, released a statement that suggested the government could revoke Djokovic\\u2019s exemption, and the country\\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, said health officials expected to see evidence that Djokovic merited his exemption, and threatened to put the tennis star \\u201con the next plane home\\u201d if he did not meet the strict requirements for one.\", \"\\u201cWe await his presentation and what evidence he provides us to support that,\\u201d Morrison said. \\u201cIf that evidence is insufficient, then he won\\u2019t be treated any different to anyone else and he\\u2019ll be on the next plane home. There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all.\\u201d\", \"Djokovic, who is tied with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer for the most Grand Slam men\\u2019s singles titles, has long held some nontraditional views of science and medicine (he once asserted that prayer and belief could purify toxic water) and has had a complicated relationship with the pandemic.\", \"In June 2020, when sports were still largely shut down, and long before experts deemed it safe for people to gather and for large events to take place, Djokovic organized a series of exhibition matches in Serbia and Croatia and invited several of the world\\u2019s top players to participate. They obliged, and several of them became infected with the coronavirus, including Djokovic.\", \"Eventually, vaccines became available and a debate ensued about requiring tennis players to get inoculated, to protect themselves, tennis fans and tournament organizers, since the tours are an 11-month journey around the world. Djokovic was adamantly against this. He has long said vaccination is a private and personal decision that should not be mandated.\", \"This placed him at odds with his chief rivals, Federer and Nadal, who are vaccinated. Just last month, Nadal said he did not have a position on a mandate but deferred to the experts who said vaccines were the best way to protect everyone.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t pretend to know more than what the authorized people say,\\u201d Nadal said last month during his preparation for the Australian Open in the United Arab Emirates. He tested positive for the coronavirus upon his return to Spain. \\u201cIf the people who really know about it say that we need to be vaccinated, who I am to create a different opinion?\\u201d\", \"Throughout last year, the WTA, the professional women\\u2019s tour, and the ATP, the men\\u2019s circuit, did not require a vaccination, though players often have had to adhere to staying within a strict bubblelike environment as they hopscotched the world.\", \"But then the Australian Open announced a vaccine would be required to gain entry into the country. Djokovic\\u2019s father referred to the mandate as \\u201cblackmail.\\u201d A confrontation between tournament organizers and Novak Djokovic appeared inevitable, producing mixed emotions at the top of the game.\", \"Djokovic\\u2019s absence would make it easier for his rivals to win. But while he is not exactly close with Federer or Nadal, he is extremely popular among many top players, including leading members of the so-called next generation like Alexander Zverev of Germany, Daniil Medvedev of Russia and Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece, who also happen to be his neighbors in Monte Carlo.\", \"\\u201cHopefully the Australian government will make an exemption or whatever it is that they can do for him to be able to participate there,\\u201d Zverev said in November at the ATP Finals in Italy.\", \"Such an exemption had the potential to become a political hornet\\u2019s nest in Australia. The country has waged one of the most successful battles against Covid-19, but it has come at a steep price. Strict lockdowns have lasted for months. International borders were largely closed until recently. Inbound travelers had to adhere to an expensive, two-week quarantine upon arrival. For long periods, even domestic travel between states was also prohibited. The country has experienced only 2,200 deaths, but since opening its borders late last year it is now dealing with more than 30,000 cases a day.\", \"As the Australian Open approached, though, Craig Tiley, the tournament director, announced that in accordance with the government of Victoria, the state that contains Melbourne, there would be an independent review process to consider possible medical exemptions for unvaccinated players who had a \\u201cgenuine reason.\\u201d\", \"Players had to pass muster with two panels of medical experts. The process included the redaction of personal information to ensure privacy, but that emphasis on privacy also meant that the panel and the tournament did not release any justification for exempting Djokovic.\", \"In a statement Tuesday, Tiley said: \\u201cFair and independent protocols were established for assessing medical exemption applications that will enable us to ensure Australian Open 2022 is safe and enjoyable for everyone. Central to this process was that the decisions were made by independent medical experts and that every applicant was given due consideration.\\u201d\", \"Not everyone in the game believed that.\", \"\\u201cI think if it was me that wasn\\u2019t vaccinated I wouldn\\u2019t be getting an exemption,\\u201d Jamie Murray of Britain said on Tuesday after his ATP Cup doubles match. \\u201cBut well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete.\\u201d\", \"In a week and a half, Djokovic will do just that.\"]","href_hash":"290920126ed511ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"290920126ed511ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
