But even as the country estimates that about 200,000 people a day are being infected with Omicron, a record number of Conservative lawmakers voted against Prime Minister Boris Johnson\\u2019s plan. It was a striking rebuke to their leader at a time when he has called for a national campaign to prevent Omicron from swamping the country.\", \"Opposition to the plan focused mainly on what critics described as \\u201cvaccine passports\\u201d but the government called a \\u201cCovid certification\\u201d policy. The new regulation requires people entering nightclubs, large indoor venues and some sporting events in England to show proof of vaccination or of a recent negative Covid test.\", \"Nearly 40 Conservatives also rebelled against the government\\u2019s plan to expand the compulsory use of face masks. Lawmakers passed a measure requiring health workers to be vaccinated.\", \"There are many explanations for the paradoxical vote, my colleagues Mark Landler and Stephen Castle report, including Britain\\u2019s cherished tradition of protecting individual liberties and a deep sense of fatigue with a government that has lurched from policy to policy during the pandemic.\", \"But while Conservatives have long been skeptical of lockdowns, the insurgents have been joined by some lawmakers who argue that Covid certificates will do little to stop Omicron.\", \"Indeed, the government today relaxed one restriction, removing all 11 countries from its \\u201cred list,\\u201d which required travelers to quarantine in hotels after they arrive in Britain. The decision essentially acknowledges that Omicron has spread so widely that the restrictions no longer matter.\", \"The rebellion among Conservative lawmakers \\u2014 the worst since Johnson\\u2019s landslide victory in 2019 \\u2014 attests to his weakened political standing, which public health experts say has dire epidemiological implications.\", \"Devi Sridhar, head of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh, said it was \\u201cpolitically difficult for the PM now to have any authority to put in place necessary protections.\\u201d\", \"Britain is mainly tightening rules to encourage more people to get inoculated (roughly 30 percent of the population is not yet fully vaccinated). Defenders of vaccine passes say they have driven up vaccination rates in France and Italy. But they have also ignited protests in both countries, with critics calling them discriminatory.\", \"Pfizer announced today that a highly anticipated study of the company\\u2019s Covid pill confirmed that it helps stave off severe disease. Lab studies also showed that the pill worked against the Omicron variant.\", \"The pill, Paxlovid, reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 89 percent if given within three days of the onset of symptoms. If given within five days, the risk was reduced by 88 percent.\", \"Pfizer said the pill held up against Omicron by jamming into one of its key proteins, called a protease, just as effectively as it does with other variants. Omicron is surging in South Africa and Europe and is expected to dominate U.S. cases in the weeks ahead.\", \"Last month, Pfizer asked the F.D.A. to authorize the pill based on a preliminary batch of data. The new results will undoubtedly strengthen the company\\u2019s application, which means that Americans infected with the virus could have access to the pill within weeks.\", \"More Omicron news:\", \"Today\\u2019s questions on testing and the variant go to Carl Zimmer, who covers science for The Times. (If you have a question, you can fill out this form.)\", \"Are rapid at-home Covid-19 virus test kits effective in detecting Omicron? \\u2014 P. Zamora, San Francisco\", \"Yes, at-home antigen tests will tell you if you have the coronavirus, regardless of the variant. But rapid at-home tests tell you only if you have SARS-CoV-2 or not. They don\\u2019t tell you which variant you have. Standard PCR tests won\\u2019t tell you, either.\", \"If at-home Covid tests produce a positive result, should one then get professionally tested, perhaps placing others at risk, or just isolate and treat at home? \\u2014 Abbe Herbst, Bronx, N.Y.\", \"A PCR test is a good idea following a positive antigen test. You can go through a drive-through window to avoid putting others at risk.\", \"Let us know how you\\u2019re dealing with the pandemic.
