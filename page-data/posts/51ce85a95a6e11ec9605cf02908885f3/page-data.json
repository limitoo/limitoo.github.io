His dandyish Oscar Wilde jackets. His Capri-ready neck scarves and Janis Joplin sunglasses.\", \"It is not easy to stand out in a documentary featuring four of the 20th century\\u2019s most famous people. But with his flair for accessories and slinky-pants-cool, Mr. Johns has found a new round of appreciators a half century after the fact.\", \"\\u201cGlyn Johns is the late \\u201960s fashion icon I didn\\u2019t know I needed,\\u201d tweeted Katie Irish, a costume designer who worked on \\u201cThe Americans.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cGlyn Johns in the fluffy jacket is my look for the rest of winter,\\u201d said Emma Swift, an Australian singer and songwriter, on Twitter. Others have noted his uncanny resemblance to Liam Gallagher of Oasis; Cillian Murphy, the star of \\u201cPeaky Blinders;\\u201d and Ronnie (Z-Man) Barzell, the debauched rock impresario in the 1970 camp classic, \\u201cBeyond the Valley of the Dolls.\\u201d\", \"For Mr. Johns, 79, the experience has been amusing \\u2014 to a point.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m fed up with it now, I\\u2019ll tell you,\\u201d he said with a laugh in a telephone call from his home in Chichester, England. \\u201cI have 9,000 emails and texts from people from my past, all taking the Mickey unmercifully.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSome people are saying, \\u2018Oh, the jacket you wore on X day was fantastic,\\u2019 or \\u2018Where did you get the goatskin coat?\\u2019 But in general, they\\u2019re laughing at how ridiculous I looked, which of course is true.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Johns was hardly the only peacock during those fateful weeks, as the Beatles labored to get over their differences and get back to their roots with a no-nonsense rock n\\u2019 roll album, accompanied, in theory, by a concert television special.\", \"While John Lennon and Paul McCartney generally seemed to be dressed for comfort, befitting long hours toiling in the studio, Ringo Starr showed up to one session in a lime-green pinstriped suit with a forest green musketeer shirt. George Harrison, wore a similar ensemble in pink and purple. (Fashion sites including W and Marie Claire have offered guides on how to shop the looks in \\u201cGet Back.\\u201d)\", \"In such company, it is a little surprising that Mr. Johns has garnered so much attention. He was already an industry heavyweight, who would later become the go-to sound man for The Who, Eric Clapton, the Eagles and many others. But at that point, Mr. Johns was anything but a Beatles insider. He was associated with the Rolling Stones, whom he had worked with since the early days. In fact, when the Beatles first reached out to him, he was dubious.\", \"\\u201cI was at home on a very rare night off and the phone rang, and the person on the other end announced themselves in a Liverpudlian accent as being Paul McCartney,\\u201d he said. Mr. Johns thought it was Mick Jagger pulling a practical joke, so he told him to get lost, albeit in saltier language.\", \"\\u201cAnd of course there was silence on the other end of the phone,\\u201d Mr. Johns added. \\u201cHe started all over again, and I thought, \\u2018Oh, it is Paul McCartney, Jesus Christ!\\u201d\", \"The Stones\\u2019 fashion influence on Mr. Johns is undeniable. \\u201cI remember Brian Jones taking me to a store in Carnaby Street once, and we bought stuff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI remember Mick gave me a fabulous shirt.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe coolest thing I think I wore in the film was the crocodile Levi jacket, which in fact had been given to me by Keith Richards,\\u201d he added. \\u201cWe were in Paris, and Keith had this jacket made for him in France, and it had been delivered to the hotel. He took it out of the packaging, put it on and said, \\u2018Here you have it, I don\\u2019t want it.\\u2019 I have no idea what happened to it. Maybe I gave it away.\\u201d\", \"Nor can he remember where he got the goatskin coat that viewers are obsessed with, although he does remember how it smelled after a rainstorm.\", \"\\u201cI distinctly remember queuing for an airplane wearing that coat, and the people in front and behind me moved away from me because it actually stank,\\u201d Mr. Johns said. \\u201cAnd of course in those days, if you had long hair you were suspect anyway.\\u201d\", \"Fans rightly laud Mr. Johns\\u2019s looks in the film as the epitome of \\u201960s British rocker cool, and the costume-like whimsy he (and various Beatles at various times) display in \\u201cGet Back\\u201d has all the color and exuberance of the peak-psychedelia moment.\", \"By 1969, however, rock was taking a harder, darker turn, as evidenced by the Rolling Stones\\u2019 \\u201cLet it Bleed\\u201d and Led Zeppelin\\u2019s eponymous first album (both of which Mr. Johns worked on), not to mention Beatles songs like, yes, \\u201cGet Back.\\u201d\", \"The Beatles\\u2019 public image was starting to reflect that. For the cover shot of \\u201cAbbey Road,\\u201d taken on Aug. 8 of that year (coincidentally, the same day four members of the Manson family set out for Sharon Tate\\u2019s house in Los Angeles.) Mr. McCartney and Mr. Starr opted for somber navy and black, Mr. Lennon blank-slate white and Mr. Harrison, \\u201cgravedigger\\u201d denim \\u2014 at least according to the viral Paul-is-dead conspiracy theory of the day.\", \"Nor did the Beatles seem to gussy themselves up much for their last public appearance on a London rooftop \\u2014 the climax of \\u201cGet Back.\\u201d\", \"Gone were the Technicolor satins. Mr. McCartney was basically dressed for the office in a somber black three-piece suit and open-collar shirt. Mr. Lennon, in sneakers, and Mr. Starr went minimalist black-on-black, although the former wore a fur coat borrowed from Yoko Ono and the latter, his wife Maureen\\u2019s bright red raincoat, presumably to gird themselves against the winter chill. George Harrison looked somewhat festive, if a little thrift-store chic, in bright green pants and a grizzly-like Mongolian lamb-fur coat. And then of course there was the ever-present Ms. Ono herself, in her ever-present black.\", \"A traditional analysis was that the Beatles had stopped putting on showbiz airs by then because they were bickering over money and management, and were headed toward a breakup. That view became canonical after the release of \\u201cLet It Be,\\u201d the downbeat 1970 documentary by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who plays a prominent role in \\u201cGet Back,\\u201d and captured the hours of unseen footage that appears in the series.\", \"To Mr. Johns and many others, \\u201cLet It Be\\u201d has all the joy of a divorce proceeding.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s awful, terrible,\\u201d Mr. Johns said of the earlier film. \\u201cMy memory was that we actually had a really good time and everybody got on great. The fact that George left the band for 24 hours is no different from any other band I ever worked with, or anyone who works in an office. People who work together for years on end, they fall out, and they patch it up at the end. It\\u2019s normal.\\u201d\", \"He would never have guessed the Beatles were heading toward a split.\", \"\\u201cThe four of them had gone through this mammoth experience, from when they were unknown, to being four of the most famous people in the world,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere was this massive bond between them. They were like family, really.\\u201d\", \"He recalls a lot less about what he was wearing, and why.\", \"\\u201cListen, mate, it was 50 years ago, how can I remember?\\u201d Mr. Johns said with a laugh. \\u201cEveryone has a style of their own, I suppose. But I was busy working.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"51ce85a95a6e11ec9605cf02908885f3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"51ce85a95a6e11ec9605cf02908885f3"}},
