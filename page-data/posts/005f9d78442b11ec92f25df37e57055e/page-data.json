For a long time \\u2014 like people in the rest of Canada, and around the world \\u2014 their predicament was due to the pandemic.\", \"But lately, the trouble has come from a new source \\u2014 a catastrophic cyberattack. The system ground to a halt on Oct. 30. On Friday, the province\\u2019s four health authorities were predicting that treatment delays and disruptions would begin easing on Monday, although they would persist in some emergency departments and not all elective surgeries and chemotherapy treatments would return to normal. \", \"And this week, the province revealed that the attack was worse than previously reported. On Friday, John Hogan, the provincial justice minister, said that employee information at three local health authorities had been stolen. Two days earlier, officials said that personal information of patients and health care workers, some of it health-related, had been \\u201caccessed\\u201d during the attack.\", \"It was, in short, a cyberattack that theoretically affected everyone in the province.\", \"But good luck finding out what happened or what\\u2019s going on to remedy it. The government of Premier Andrew Furey, who is also an orthopedic surgeon, won\\u2019t even describe the variety of the cyberattack. \", \"\\u201cOur advice from world-class experts is to say nothing,\\u201d John Haggie, Newfoundland\\u2019s health minister, told a news conference on Wednesday. Nor will the government reveal who those experts are that the province brought in to solve its problem.\", \"The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, without revealing its source, reported that the shutdown was the latest in a string of ransomware attacks that have hit other health-related institutions, corporations and governments during the pandemic. Such attacks developed about a decade or so ago. The attacks, which appear to often come out of Russia, simply involve seizing control of data on vulnerable computer systems, encrypting it and then threatening to destroy it unless a ransom is paid, usually in bitcoin. \", \"Three hospitals in Ontario were victims of such attacks in October 2019. They have disrupted individuals\\u2019 personal computers, and early this year they created diesel and jet fuel shortages in the United States after a pipeline company fell victim to hackers. \", \"I spoke with Nicolas Papernot, an assistant professor of computer science and computer engineering at the University of Toronto. While he is an internationally known expert on cybersecurity and privacy, he\\u2019s not among Newfoundland\\u2019s advisers and has no inside knowledge of its situation.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know why they don\\u2019t give more information,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut they should at least give a warning to people who are potentially affected, even if they are conservative in how they estimate whether a person was or was not impacted by the leakage of information.\\u201d\", \"The computer networks of provincial and regional health care systems in Canada are particularly susceptible to hackers because they generally contain large numbers of outdated \\u201clegacy\\u201d software systems, Professor Papernot said.\", \"\\u201cThose tend to carry vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer systems but that can still be exploited because these systems are too old to be maintained at current security standards,\\u201d he said.\", \"Compounding the threat has been the mass move to working from home, he added. Many governments and corporations have yet to address the security threats posed by remote access, failing to put into place additional security measures, like two-factor identification, or training employees on spotting malicious email.\", \"Newfoundland\\u2019s mess appears to be the largest disruption any health system has seen in Canada. But other governments have not been immune to major cyberattacks. Ten years ago, workers in the federal government\\u2019s department of finance and its treasury board were without internet access for months following a cyber attack. \", \"That same year, the Communications Security Establishment, the highly secretive eavesdropping service, was pulled out of the military and made into a separate agency. It currently operates the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, which, among other things, looks for threats to governments and corporations in Canada and offers advice on security.\", \"In an email, Ryan Foreman, a spokesman for the agency, told me that it has \\u201cnoticed an increase in cyber threats related to the Covid-19 pandemic, including threats directed against the country\\u2019s frontline health care and medical research facilities,\\u201d and that it has been working closely with security officials in health systems.\", \"The cybersecurity agency confirmed that it is providing Newfoundland with digital forensics services, data recovery and general guidance. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, it said, is also investigating the attack.\", \"But what, exactly, is going on there? \\u201cWe are unable to comment further on the nature of our assistance with the province due to operational security reasons,\\u201d the spokesman wrote.\", \"A native of Windsor, Ontario, Ian Austen was educated in Toronto, lives in Ottawa and has reported about Canada for The New York Times for the past 16 years. Follow him on Twitter at @ianrausten.\", \"How are we doing?We\\u2019re eager to have your thoughts about this newsletter and events in Canada in general. Please send them to nytcanada@nytimes.com.\", \"Like this email?Forward it to your friends, and let them know they can sign up here.\"]","href_hash":"005f9d78442b11ec92f25df37e57055e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"005f9d78442b11ec92f25df37e57055e"}},
