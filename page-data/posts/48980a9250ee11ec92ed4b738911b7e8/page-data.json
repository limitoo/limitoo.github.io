The music was fresh, the movies were dope and the hair was big. The cars? Rad, then and now. Maybe especially now.\", \"In the 1980s and \\u201990s, cars were boxy and far-out, futuristic and often a bit funky. Then came a new millennium and the internet era, and the previous two decades quickly felt dated. Eventually, all those \\u201cBack to the Future\\u201d angles gave way to cars with more timeless, sloping silhouettes. The coolest cars of the \\u201980s and \\u201990s \\u2014 the DeLoreans and Countachs, Audi\\u2019s Quattro and Nissan\\u2019s 300ZX \\u2014 faded away like a photo of Marty McFly.\", \"But with time comes nostalgia, and Gen Xers and millennials are moving forward in their lives and careers, with greater ability to spend on a hobby like collecting cars. And so the forgotten-about cars they grew up with are gaining new respect, and pushing up prices.\", \"A group called RADwood has tapped into this vein, putting on auto shows with a dash of cosplay dress-up throughout the year and across the country. The aim is to capture \\u201cthe essence of a bodacious era,\\u201d as its website puts it. The shows, it says, are \\u201ca celebration of \\u201980s and \\u201990s lifestyle, blending period correct dress with automotive awesomeness.\\u201d\", \"Art Cervantes, a founder and the chief executive of RADwood, said he had set out to celebrate all cars of this era. \\u201cThings began with an announcement on the \\u2018Driving While Awesome\\u2019 podcast (whose hosts form three of the five founding members of RADwood) back in the spring of 2017,\\u201d he said via email. The name and concept are a play on the Goodwood Revival, an annual festival outside London that highlights a different era, the mid-1940s to 1966, and a different slice of the automotive world: British racing.\", \"The RADwood team\\u2019s plan at the start was simple: \\u201cBring your \\u201980s and \\u201990s cars to a park on the San Francisco Bay and dress the part,\\u201d Mr. Cervantes said. (Think acid-washed jeans, rolled at the ankle; neon makeup; and huge hair.)\", \"\\u201cTo everyone\\u2019s surprise,\\u201d he said, \\u201c150 cars and 500 people showed up.\\u201d\", \"That first RADwood in 2017 struck a nerve. However, Mr. Cervantes didn\\u2019t know then that they had helped spearhead \\u201ca major generational shift in automotive culture,\\u201d he said.\", \"RADwood has expanded to many U.S. metro areas, along with one show in Britain, and its average attendance is about 3,500, Mr. Cervantes said. The group has plans for 10 U.S. shows next year, and smaller events pop up at other big automotive festivals.\", \"Its biggest event was held just before the pandemic struck, in February 2020 in Austin, Texas: over 700 cars and 7,000 people. The pandemic clipped the momentum, and events this year were scaled back. The company also curbed its growth plans, including expanding its auction site for cars and memorabilia, which it intends to focus on more at year-end.\", \"With all this attention, in certain circles \\u201cRADwood\\u201d is a catchphrase symbolizing this era\\u2019s choicest rides.\", \"Colin Pan was at a RADwood show near Seattle in September. \\u201cWhen I was in school for automotive design, major car shows were either big-budget product launch events or had high-end classic cars with a high entry level,\\u201d he said. Any shows focused on RADwood\\u2019s era were \\u201csmall gatherings of some particular group or makes,\\u201d he added.\", \"But at the September show and elsewhere, \\u201cmost people who own these cars are people around my age, in the 20s-40s group,\\u201d said Mr. Pan, a 32-year-old industrial designer who lives in Gig Harbor, Wash.\", \"\\u201cMany are getting cars for nostalgic reasons,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut cars of this era are just beginning to be considered as classics, yet still modern enough to be understandable and be worked on.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Pan has owned several rad cars, including his current prize, a 1992 Toyota Starlet GT Turbo that was sold for the Japanese market. He bought it, for $3,000 in 2020, in stock condition. The Starlet was Mr. Pan\\u2019s pandemic lockdown project, he said, and he tricked it out to get it fit for racing.\", \"The cars that turn heads at RADwood aren\\u2019t everyone\\u2019s cup of New Coke. Cody Redfern\\u2019s 1986 Subaru XT Turbo coupe is affectionately known as the \\u201cWonder Wedge.\\u201d It\\u2019s got more angles than a high school geometry test.\", \"\\u201cWhen I first saw this car it just drew me into the nostalgia,\\u201d said Mr. Redfern, a 33-year-old auto parts store associate and movie buff from Everett, Wash.\", \"\\u201cI honestly love everything about \\u201980s and \\u201990s cars,\\u201d he said, \\u201cespecially the J.D.M. community,\\u201d for Japanese domestic market. His first exposure, he said, was the \\u201cFast and the Furious\\u201d movie in 2001, inspiring him to grab a wrench.\", \"Mr. Redfern loves the eccentric mix of rad-era cars; he\\u2019s part of a younger community of car enthusiasts who have a passion for those vehicles for their weirdness and unique features.\", \"\\u201cYou get to see daily-driven cars to exotics and supercars,\\u201d he said. At RADwood, he said, \\u201ceveryone there is all about showing the cars we grew up with some love.\\u201d\", \"Kyle Saito\\u2019s favorite generation of cars aligns with RADwood\\u2019s mission. He owns \\u201ca 1980 Datsun 720 pickup truck project vehicle and a 1995 Isuzu Trooper,\\u201d said Mr. Saito, who is 36 and lives in Seattle. He also owns a customized 1991 right-hand-drive Nissan Patrol S.U.V. off-roader.\", \"He started working on cars at his high school\\u2019s auto shop \\u2014 and has been an enthusiast ever since.\", \"\\u201cThe 1980s birthed the era of high-horsepower turbocharged fuel-injected racecars,\\u201d said Mr. Saito, who spent a decade working on cars. Now he is an engineer for Amazon\\u2019s drone delivery program and is working on a start-up manufacturing firearms accessories.\", \"RADwood, he added, \\u201chelps to preserve not only the vehicles of those eras but helps in the preservation, education and feeling of the time.\\u201d\", \"Although many \\u201980s and \\u201990s vehicles can be bought for a song, Mr. Saito\\u2019s stick-shift, four-wheel-drive Nissan Patrol set him back $21,000 two years ago \\u2014 in fair condition. Prices are beginning to climb as these cars become collectibles instead of simply \\u201cused.\\u201d And he has put in substantial work to bring it up to modern standards. He has cleaned up and repaired its body, added performance and suspension upgrades and even outfitted the inside for overnighting.\", \"\\u201cRADwood vehicles,\\u201d he said, \\u201cnot only make me feel nostalgia but a sense of pride and respect for being a part of such important decades of vehicle development and styling.\\u201d\", \"Casey Rhodes, an aerospace technician from Portland, Ore., had plans to attend the Seattle-area show but couldn\\u2019t make it. He said he supported the whole vibe of RADwood.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve always loved cars built in the \\u201980s and \\u201990s,\\u201d said Mr. Rhodes, who goes by thekrustykaddy on Instagram. \\u201cThe \\u201980s just drew me in by the way they looked and sounded, not to mention the big-body aspect of those years.\\u201d\", \"The RADwood era brought about long-lasting classics like Michael Jackson\\u2019s \\u201cThriller\\u201d and Nike\\u2019s Air Jordans. \\u201cIt was a classic decade for cars,\\u201d too, said Mr. Rhodes, who at 26 comes to his nostalgia from a different age bracket.\", \"\\u201cMy first two cars,\\u201d he said, \\u201chappened to be a 1986 Chevrolet C10 Silverado and, a few years later, a 1996 Lexus SC.\\u201d The vehicles are 10 years, and worlds, apart.\", \"But soon the Volkswagen bug would bite the family. His father would share stories about his \\u201980s-era Volkswagen Golf Mk1. His older brother bought a 1983 Rabbit GTI. So in March 2019, Mr. Rhodes bought a barely running 1981 VW Rabbit pickup for $2,700 \\u2014 from a field where it had been left to die.\", \"\\u201cAfter the purchase I was so hyped I drove up to a local meet,\\u201d he said. However, he forgot to check oil, coolant and other pertinent items.\", \"It turned out the oil was low and the coolant in the reservoir nonexistent. Additionally, only two lug nuts held on each wheel. The exhaust system promptly fell off on his way home.\"]","href_hash":"48980a9250ee11ec92ed4b738911b7e8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"48980a9250ee11ec92ed4b738911b7e8"}},
