Here’s how to navigate it.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-18T20:19:28.000Z","content":"[\"Even before the Covid pandemic, Thanksgiving could be an emotional minefield for many families.\", \"Tensions over the 2016 presidential election led some families to shorten Thanksgiving dinner that year to avoid conflict; others cut ties altogether with relatives whose politics differed. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll from 2016 found that one-third of respondents said they had gotten into a \\u201cheated\\u201d argument with family or friends in the wake of the presidential election.\", \"The pandemic has created only more divides. Now that most American adults have been vaccinated against Covid, many families are having their first winter holiday gatherings in two years. It should be a joyous occasion. But some people are not inviting unvaccinated family members to Thanksgiving; others are scoffing at relatives who insist on masks.\", \"\\u201cNow it\\u2019s no longer whether you just disagree about the long-term effects of climate change,\\u201d said Jill Suitor, a sociologist at Purdue University, where she leads a project investigating family conflict in 550 multigenerational families, \\u201cbut whether you believe that having certain family members present poses a serious danger to other family members.\\u201d\", \"According to the Pew Research Center, 77 percent of Americans believe the country has become more polarized since the pandemic \\u2014 which is saying something, given that before the pandemic, 40 percent of people on both sides of the political aisle considered the other side \\u201cdownright evil.\\u201d\", \"The good news is that it\\u2019s possible to navigate this year\\u2019s unique holiday conflicts gracefully. Doing so requires understanding what\\u2019s really driving family tension this year, both political and personal. In many cases, according to psychologists, those classic fights about politics or where to spend Christmas are really about something much deeper, especially in 2021: a yearning for love, connection and, above all, belonging.\", \"Psychologists have been studying belonging for decades. In a seminal paper published in 1995, the social psychologists Roy Baumeister and Mark Leary argued that human beings have a powerful need to belong that largely stems from our evolutionary origins.\", \"People feel a sense of belonging, according to Dr. Baumeister and Dr. Leary, when they have frequent positive interactions with others that are based on mutual care. With true belonging, you are valued for who you are intrinsically, and you value the other person in turn.\", \"During the holidays, the yearning for belonging is supercharged. Jeanne Safer, a psychoanalyst in New York who specializes in family conflict, told me that many of her patients romanticize the holidays. They have a fantasy about what family life should be at this time of year \\u2014 loving, happy, accepting and warm. When loved ones gather, they desperately want the fantasy to play out, hoping that old childhood wounds and unresolved issues will be healed. \\u201cMaybe this time, my parents will understand me. Maybe this time, my in-laws will accept me.\\u201d That fantasy is especially potent this year after so much time apart.\", \"But such high hopes and expectations are usually dashed. There are so many opportunities to feel rejected during the holidays \\u2014 and every encounter can become a referendum on how loved you are (or aren\\u2019t).\", \"This year, those personal tensions have a pandemic twist. Maybe someone comments on your decision to send your children back to school or on how your body has changed after so much time at home. \\u201cAfter two years apart due to the pandemic,\\u201d wrote the reporter Kimmy Yan on Twitter, \\u201cmy family is reuniting tonight. Now taking bets on whether my parents are gonna say I\\u2019m too fat or too skinny.\\u201d\", \"Beneath these comments lies the sting of feeling rejected at the very moment you\\u2019re craving love most. Rejection is the opposite of belonging \\u2014 and psychologists have found that experiences of rejection, no matter how small, are extremely painful. Research has shown that feeling rejected activates the physical pain centers in the brain. Whether it\\u2019s being snubbed by our in-laws or criticized by our parents, rejection literally hurts.\", \"The pain of rejection is also why political discussions can become so hostile. Fights over issues like masking and vaccine mandates are not just expressions of tribal allegiance, as is often claimed, but also ways that family members seek to be understood and accepted, especially by loved ones who hold different beliefs.\", \"In her book \\u201cI Love You, but I Hate Your Politics,\\u201d Dr. Safer writes that children fight with parents about politics because they want to be \\u201cseen, heard and appreciated\\u201d for who they are; parents fight because they feel \\u201cbetrayed by differences and interpret them as repudiations.\\u201d Because political values are increasingly a central part of people\\u2019s sense of identity, rejecting a loved one\\u2019s politics has become a personal slight. It means rejecting them.\", \"The vaccine dispute has become a way to communicate acceptance and rejection.\", \"\\u201cFor the vaccinated,\\u201d Dr. Suitor explained, \\u201cthe unvaxxed family member\\u2019s commitment may seem like a blatant disregard for their life and health\\u201d \\u2014 an uncaring stance. \\u201cAnd the unvaxxed family member,\\u201d she continued, \\u201ccan be made to feel like a pariah or social outcast.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Safer tells her patients to avoid political discussions during the holidays. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a dead end. If you\\u2019re looking for complete acceptance and total understanding, if you\\u2019re hoping to change people\\u2019s mind,\\u201d she said, \\u201cdon\\u2019t go.\\u201d\", \"That advice, though, might be difficult to follow this year as people adjust their guest lists based on vaccine status. The vaccine discussion may be inevitable in the lead-up to the gathering, Dr. Safer said, but after you have it, banish politics from the conversation at the table.\", \"Even more effective than avoiding politics, perhaps, is extending grace to one another. This means assuming good faith, despite how annoying or passive-aggressive family members are acting, according to John and Julie Gottman, psychologists specializing in marriage and relationships who run the Gottman Institute. The Gottmans told me that a family member\\u2019s critical barb or resentful behavior is not always an expression of contempt and rejection. Quite the opposite: It\\u2019s often a bid for connection.\", \"Usually, bids for connection are more positive \\u2014 one person inviting another to go for a walk or to watch a football game. But some people lash out when they want attention.\", \"\\u201cPeople carry around a lot of hurts,\\u201d Julie Gottman said, \\u201cand hurts are like smoke: They leak under the door and come out even when you\\u2019re trying to be positive.\\u201d\", \"Someone might want to spend time with you, John Gottman explained, but instead of saying, \\u201cLet\\u2019s catch up\\u201d or \\u201cHow are you really doing?\\u201d the person will say, \\u201cYou\\u2019re so ungrateful\\u201d or \\u201cYou never call me.\\u201d\", \"They recommend that the recipient of such a bid recognize it as a plea for connection and respond with kindness. Doing so will not be not easy, especially after all the challenges of the past two years.\", \"\\u201cBut,\\u201d Julie Gottman said, \\u201cwe have to make an extra effort to practice our best compassion during the holidays.\\u201d\", \"Our loved ones are imperfect; so are we. That means that feelings are going to be hurt this year and that efforts to express love are going to be clumsy, awkward or marred by pride and stubbornness. Though the pandemic has increased tensions within families, it has also created an opening. Now more than ever, people are recognizing the importance of being together \\u2014 and how precious and fleeting life can be. Keeping these blessings in mind might inspire us to lead with love this holiday season.\"]","href_hash":"b8b8d90f48ac11ecb89027efb85fd470"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b8b8d90f48ac11ecb89027efb85fd470"}},
