Unfortunately, I came up empty-handed. I have many ideas for how we might improve democracy in the United States, but it is genuinely difficult for me to envision the path from A to B, from the status quo \\u2014 with its entrenched interests and strong bias against change \\u2014 to something more equal and inclusive.\", \"With that said, in thinking through Drutman\\u2019s question, I reminded myself of a truism that\\u2019s worth repeating here: For as much as we might predict and project, the future is, and always will be, an undiscovered country.\", \"We imagine the road ahead of us as a clear path. We seem to forget that, no matter how strong our powers of perception, we can\\u2019t actually see every obstacle in our way, predict the detours we\\u2019ll have to take or know when events force us on a different route entirely.\", \"Another way to think of this is that no one in 1928 had any inkling of what the next 20 years would bring. In retrospect, of course, we can see the lines leading to depression and war, and the transformation of the world economic and political order. But in the moment, we\\u2019re all moving blind.\", \"It is very possible, even likely, that American democracy continues on its present path to something dark and dangerous. That the authoritarian movement around Donald Trump continues to gain strength and that there\\u2019s little appetite among rival elites to do anything about it.\", \"For as much as there are patterns and precedents, for as much as the past can be a guide to the future, it is also true that history turns on a dime, that something might happen \\u2014 a crisis or a conflict or something else entirely \\u2014 that sweeps the pieces from the board and begins the game anew.\", \"I do not know how we get from the current morass to a healthy, robust democracy. But whatever force or event that brings us there, I do not think we\\u2019ll be able to see it in advance.\", \"My Tuesday column used the controversy over the term \\u201cLatinx\\u201d \\u2014 or rather, the conversation over its impact on the electorate \\u2014 to make a larger point about the things that actually drive American politics.\", \"My Friday column was a related argument about power within the Democratic Party and who is responsible for the party\\u2019s recent (and lackluster) performance.\", \"I was on the \\u201cYou\\u2019re Wrong About\\u201d podcast giving listeners a brief overview of Reconstruction.

If you want a spicier cream sauce, roast two jalape\\u00f1os along with the poblanos (and be sure to remove the seeds). If you want a richer sauce, you can use half-and-half instead of milk.\", \"Ingredients\", \"Directions\", \"Roast the poblanos over an open flame or 4 inches below a broiler, turning regularly until blistered and blackened all over, about 5 minutes for an open flame, 10 minutes for the broiler. Place in a bowl, cover with a kitchen towel and let cool until handleable.\", \"Place the spinach in a microwaveable bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, poke a few holes in the top and microwave on high (100%) until completely wilted, usually about 2 minutes. Uncover and set aside.\", \"Turn your stove to its lowest setting. Heat the oil in a very large (12-inch) skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium. Add the garlic and cook, stirring regularly, until soft and lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, scoop the garlic into a blender. Set the skillet aside.\", \"Rub the blackened skin off the chiles and pull out the stems and seed pods. Rinse the chiles to remove bits of skin and seeds. Roughly chop and add to the blender, along with the masa harina and milk. Blend until smooth.\", \"Return the skillet to medium-high heat. Sprinkle both sides of the fish liberally with salt and pepper. Lay the fillets in the hot oil and cook until richly browned, about 2 to 3 minutes. Use a spatula to flip the fillets, and cook until the fish barely flakes when pressed firmly with a finger or the back of a spoon (you want it slightly underdone), usually a couple of minutes longer for fish that\\u2019s about 1 inch thick. Using the spatula, transfer the fish to an ovenproof plate and set in the oven.\", \"With the skillet still over medium-high heat, pour in the poblano mixture and whisk until it comes to a boil and thickens, about 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes to blend the flavors. If the sauce has thickened past the consistency of a cream soup, whisk in a little more milk. Taste and season with salt, usually a generous \\u00bd teaspoon.\", \"Add the spinach to the sauce and stir until it is warm and well coated with sauce. Divide the creamy spinach among four plates. Top each portion with a piece of seared fish. (Or if it seems more appealing to you, spoon the sauce over the fillets.)\", \"Serve without delay.\"]","href_hash":"2a5e97425a9611ecb2ba5fa19e15f71e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2a5e97425a9611ecb2ba5fa19e15f71e"}},
