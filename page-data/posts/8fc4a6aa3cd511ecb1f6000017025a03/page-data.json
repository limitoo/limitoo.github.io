According to historians, Hastings funded the slaughters of the Yuki people of Mendocino County and helped to orchestrate and finance campaigns that legalized lynchings, kidnappings and slavery against the Indigenous tribe.\", \"The university had been making strides to reckon with its founder's history since 2017. Among these efforts include providing free legal services to the Yuki, honoring the Indigenous lives lost through a campus memorial, and establishing an Indigenous Law Center.\", \"The decision is being praised by former alumni of the university and the Yuki tribe.\", \"\\\"I'm not terribly proud of carrying the Hastings name on my law license.
