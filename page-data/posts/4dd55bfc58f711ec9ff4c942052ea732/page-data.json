But California\\u2019s governor\\u2019s office? How to say this delicately?\", \"\\u201cRinky-dink.\\u201d\", \"That\\u2019s how Arnold Schwarzenegger put it this week as he remembered the grand tour the departing governor, Gray Davis, gave him shortly after Schwarzenegger won the 2003 election in which Davis was recalled.\", \"The cramped quarters. The drab d\\u00e9cor. The way you could walk right past the entrance \\u2014 in a bland, six-story space completed in 1952 \\u2014 and not even know its occupant was the leader of one of the world\\u2019s largest economies.\", \"\\u201cHe showed me the bathroom and I was like, \\u2018How do you have enough room even to pull your pants down?\\u2019\\u201d Schwarzenegger remembered, chomping a cigar and laughing during an interview on FaceTime from his home in Brentwood. \\u201cIt was not at all what California is about. It was embarrassing.\\u201d\", \"From that \\u201cpathetic\\u201d first impression came a plan that, nearly two decades later, is coming to fruition: an overhaul of the midcentury wing of offices known as the Capitol Annex where the governor, the lieutenant governor, all but five legislators and more than 1,000 staff members conduct the people\\u2019s business. Or at least a plan that will bring it into compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act.\", \"Schwarzenegger commissioned a serious study that was waylaid by the Great Recession. His successor, Gov. Jerry Brown, revived the issue and won legislative funding for building upgrades. In 2017, Assemblyman Ken Cooley, a Sacramento-area Democrat who leads the joint legislative committee overseeing such matters, took the reins of what became a $1.2 billion-plus renovation project.\", \"Now, in preparation for work to begin, the occupants of the Capitol Annex have begun moving to temporary quarters. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve taken a page from Elvis and left the building,\\u201d joked H.D. Palmer, a deputy director of the state\\u2019s Department of Finance.\", \"Cooley said the new $450 million state building, a block away, is already an improvement because \\u201cthere aren\\u2019t any doghouses\\u201d \\u2014 every legislative office has a window. A legislative staff member before joining the Assembly, he views the change as a strategic investment in good government.\", \"The renovation, when complete, will not only address the Annex\\u2019s obvious issues \\u2014 leaky plumbing, lack of sprinklers, halls and bathrooms that inadequately accommodate wheelchairs, floors that don\\u2019t match the floors of the 19th-century neo-Classical landmark onto which the Annex is attached. It also will expand office space and create suites big enough for committee chairs and their staffs to be near each other, the better to brainstorm.\", \"\\u201cWe shape our buildings,\\u201d Cooley said, quoting Winston Churchill. \\u201cAnd afterwards, they shape us.\\u201d\", \"It is unclear when the Annex will fall: Several lawsuits are challenging the teardown. Among the objections are that the new project uproots historic trees, lacks alternatives to demolition and fails to consult with historic preservation officials. In a refrain that has vexed California developers for decades, one charges that the remodel violates the California Environmental Quality Act.\", \"The litigation, however, will not stop initial work, such as asbestos removal. \\u201cThose projects will be necessary regardless,\\u201d Cooley said. The aim is to have the new addition ready to open by Sept. 9, 2025, California\\u2019s 175th anniversary of statehood.\", \"Schwarzenegger\\u2019s annoyance with the Annex notwithstanding, he was renowned as a host there during his years in the governor\\u2019s office, which is built around a courtyard and colloquially known as \\u201cThe Horseshoe.\\u201d\", \"He brought a big statue of a grizzly bear back from a gallery in Aspen and installed it outside the governor\\u2019s doorway, where it became a wildly popular attraction for visiting school groups. (So many small hands petted it before it was roped off during the coronavirus pandemic that it became known around the Capitol as \\u201cBacteria Bear\\u201d; it is now outside the new governor\\u2019s digs.) He also established a tent in the courtyard to accommodate cigar smoking. Later, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has four children and many staff members who are young parents, installed a playhouse.\", \"Brown, who is famously spare, did not complain personally about the accommodations, although a 2016 report from his administration called the Annex \\u201caged, inefficient and inadequate.\\u201d But Schwarzenegger would pointedly meet visiting world leaders in Santa Monica in his big personal office, lined with showbiz memorabilia, rather than in Sacramento, where he said the governor\\u2019s suite couldn\\u2019t accommodate entourages.\", \"\\u201cWhen you visit the governor in a great office, there\\u2019s a different respect and you can negotiate,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mostly, however, he said, he felt the existing offices undersold the spirit of California.\", \"\\u201cLittle offices produce little,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou are not surrounded by a grand vision. This state has a history of big visions. We are the powerhouse of the United States.\\u201d\", \"For more:\", \"A father and son were arrested on suspicion of starting the Caldor fire.\", \"This treat sandwiches raspberry jam between two buttery cookie layers.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes from Lisa von Schlegell:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.
