This time, restrictions came within hours of South Africa\\u2019s announcement \\u2014 and hours before health officials from the country were scheduled to discuss the variant with the World Health Organization.\", \"Britain and Israel announced bans on flights from South Africa and several neighboring countries on Thursday, citing the threat of the new variant. Britain\\u2019s flight ban applies to six countries \\u2014 South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe \\u2014 and begins at noon local time on Friday.\", \"\\u201cMore data is needed but we\\u2019re taking precautions now,\\u201d Sajid Javid, the British health secretary, said on Twitter.\", \"The governments of Italy, Malta and Singapore announced on Friday that they would impose similar restrictions. Markets were down in Japan in response to the variant\\u2019s discovery, and officials in Australia and in New Zealand said that they were monitoring it closely.\", \"\\u201cOur scientists are at work to study the new B.1.1.529 variant,\\u201d Italy\\u2019s health minister, Roberto Speranza, said in a statement, using the variant\\u2019s scientific name. \\u201cMeanwhile we err on the side of caution.\\u201d\", \"Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union\\u2019s executive arm, also said in a Twitter post on Friday morning that it would propose restricting air travel to European countries from southern Africa because of concerns about the variant.\", \"In the past two days, scientists detected the variant after observing an increase in infections in South Africa\\u2019s economic hub surrounding Johannesburg. So far only a few dozen cases have been identified in South Africa, Hong Kong, Israel and Botswana.\", \"A number of variants have emerged since the onset of the pandemic. One underlying concern about them is whether they will stymie the fight against the virus or limit the effectiveness of vaccines. South African scientists will meet with the World Health Organization technical team on Friday to discuss the new variant, and the authorities will assign it a letter of the Greek alphabet.\", \"In a statement posted on Friday on a government website, South Africa said it would urge Britain to reconsider its travel restrictions, saying: \\u201cThe U.K.\\u2019s decision to temporarily ban South Africans from entering the U.K. seems to have been rushed, as even the World Health Organization is yet to advise on the next steps.\\u201d\", \"In December last year, South Africa was the first nation to report the appearance of the Beta variant, which has now spread to nearly 70 countries. Scientists have been concerned that some clinical trials have shown that vaccines offer less protection against the Beta variant. Since then, the more virulent and aggressive Delta variant has spread all over the world and is believed to be fueling the latest surge in cases.\", \"With over 1,200 new infections, South Africa\\u2019s daily infection rate is much lower than that in Germany, where new cases are driving a wave. However, the density of mutations on this new variant raises fears that it could be highly contagious, leading scientists to sound the alarm early.\", \"\\u201cThis variant did surprise us \\u2014 it has a big jump in evolution, many more mutations than we expected, especially after a very severe third wave of Delta,\\u201d said Tulio de Oliveira, director of the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation Sequencing Platform.\", \"\"]","href_hash":"f6d3f9804e9c11ecb908159b9901b740"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f6d3f9804e9c11ecb908159b9901b740"}},
