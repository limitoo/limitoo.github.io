She underwent a CT scan, but doctors were \\u201cunable to determine if her nose was fractured because of the swelling,\\u201d the filing said.\", \"According to statements that passengers who witnessed the episode made to the F.B.I. agent, the flight attendant asked Mr. Hsu to stay away from the bathroom, and Mr. Hsu \\u201cpunched her in the face with sufficient force to cause her to hit the lavatory door.\\u201d Another witness described the passenger \\u201cstriking her with his fist in a way that appeared practiced or trained.\\u201d\", \"After the flight attendant was struck, another flight attendant repeatedly asked Mr. Hsu to sit in his seat, according to the filing.
