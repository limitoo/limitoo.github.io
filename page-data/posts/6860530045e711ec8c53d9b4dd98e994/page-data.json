case rarely seen in Queensland.\", \"The journalist, known only as F, had argued in the Court of Appeal that he should be protected from revealing a source under a public interest immunity, but it was dismissed.\", \"In 2018, the journalist received a tip-off from a police officer about an impending raid on the home of a murder suspect, who was also the subject of a joint counter-terrorism investigation.\", \"The journalist dispatched a reporter and camera operator to the address, and they managed to catch the arrest on camera.\", \"The leak of information was considered a serious breach by the authorities, and Queensland's Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) launched an investigation into how it was obtained by the media.\", \"The journalist refused to reveal the police source to the CCC and appealed against a directive to expose the informant, citing his ethical obligation to protect sources' identities.\", \"The journalist argued in the Court of Appeal that he should not have to reveal his confidential source, citing a public interest immunity.\", \"But the court found there was no protection under the law for the journalist's\\u00a0confidential source, and that public interest immunity could not be applied to the case.\", \"The ruling allows the CCC to compel the journalist to reveal their source\\u00a0or face criminal charges, including up to five years in jail.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Jailed for doing their job'</div>\", \"Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance spokeswoman Michelle Rae said journalists relied on information from confidential sources\\u00a0to hold those in power to account.\", \"\\\"Effectively what it means in Queensland\\u00a0is that journalists can be jailed for doing their job \\u2014 this is about the community's right to know,\\\" Ms Rae said.\", \"\\\"If we think back in our history \\u2014 the Fitzgerald Inquiry \\u2014 that was journalists talking to workers who came forward and said: 'This is happening and I don't think it's right'.\", \"Lawyers for journalist F are still considering the decision and whether they will seek leave to appeal in the High Court\\u00a0to fight the ruling.\",

jurisdiction in Australia that does not have shield laws to protect journalists from having to reveal their sources.\", \"The state government will introduce a bill into parliament this week to introduce shield laws.\", \"But Queensland Attorney-General Shannon Fentiman said the laws would initially only apply to court proceedings \\u2014 not orders by the CCC.\", \"It means the laws would not protect journalist F, should the CCC continue to pursue the journalist to reveal his source.\", \"Ms Fentiman said there might be changes to include CCC powers in the future.\", \"\\\"Most other jurisdictions, their shield laws do not apply to corruption proceedings, but we will be doing that work to make sure that Queenslanders and journalists are protected,\\\" Ms Fentiman said.\", \"\\\"I think people will be really pleased with the work that we've done.\", \"\\\"They will strong shield laws that protect Queenslanders, and we'll do the work next year to look at how we can expand those
