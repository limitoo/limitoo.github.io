They remain at the heart of our continued mahi to create the memorial.\\\"\", \"Cavanagh said her thoughts were with those who took part in the recovery operation in Antarctica as part of Operation Overdue, in particular the former colleagues, friends, and wh\\u0101nau of retired inspector Greg Gilpin, who passed away recently.\", \"\\\"Greg was a strong supporter of the memorial project. I know his passing has been felt keenly by many of those involved in Operation Overdue and by a number of Erebus families, who he met and supported in the years following.\\\"\", \"She said she remained confident in the integrity of the processes around the memorial.\", \"\\\"The environmental, cultural and heritage values of the park will be properly respected and protected.\", \"\\\"The notable p\\u014dhutukawa tree will not be harmed by the establishment of the memorial. It is safe, and will continue to be kept safe, throughout the construction of the memorial and beyond.\", \"\\\"Independent arborists have reviewed the plans and have concluded the memorial poses no risk to the tree.\", \"\\\"On cultural matters we continue to be guided by Ng\\u0101ti Wh\\u0101tua \\u014cr\\u0101kei Trust, whose rohe the memorial site is within.
