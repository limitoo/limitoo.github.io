It's understood around 150 residents will be removed from the two archipelagos.\", \"\\\"We are aware there is significant damage to the outer islands. Two of those islands will undergo an evacuation of the numbers that are there and our Navy vessels may well be in a position to help with that effort,\\\" Mahuta told reporters.\", \"\\\"If the request is made, because Tonga has sent their Navy vessel up there, it will be to help physically remove the families and then move them to another island.\\\"\", \"Mahuta confirmed that two Navy vessels - HMNZS Wellington and HMNZS Aotearoa - were deployed to the Kingdom on Tuesday, carrying personnel, equipment and supplies, to assist with the nation's recovery. Among the personnel on-board are diving teams to assess the changes to the seabed in the shipping channels and ports. They will also be able to assess damage to wharf infrastructure to assure the future delivery of aid and support from the sea.\\u00a0\", \"Also on-board the vessels are bulk water supplies, humanitarian and disaster relief stores and a Seasprite helicopter.\\u00a0\", \"Teams will be delivering the support in a contactless way, she confirmed. The journey is expected to take three days.\", \"Meanwhile, a C-130 Hercules aircraft is on standby to deliver humanitarian aid and disaster relief stores, including collapsible water containers, generators and hygiene kits for families once the airport runway is cleared.\\u00a0\", \"Mahuta said that initial assessments have confirmed there is no significant damage to the runway at Fua'amotu International Airport, however volunteers are still working to clear the ashfall from Saturday's eruption. It may be completed before the end of the week, she said, which will allow aircraft to land safely once a full assessment has been taken.\", \"Supplying fresh water is a key objective, she said, as drinking water has largely been contaminated by the volcanic debris. New Zealand personnel will be assisting with desalination efforts.\\u00a0\", \"Mahuta confirmed there have been no further updates on fatalities - to date, two Tongan nationals and one foreign national - British woman Angela Glover - have been confirm dead.\\u00a0\", \"Other deployments are possible in the next few days, subject to Tongan Government requests and permissions and COVID-19 border rules.\", \"The Government has allocated a further $500,000 in humanitarian assistance, taking the initial funding to $1 million.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"5b703bdc78d311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5b703bdc78d311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
