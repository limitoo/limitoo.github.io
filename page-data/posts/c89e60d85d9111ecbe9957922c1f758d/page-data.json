The social scientist Pauline Boss sees it differently.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-15T10:30:11.000Z","content":"[\"When I first visited Pauline Boss in late May, Minneapolis was on the cusp of fully reopening. Boss, who is 87, greeted me in her building\\u2019s lobby wearing thick-framed glasses, her light blonde hair short and an Apple Watch clasped on her left wrist. She cautiously extended a hand toward me. \\u201cCan we shake hands?\\u201d she asked, smiling. \\u201cDare we?\\u201d We did.\", \"The apartment was bright, with two walls of windows pouring sky into the space. Bookshelves were filled with works of sociology, psychology and history; a section was devoted primarily to Sigmund Freud, and another to Boss\\u2019s hometown, New Glarus, Wis. Out the window, the Mississippi River churned under bridges, past the tangle of downtown.\", \"The view, however spectacular, was not the apartment\\u2019s selling point. The elevators were. Boss, an emeritus professor of family social science \\u2014 the study of families and close relationships \\u2014 chose the place seven years ago because her husband\\u2019s declining health had made it difficult for him to climb the stairs of their house near the University of Minnesota, where she taught. His decline was gradual. In 2000, he was using a cane; by last year, when he was 88, rheumatoid arthritis had rendered him unable to walk. Vascular issues resulted in open wounds on his legs.\", \"Despite his illness, the couple maintained a semblance of normalcy, entertaining guests, going for drives and attending the theater, until last year, when the pandemic isolated them in the apartment. Then, their only visitors were home health aides; once they left, Boss would take care of her husband, changing the dressing on his bandages and administering his medications.\", \"\\u201cIt sneaks up on you,\\u201d Boss said of the burden of caregiving and its attendant emotional struggles. She felt a range of contradictory feelings: gratitude for their time together, grief over the loss of their old rhythms and anxiety at the inevitability of his death. Boss was also confused about her role in their partnership. Once solely his wife, she was now also his caregiver.\", \"With her husband\\u2019s drawn-out illness, Boss\\u2019s life came to resemble the cases she\\u2019d spent her career studying. Nearly 50 years ago, as a doctoral student in child development and family studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, she researched families with at least one member who was either physically or psychologically absent. Her initial studies in the 1970s focused on families in which fathers were too busy working to spend time with their children, and later on the wives of fighter pilots who were missing in action during the Vietnam War. The fathers were psychologically absent but physically present, while the fighter pilots were the reverse. Each situation created a sensation of limbo for family members, a lingering sense of grief over losses whose nature was uncertain.\", \"Sometimes, as in the case of a death accompanied by a body and a certificate, the scope of loss is relatively clear. But in the cases Boss studied, losses lacked such authoritative certainty. There were often no bodies, and thus no rituals for mourning. Rather than being tied to a specific event, these losses frequently extended over many years, deepening each day in ways that grievers could not register. Could such experiences even be considered losses? Boss, observing how families spoke about their missing relatives, coined a term to define the unclear \\u2014 and often unacknowledged \\u2014 absences in their lives: \\u201cambiguous loss.\\u201d\", \"Over the next several decades, Boss studied and provided therapy to the family members of Alzheimer\\u2019s patients, as well as the relatives of people whose bodies were never recovered after natural disasters, or in the collapse of the original World Trade Center on 9/11. Theirs were losses without \\u201cconclusion,\\u201d in the traditional sense of the term, an experience of paradox \\u2014 a simultaneous absence and presence \\u2014 that eluded resolution. Can you mourn someone whose body is present, even if the mind isn\\u2019t? Or whose death is unconfirmed? Can you grieve a foreclosed future? \", \"The concept, Boss maintains, is inclusive, encompassing a range of moderate to severe losses that we might not perceive as such. It can take many forms, often quotidian: an alcoholic parent who, when inebriated, becomes a different person; a divorced partner, with whom your relationship is ruptured but not erased; a loved one with whom you\\u2019ve lost contact through immigration; or a child you\\u2019ve given up for adoption. These experiences are an accumulation of heartbreaks that we cannot always recognize.\", \"Freudian notions of grieving have taught us that mourning is a process leading to detachment \\u2014 a sort of closure. Boss finds this model misleading, perilously bound up in the way Americans conceptualize themselves. In a new book published this month, \\u201cThe Myth of Closure: Ambiguous Loss in a Time of Pandemic and Change,\\u201d she writes that the United States is a place that privileges narratives of self-sufficiency and rationality. Elisabeth K\\u00fcbler-Ross\\u2019s linear \\u201cfive stages of grief\\u201d model \\u2014 which implies that if we work hard enough and follow certain steps, we\\u2019ll be able to get over our losses within a reasonable timeline \\u2014 remains a popular mode of thinking. But Boss argues that many losses do not follow such models, and our reliance on them does not equip us to cope.\", \"By contrast, ambiguous loss gives us a term with which to acknowledge the amorphous nature of its emotional wounding. People are able to identify with this type of loss when they have language for it. \\u201cWhenever you bring it up to somebody,\\u201d Boss told me, \\u201cthey go almost within five minutes to one of their own.\\u201d\", \"Perhaps this is why Boss\\u2019s work has had a resurgence of interest among researchers and journalists during the past two years, in the wake of the pandemic, George Floyd\\u2019s murder and the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. In a time when the global community is grappling with questions of atmospheric grief, she has broadened her attention beyond the family, looking \\u2014 along with her acolytes \\u2014 out to questions of societal bereavement. \", \"This influence isn\\u2019t sudden. After the 1999 publication of Boss\\u2019s seminal book, \\u201cAmbiguous Loss: Learning to Live With Unresolved Grief,\\u201d numerous scholars began building on her work. They published papers examining exile, foster care and traumatic brain injury through the lens of her theory. Today, younger researchers have inquired whether urgent social and political issues \\u2014 the loss of the world as we know it as a result of climate change, or the stifling sorrow of suffering consistent racial violence \\u2014 can be understood within her theory. This reflects ambiguous loss\\u2019s growing influence and breadth as a tool to understand why, and how, we grieve. \", \"Boss takes pleasure in mentoring younger scholars and seeing them apply the theory in innovative and often surprising ways. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like a bouquet of roses to me,\\u201d she said. \\u201cFor me, if the theory is useful, I feel good about that.\\u201d\", \"Inspired in part by the queries, \\u201cThe Myth of Closure\\u201d takes a sweeping look at racial unrest and the pandemic while refuting the idea that grief has a prescribed endpoint. In some regards, the book is a testament to the ways in which these researchers have pushed her thought in new directions, particularly on race. \\u201cNow, after much thinking since that fateful Memorial Day when George Floyd was killed, here in my hometown of Minneapolis, combined with the questions coming to me from around the world, I have expanded my ideas about ambiguous loss,\\u201d she writes. \\u201cIt can happen to one person, one family, a local community or the global community.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe Myth of Closure\\u201d is also her attempt to make sense of simultaneously unfolding catastrophes in her personal life and around the world. \\u201cThis is the first time I\\u2019ve raised ambiguous loss to a higher level regarding the pandemic, a societal level,\\u201d Boss told me. In trying to describe losses that society doesn\\u2019t always recognize, Boss might be helping us to rethink the nature of loss altogether.\", \"Boss emanates the wisdom of a lifetime spent focused on an idea. Her manner is thoughtful and serene. During our conversation, she chose her words carefully, gazing out the window while searching for the best possible formulation. Her work can be grim in nature, but she is quick to laugh and delights in small pleasures \\u2014 on her birthday, she was content to go for vanilla ice cream with chocolate chips. Though her oeuvre is vast \\u2014 eight books, more than a hundred peer-reviewed articles and chapters, thousands of citations spanning some 44 years \\u2014 she responded to my questions by drawing from a well-kept archive, recounting decades-old anecdotes and arguments with ease.\", \"The daughter of a tenant farmer and a homemaker, Boss grew up in New Glarus, a Wisconsin village populated mostly by Swiss immigrants, including her father. He came to the United States during the 1920s to study agriculture, intending to return to Switzerland to marry. Then the Great Depression hit. He was stuck.\", \"Eventually, Boss\\u2019s father married and started a family in America, working with dairy cows and growing crops. He missed his home, but he wasn\\u2019t sure that he could ever return. Boss noticed he sometimes became distant, especially when letters arrived from Switzerland. \\u201cHomesickness became a central part of my family\\u2019s culture,\\u201d Boss wrote in her 1999 book. \\u201cLonging for faraway family members was so common that at an early age I became curious about this unnamed loss and the melancholy that never went away. It was all around me.\\u201d\", \"In 1952, Boss started college in Madison. At the time, it was rare for a girl from her village to study beyond high school. Most married upon graduation, and Boss herself married as a 19-year-old college student. Yet she was eager to learn about a world beyond the farmland of southern Wisconsin, where going out on the weekend meant a Friday-night fish fry and dancing the polka.\", \"After college, she studied for a master\\u2019s degree in child development and family studies, writing her thesis on the cultural roles across three generations of Swiss American and Amish women in her hometown. Excited by this \\u201ckitchen table research,\\u201d in which anecdotal information gleaned from hours of conversation became the data, Boss embarked on an academic career that existed at the edge of disciplines, in the relatively unknown field of family social science.\", \"As a doctoral student in the early 1970s, she developed the theory for which she is best known. Invited to observe a psychiatrist\\u2019s sessions at the university\\u2019s family-therapy clinic, she \\u201cnoticed that the fathers were always angry about being there. And they said, \\u2018The children are mothers\\u2019 business. Why am I here?\\u2019\\u201d Boss told me. The fathers, many of whom worked corporate jobs, were too preoccupied to help raise their children. She termed the phenomenon \\u201cpsychological father absence in intact families,\\u201d but a professor who taught her theory-development course pushed her to think bigger. In retrospect, Boss says, she could have spent the next decade writing solely about fathers. Instead, following her professor\\u2019s advice, she landed on a broader research concept: ambiguous loss.\", \"Her father\\u2019s estrangement from his European family, and his emotional absence from his American one, were the germs of Boss\\u2019s theory. She now knows that her father was experiencing ongoing grief in which no death had occurred; while she realized then that what she felt was the ambiguity, the loss was vague. Theorizing a category of loss would help Boss, fellow academics and laypeople make sense of griefs whose origins and parameters were equally unclear.\", \"Over the next 45 years, as a researcher and therapist, Boss worked with thousands of families who struggled with similar dynamics. Often she was called to provide emergency therapy for people whose relatives were missing following a disaster. Meanwhile, she was coping with her own personal tragedies \\u2014 the deaths of both of her parents, and her sister.\", \"Boss found that ambiguous loss can result in what she termed \\u201cfrozen grief,\\u201d when people are stuck in their sorrow; or \\u201cdisenfranchised grief,\\u201d a term coined by the mental-health counselor Kenneth J. Doka to describe when others do not see a significant loss as legitimate or deserving of support. To that end, her work diverges from historical grief research, which has considered sorrow something to overcome. Freud\\u2019s \\u201cMourning and Melancholia,\\u201d first published in 1917, promoted detachment from the deceased as a healthy grief response, and therapists following this model counseled their clients to let go of whomever they had lost. Such training focused on helping clients seek \\u201cclosure,\\u201d an endpoint to grief.\", \"Rejecting linear models, Boss offers six nonsequential guidelines meant to help people bear their grief: making meaning out of loss; relinquishing one\\u2019s desire to control an uncontrollable situation; recreating identity after loss; becoming accustomed to ambivalent feelings; redefining one\\u2019s relationship with whatever or whomever they\\u2019ve lost; and finding new hope. Two of the guidelines, \\u201cmeaning\\u201d and \\u201cnew hope,\\u201d are especially important for coping, intended to help people consider what the loss signifies in their lives and how they can imagine a future that contains their loss.\", \"Boss draws from the work of thinkers who challenge presumptions of linearity in the grief process and provide language that breaks free from the confines of Freud\\u2019s formal writings. She finds inspiration in the writings of Viktor Frankl, an Austrian psychotherapist and concentration-camp survivor, who wrote of searching for meaning in loss, and the psychologist Dennis Klass, whose theory of \\u201ccontinuing bonds\\u201d offers a paradigm of bereavement in which mourners maintain a relationship \\u2014 if only psychological \\u2014 with the deceased. \\u201cWhile simplistic declarations of closure are comforting for bystanders, they are hurtful for the bereaved,\\u201d Boss writes. \\u201cIf we have loved, we will want to remember.\\u201d\", \"I first encountered Boss\\u2019s ideas in July 2020. My grandfather had just died of Covid-19, which he contracted at his care facility near Dallas. My mother, brother and I had driven halfway across the country to say goodbye to him through a closed window. Because he had Alzheimer\\u2019s, I had spent years trying to say goodbye, but this final time was abrupt, ragged like a wound reopened. We told him we loved him, and he struggled for air. After two days of this, he died in the night.\", \"One afternoon about a week later, while waiting to pick up his ashes, I heard Boss on a 2016 episode of the podcast \\u201cOn Being.\\u201d Her voice, clear yet gentle, cut through the air-conditioner\\u2019s thrum as she spoke with Krista Tippett, the show\\u2019s host. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not comfortable with unanswered questions,\\u201d Boss said. \\u201cThese are losses that are minus facts.\\u201d I wasn\\u2019t alone. During the pandemic, Tippett noticed that people were posting on social media about that interview. \\u201cPeople were saying, \\u2018I\\u2019m listening to this again, it\\u2019s really helping me,\\u2019\\u201d Tippett said. She decided to invite Boss back onto the show to discuss how her theory might apply to the pandemic. They talked about \\u201closses not just of life but of livelihood, of possibility, of dreams, of plans, of things that seemed certain yesterday,\\u201d Tippett told me.\", \"Boss had given me a theory for my own life \\u2014 and language to describe the prolonged nature of my loss. For nearly a decade, my grandfather had succumbed to Alzheimer\\u2019s, until he could no longer remember my name or face. At the end of his life, we lived far apart, and that distance made it difficult to see him, a reality that now haunted me. There was a temporal lag in my experience of loss; though he was now irrefutably gone, I\\u2019d been losing my grandfather for years. His death dredged up old feelings of guilt and regret. I mourned the time we never spent together, the questions I never asked. Ambiguous loss seemed to explain this long, unsettled grief.\", \"\\u201cThe Myth of Closure\\u201d describes the complicated experience of mourning during the pandemic. \\u201cTo all of you who are grieving someone or something you loved and lost during this pandemic, may I say this?\\u201d Boss writes. \\u201cIt is not closure you need but certainty that your loved one is gone, that they understood why you could not be there to comfort them, that they loved you and forgave you in their last moments of life. Without these things, some doubts may linger for you, but that is the nature of loss. Its ending is never perfect, even in the best of times.\\u201d\", \"Boss intends for the book, a relatively slim text comprising nine chapters, to be therapeutic. It\\u2019s a hybrid work: a self-help book providing strategies for coping with ambiguous loss, but also a document of observations from 40-plus years researching and counseling families, and a personal meditation on love and loss. While her old arguments \\u2014 against binary thinking; in favor of accepting paradox \\u2014 are the foundation, the book is also a response to overwhelming global catastrophes of late. \\u201cThis worldwide health crisis brought many ambiguous losses,\\u201d she writes. \\u201cLoved ones died alone in hospitals with no family allowed, all losing the comfort of a last goodbye; students lost rituals of graduation and saying goodbye to classmates, as well as the chance to meet new friends at the beginning of a new academic year; younger children were schooled at home, many alone in their rooms in front of a computer; others struggled because they had no broadband, computer or internet access. The critical experiences that traditionally marked growing up were lost \\u2014 a surreal experience for the young as well as their parents.\\u201d\", \"Outlining why these losses are ambiguous, Boss considers the theory\\u2019s two original categories: \\u201cphysical\\u201d and \\u201cpsychological.\\u201d \\u201cThe first is physical \\u2014 no body to bury, no proof of death. We see this now with Covid-19 deaths, where families are not allowed to view the body or have the usual funeral rituals of mourning and burial,\\u201d she writes, describing the pandemic\\u2019s early days. Psychological absences can also include obsessions or preoccupations, she continues, noting that many people have been \\u201cpreoccupied with worry and anxiety about the virus.\\u201d Social distancing was also an ambiguous loss, she argues; unable to visit loved ones, we were psychologically present but physically absent.\", \"The theory is \\u201cnot as narrow as it was in the inception\\u201d \\u2014 a positive development, Boss told me, because more people can find the concept meaningful in their own lives. Researchers have expanded the original two categories to include applications beyond the family. \\u201cThe theory of ambiguous loss has left my desk long ago,\\u201d she said.\", \"While Boss cautions that \\u201cambiguous loss can\\u2019t be a theory of everything,\\u201d she also acknowledges that ambiguity is difficult to measure. \\u201cIt is perceptual, in the person\\u2019s mind,\\u201d she told me, making its study particularly personal. Social scientists like herself assess whether something may be considered an ambiguous loss based on qualitative interviews, plus some quantitative data. How interviewees describe their loss is a key indicator of whether it is ambiguous. Boss gives examples of such language in her work: \\u201cAm I married or not since my husband has been missing for decades?\\u201d \\u201cHow do I answer how many children I have when I gave one up for adoption?\\u201d\", \"When asked to define the theory, Boss simply says it is \\u201can unclear loss that can be physical or psychological and it has no resolution.\\u201d Undergirding the idea are core assumptions that speak to its subjectivity, the first of which states that \\u201ca phenomenon can exist even if it cannot be measured.\\u201d In other words, the loss\\u2019s immeasurability doesn\\u2019t negate its existence \\u2014 or its crippling effects. Second, she assumes that, when it comes to ambiguous loss, there is no single narrative that can explain a deprivation; subjectivity colors our perception of loss. The goal of social scientists and therapists should be to determine how people can live well despite not knowing or understanding the scope of their loss. Third, ambiguous loss is a relational phenomenon, based on attachment.\", \"That ambiguous loss is so broad may be frustrating to those who crave absolute parameters. But its haziness is the point. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a theory about imprecision, and how do those of us who like precision live with such ambiguity,\\u201d Boss told me. If ambiguous loss seems to encompass an impossibly large field, it is because the researchers and writers following after Boss see its potential to reshape society\\u2019s expectations for grief.\", \"Last year, Boss received a flood of public and scholarly inquiries about one particular application of the theory: racism as ambiguous loss. In May 2020, George Floyd was murdered, just a few miles south of Boss\\u2019s apartment. Younger scholars had already begun using her framework to research the extreme stresses of racism, and now, following their lead, Boss turned her attention to a loss pervasive in her own city.\", \"In \\u201cThe Myth of Closure,\\u201d Boss contributes to the already robust study of slavery\\u2019s traumatic aftermath. She suggests that losses from slavery \\u2014 the experience of being wrenched from home and family, of losing control over one\\u2019s own body \\u2014 were ambiguous. These relationship ruptures, which to me recall the sociologist Orlando Patterson\\u2019s theory that enslavement caused \\u201csocial death,\\u201d produced a generational transmission of trauma, \\u201cremembered today in the bodies and minds of their descendants,\\u201d and omnipresent in the systems that continue to oppress Black people today. Boss draws from scholarship in family therapy, sociology and social work, particularly the work of Elaine Pinderhughes, who, she writes, \\u201cwas one of the first to teach me that historical context matters for human development and that being traumatized instead of nurtured will affect not only children, but also their own offspring as well.\\u201d\", \"The harrowing video of George Floyd\\u2019s murder catalyzed an intense outpouring of grief and anger, a manifestation of omnipresent racial trauma. That continual trauma, Boss suggests, is where ambiguous loss lies. Scholars have long studied racism as a source of stress and grief \\u2014 in the 1970s, the psychiatrist Chester Pierce wrote about the stressful \\u201cmundane extreme environment\\u201d in which Black Americans live \\u2014 but now family scientists are finding new resonance in Boss\\u2019s work to explain how racism can produce ambiguous losses in Black families and communities. \", \"One scholar applying the framework is Chalandra Bryant, a professor of family social science at the University of Minnesota. While researching marriage in Black Southern families in the mid-2000s, Bryant met a woman who confided that her husband was acting unusually withdrawn. Although he was still functioning \\u2014 going to work, picking up his child from school \\u2014 he was emotionally vacant. Bryant learned that news reports about racist incidents and his child\\u2019s experiences in school had deeply affected him. \\u201cIt turns out that he was depressed and apprehensive and he couldn\\u2019t quite put his finger on why,\\u201d Bryant said. He felt \\u201che had no control over making sure that his family felt safe.\\u201d\", \"Bryant sees Boss\\u2019s theory as important to understanding the effects of stressors. Racism, she says, is a stressor impacting the lives of Black Americans. \\u201cThat could leave a culture wondering, Where do I fit here? Who are we as a culture that so many people can feel such hatred toward us?\\u201d Bryant, who is Black, said, \\u201cI think that can make people wonder or think about where they fit in society.\\u201d\", \"Today Bryant is working with a team on a project that examines financial strain on Black families through the lens of Boss\\u2019s theory. Racist housing policies historically prevented Black Minneapolis residents from accumulating wealth; today only 25 percent own homes in the metropolitan area, compared with 77 percent of white residents \\u2014 the largest homeownership gap of any major American city. Financial stress, Bryant says, can contribute to people losing their sense of self, often without understanding why. In this way, the nebulous effects of anti-Black racism permeate the psyche.\", \"In mid-July, I returned to Minneapolis and asked Boss to accompany me to the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, known as George Floyd Square. In May, the intersection was closed to traffic, inviting mourning, meditation and protest. Now I saw that the offerings and gardens previously occupying the space were moved to make room for cars. A silhouette of Floyd, facedown with wings sprouting from his shoulders \\u2014 marking the spot where the police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck \\u2014 was now surrounded by concrete barriers to protect against traffic.\", \"We ran into a man named Jay Webb, a volunteer gardener. He cried out when he learned Boss\\u2019s name. \\u201cYour line of thinking has helped me,\\u201d he said excitedly, rushing to grab his phone for a selfie. Webb said he encourages visitors to accept their grief and search for peace, sentiments that echoed Boss\\u2019s thought. It was clear her work had expanded into the public sphere, moving people in her own city. Webb told Boss, \\u201cYou are so, so needed here.\\u201d\", \"The theory of ambiguous loss originated in the families and communities she studied and counseled decades ago, and encounters with everyday people like Webb continue to shape her thinking. Boss, who considers herself a lifelong student, learns from these people. \\u201cI need to keep my eyes open,\\u201d Boss told me after we visited George Floyd Square. She recognizes the limits of her knowledge, and expresses gratitude for people who, even in the twilight of her career, have pushed those limits. With \\u201cThe Myth of Closure,\\u201d Boss is learning in public. The resulting book emerged from reflection during the first months of the pandemic, as a response to \\u201cwhat was happening around me at the time,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI realized that, not only was I changing, but that the people who were writing to me were writing about different things,\\u201d she told me, which \\u201cstimulated my own rethinking, new thinking.\\u201d\", \"And though she is an expert on loss, Boss is herself learning how to grieve. In the summer of 2020, her husband\\u2019s health took a turn for the worse. First, he was hospitalized. Then, a few weeks later, he was transferred to a rehabilitation facility. One evening, Boss noticed her husband couldn\\u2019t pick up his spoon, so she fed him instead. But he seemed his normal, genial self, and a nurse said he was improving. Boss left for the evening; he blew her a kiss goodbye. At 10 that night, a doctor called. Her husband was unresponsive. Boss and her daughter rushed to the facility, and there they learned he\\u2019d had a stroke. The staff brought them chairs to rest, but they couldn\\u2019t sleep. In the morning, Boss\\u2019s daughter left to take a shower at home, and when she returned suggested that her mother do the same.\", \"Boss, however, said she would stay. \\u201cEverybody in my life \\u2014 my father, my mother, my sister, my brother \\u2014 died when I turned my back and left,\\u201d Boss told me, her voice wavering. A heaviness settled over our conversation. \\u201cAnd I said, \\u2018I\\u2019m not leaving.\\u2019 And then I looked at him and within about five minutes he took his last breath.\\u201d\", \"\"]","href_hash":"c89e60d85d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c89e60d85d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}},
