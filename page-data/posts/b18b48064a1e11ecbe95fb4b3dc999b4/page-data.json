Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin of Virginia was swarmed with well wishers and favor seekers who believed his victory in a liberal-leaning state offered the party a road map for next year\\u2019s midterm elections.\", \"Out of earshot of the reporters and donors congregating amid the palm trees and cactuses of the Arizona Biltmore resort, however, a more sober, less triumphant and all-too-familiar conversation was taking place among the governors: What could be done about Donald J. Trump?\", \"In a private meeting of the Republican Governors Association\\u2019s executive committee, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland brought up Mr. Trump\\u2019s campaign of retribution against incumbent Republicans he dislikes \\u2014 an effort that appears to be escalating, as the former president pushes former Senator David Perdue of Georgia to challenge Gov. Brian Kemp.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s outrageous, unacceptable and bad for the party,\\u201d Mr. Hogan said in an interview about the former president\\u2019s intervention, which he termed \\u201cTrump cancel culture.\\u201d And it\\u2019s happening, he added, \\u201cwith House members, governors and senators.\\u201d\", \"Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, chairman of the association, assured his fellow governors that the R.G.A. would support Republican incumbents, according to several governors in the room.\", \"One year after his defeat, Mr. Trump is not only still looming over the G.O.P., but also \\u2014 along with his imitators \\u2014 posing the biggest threat to what is shaping up to be a fruitful year for Republican candidates. With President Biden\\u2019s approval ratings mired below 50 percent \\u2014 in some surveys, below 40 percent \\u2014 and voters in a sour mood, Republicans are well positioned to make gains in Congress and statehouses across the country.\", \"But there is Mr. Trump, threatening primary challenges to some House Republicans in key swing districts, endorsing Senate candidates who make party leaders uneasy and recruiting loyalists to take out Republican governors from Idaho to Georgia.\", \"Mr. Youngkin\\u2019s success in a campaign in which his Democratic opponent relentlessly linked him to Mr. Trump has emboldened the former president to further tighten his grip on the party, one whose base remains deeply loyal to him.\", \"Moving beyond the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him this year, Mr. Trump is now threatening to unseat lawmakers who voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill. He taunts Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell as an \\u201cold crow\\u201d on a near-daily basis, while demanding that Mr. McConnell be removed from his leadership post. And, most alarming to the clubby cadre of Republican governors, Mr. Trump has already endorsed two challengers against incumbent governors and is threatening to unseat others.\", \"\\u201cSaving America starts by saving the G.O.P. from RINOs, sellouts and known losers!\\u201d Mr. Trump said last week, using the acronym for \\u201cRepublicans in name only.\\u201d\", \"As Mr. Trump weighs a 2024 comeback, he is plainly determined to ensure that the party he could return to remains every bit as loyal to him as it was when he held office.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s very foreign to the conduct that we\\u2019re used to,\\u201d said Haley Barbour, the former Mississippi governor, who has worked with every Republican president and former president since Richard M. Nixon. Mr. Trump\\u2019s post-presidential predecessors, he said, \\u201cwere scrupulous about not getting involved in primaries.\\u201d\", \"Representative Tom Emmer, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, accused the news media and Democrats of focusing too much on Mr. Trump. Yet it was House Republicans, led by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who invited the former president to headline the committee\\u2019s signature fall fund-raiser this month.\", \"Of the Republican incumbents Mr. Trump is targeting, Mr. Emmer said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re talking about people that have run tough races and been very successful.\\u201d\", \"Beyond targeting lawmakers he feels have not proved sufficiently faithful, Mr. Trump has also normalized aberrant behavior in Republican ranks and fostered a culture of fear among party officials who want to move on from his presidency or at least police their own members. After just two House Republicans voted to censure Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona for posting an animated video that depicted him killing a Democratic lawmaker, for example, Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Gosar\\u2019s re-election, affirming his status as a Republican in good standing.\", \"It is the former president\\u2019s insistence on playing a haphazard kingmaker, however, that is most troubling to Republican officials and strategists. In Pennsylvania, where the party is perhaps most at risk of losing a Senate seat, Mr. Trump endorsed Sean Parnell, a military veteran who has been accused by his ex-wife of spousal and child abuse.\", \"More broadly, Mr. Trump is complicating Mr. McConnell\\u2019s recruitment campaign by making clear his contempt for the sort of center-right Republicans who refuse to echo his lies about last year\\u2019s election. Two New England governors, Chris Sununu of New Hampshire and Phil Scott of Vermont, indicated this month that they would not run for the Senate, Mr. Hogan appears more intent on pursuing a long-shot presidential campaign, and Mr. Ducey continues to insist that he will not challenge first-term Senator Mark Kelly.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not running for the United States Senate, and I\\u2019m 100 percent focused on this final year as Arizona\\u2019s governor,\\u201d Mr. Ducey said in Phoenix, while voicing his respect for Mr. McConnell, who is wooing him with the ardor and attentiveness of a college football coach pursuing a five-star high school quarterback.\", \"Mr. Ducey, who is one of Mr. Trump\\u2019s most frequent targets for his refusal to overturn Arizona\\u2019s vote for Mr. Biden, betrayed it-is-what-it-is fatigue with the former president. The governors would \\u201ccontrol the controllable,\\u201d he said. Attempting to consider Mr. Trump\\u2019s role, he added, was like \\u201ctrying to predict what can\\u2019t be predicted.\\u201d\", \"Most other Republican governors in Phoenix were just as uninterested in discussing Mr. Trump, displaying the sort of evasiveness many adopted while he was in office.\", \"Hustling to a panel session, Mr. Kemp dismissed a question about a challenge from Mr. Perdue by noting that he had already \\u201cmade statements on that.\\u201d Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, who faces a challenge from former Representative Jim Renacci, said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think the president is going to do that,\\u201d when asked about whether Mr. Trump would side with Mr. Renacci. Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump blames for not being allowed to hold a July 4 rally on the U.S.S. Alabama in Mobile, said she was \\u201cgoing to be fine\\u201d in her primary and then jumped in a waiting vehicle.\", \"And on the question of Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, perhaps the former president\\u2019s top Senate Republican target, the state\\u2019s governor, Mike Dunleavy, twice said only, \\u201cI\\u2019ll let people know,\\u201d when asked if he would support her.\", \"The Republicans most willing to speak frankly about Mr. Trump were those open to 2024 presidential runs.\", \"Mr. Sununu, the New Hampshire governor and political scion, who this month infuriated Senate Republicans by ridiculing the Senate and declining to challenge Senator Maggie Hassan, said, \\u201cI think Brian Kemp is doing a phenomenal job.\\u201d\", \"In an earlier political era, that would have been unremarkable praise for a fellow Republican governor. But in a news conference at the meeting here, not one of four Republicans on the dais was willing to offer such a vote of confidence in the Georgia governor.\", \"Mr. Perdue has inched closer to challenging Mr. Kemp, saying in a radio interview this week that a lot of Georgians believe that \\u201cpeople in power haven\\u2019t fought for them, and caved in to a lot of things back in 2020,\\u201d and that he was \\u201cconcerned about the state of our state.\\u201d\", \"As significant for the G.O.P.\\u2019s future, Mr. Sununu said, \\u201cYeah, sure,\\u201d when asked if he was open to a presidential bid, and made clear he would not defer to Mr. Trump. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a decision that I\\u2019m going to make based on what I can deliver, not based on what anyone else is thinking,\\u201d he said.\", \"The only other Republicans who appear at least willing to break with Mr. Trump on a case-by-case basis are Mr. McConnell and his top lieutenants. While they have rallied to the former football star Herschel Walker, whom Mr. Trump pushed to run for the Senate in Georgia, Mr. McConnell\\u2019s allies have made clear their support for Mr. Ducey and have stayed out of Senate races in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, where Mr. Trump has intervened.\", \"\\u201cAt the end of the day, in most of these races, we\\u2019re going to have credible, competitive candidates,\\u201d said Steven Law, who runs a McConnell-aligned Republican super PAC. \\u201cThere may be a few places where we need to be engaged to make sure we put our best foot forward.\\u201d\", \"Some Republican Senate strategists are having painful flashbacks to the last big G.O.P. wave, in 2010, when Republicans swept more than 60 seats in the House but several weak Republican candidates lost key Senate contests.\", \"\\u201cRepublicans running bad candidates doesn\\u2019t guarantee Democrats will win,\\u201d said J.B. Poersch, president of the Senate Majority PAC, the leading Senate super PAC for Democrats. \\u201cBut it sure does help.\\u201d\", \"For now, public surveys and internal party polling show that support for Democrats is eroding \\u2014 the kind of political climate where even less-than-stellar Republican recruits might win.\", \"Perhaps what is giving Democrats the most solace is the calendar.\", \"\\u201cThe silver lining is it\\u2019s November 2021 and not November 2022,\\u201d said John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster who worked on Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign last year. He added, \\u201cWe\\u2019re probably at the worst point.\\u201d\", \"But Jeff Roe, who was the chief strategist for Mr. Youngkin\\u2019s campaign, said past presumptions that Republican primary voters would give little consideration to electability may not be accurate after the party fell entirely out of power in 2020.\", \"\\u201cElectability used to be fool\\u2019s gold in Republican politics,\\u201d said Mr. Roe, who was Senator Ted Cruz\\u2019s campaign manager in his 2016 bid for president. \\u201cNow it\\u2019s not. Now it\\u2019s a factor. Ideology is not the only measure anymore.\\u201d\", \"He added, \\u201cThe Republican electorate is allowing for imperfect nominees just to make sure we win.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b18b48064a1e11ecbe95fb4b3dc999b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b18b48064a1e11ecbe95fb4b3dc999b4"}},
