Giddings said she shared the blog post that revealed the young woman's identity because she felt it was the only article that showed \\\"both sides of the story\\\" and that she wanted to support \\\"due process\\\" for Representative Aaron von Ehlinger, the man accused of raping the young intern.\", \"\\\"I would not have done anything differently.
