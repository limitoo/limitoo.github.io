In contrast, one in 10 men say they are eating more meat these days than they were a few years ago.\\u00a0\", \"Why are some Americans eating less meat? By far the top reason cited is better health: more than half of adults who are eating less meat give that as the reason. Another 17% say it is because cutting down on meat is cheaper, while 11% say they simply like vegetables more. Fewer Americans give more humanitarian reasons, for instance, that it's better for the planet (8%) or is more humane to animals (7%).\\u00a0\", \"This poll was conducted by telephone November 9-14, 2021 among a random sample of 1,008 adults nationwide.\\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, PA.\\u202f Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. \\u00a0\", \"The poll employed a random digit dial methodology.
