While these kinds of incidents have been reported in several U.S. cities, the problem has been particularly prevalent in California's Los Angeles and Bay Area communities. In one case, about 80 people were estimated to have targeted a Nordstrom store in what police said was \\\"clearly a planned event\\\" in the Walnut Creek area.\", \"Further south, there was an estimated 3.9 percent increase in robberies reported in Los Angeles this year, according to Los Angeles Police Department data last updated in late November. The increase marks an uptick in robberies that have been reported this year to date, compared with those reported through the end of November 2020.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949675/robbery-reports-down-2021.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Crime data shows reports of robberies in a handful of major U.S. cities declined in 2021.

The list was included in the NRF's 2021 Retail Security Survey published in August.\", \"Also on the NRF's list was New York City, which saw a 4.5 percent increase in reported robberies this year compared with those reported through early December.\", \"But Chicago, which ranked third on the list, saw a 2 percent decline in reported robberies this year, according to police data last updated December 5. The police departments in Baltimore and Atlanta have also reported 6 percent and 8 percent declines, respectively, in the total number of robberies reported from the start of January through the end of November.\", \"In California, Sacramento and San Francisco are two of the cities that have been hit hardest by the smash-and-grab robbery trend. Both cities reported a decline between 4 and 5 percent in robberies for 2021.\", \"Even with some cities experiencing a decline in reported robberies, the smash-and-grab spree that has captured the public's attention in recent weeks prompted some officials to take action. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom recently instructed the California Highway Patrol to boost officers' presence near retail outlets in support of the state's Organized Retail Crime Task Force, and Florida's attorney general announced earlier this month the creation of the Florida Organized Retail Crime Exchange.\", \"A handful of major U.S. cities have dominated the conversation about smash-and-grab incidents in recent weeks, but industry leaders say it's a nationwide problem.\", \"\\\"These incidents unfortunately have been increasing for some time now for several years,\\\" said Jason Straczewski, the vice president of government relations and political relations at the NRF.\", \"\\\"You can't just look at this as something that's a local problem or a problem in a particular state,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"The coverage of late has obviously focused a lot on California and Southern Chicago, but what our retailers tell us is that this is not just a big-city problem, and this is not something that is confined to one or two areas of the country,\\\" Brewer said. \\\"Organized retail crime is not something that discriminates or wears a particular party hat or is more or less susceptible in a certain community. It really is everywhere.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"a11283a55a1f11ecba39d10c09f8c42d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a11283a55a1f11ecba39d10c09f8c42d"}},
