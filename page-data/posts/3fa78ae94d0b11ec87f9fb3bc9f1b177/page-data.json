This bear learned how to close the front door to my house,\\\" she wrote in the caption.\", \"In the video, Kehoe can be heard saying \\\"is it raining outside?\\\" before she opens her door to look around. As she pans the camera down, a bear appears in the shot on the steps to her door.\", \"\\\"Oooh, who do we have here?\\\" she says. \\\"Mr. Bear, will you please close my door?\\\" She repeats the command several times as the bear comes closer to the doorway. \\\"Close the door Mr. Bear,\\\" Kehoe says.\", \"The bear then gently takes hold of the door handle and pulls it towards itself, almost closing the door completely.\", \"\\\"You have to finish closing it, sweetie, the cold air is coming in,\\\" she says. \\\"Close the door, sweetie, Thank you.\\\"\", \"Kehoe, from Vernon, is known for her interactions with bears.
