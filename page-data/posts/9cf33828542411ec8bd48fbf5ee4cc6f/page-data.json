Their friends loved it.\", \"\\u201cI tried to fight it,\\u201d Ms. Epstein said. \\u201cBut no one listened. Now our close friends call us Bulz and Schmulz.\\u201d\", \"Originally from Aventura, Fla., Ms. Epstein, 31, now lives with Mr. Cassif in his native Tel Aviv, \\u201cwhich is pretty funny because my parents are Israelis who made their way to the States,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI am first generation American, and here I am having made the opposite move.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Cassif, 33, graduated from Reichman University with a degree in communications. He is a project manager for Breeze Creative, which is based in Bnei Atarot, Israel.

They were at a birthday party for one of Mr. Cassif\\u2019s friends, who is also a friend of Ms. Epstein\\u2019s second cousin\\u2019s husband. \\u201cI was immediately drawn to her,\\u201d Mr. Cassif said. \\u201cI thought she was cute and had a fun energy.\\u201d\", \"From then on, Ms. Epstein said, \\u201cwe pretty much spent the rest of my trip together.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAt first, he probably didn\\u2019t understand like half of what I was saying, and we\\u2019re both pretty sure that was what made us work,\\u201d she added jokingly.\", \"[Click here to binge read this week\\u2019s featured couples.]\", \"Ms. Epstein, who was living in Los Angeles when they met, reached out to Mr. Cassif via social media after returning from the trip. They then texted and had video dates, although, they said, it wasn\\u2019t serious at that point.\", \"\\u201cWe obviously felt there was a connection,\\u201d Ms. Epstein said, \\u201cbut didn\\u2019t know where it would go.\\u201d\", \"The next summer, Ms. Epstein went back to Israel, where she officially relocated to in August 2016 when she accepted a Tel Aviv-based job in television development and moved in with Mr. Cassif. \\u201cIt was a practical decision,\\u201d he said of their choice to live together. \\u201cBut my heart told me things were moving in the right direction.\\u201d\", \"A proposal came almost four years later, in June 2020, at the Beresheet hotel in the Negev Desert. The morning they became engaged, Mr. Cassif told Ms. Epstein that he had a surprise for her.\", \"\\u201cGal told me to pack my bags,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAt first, I thought he was joking. He told me it was a\\u00a0\\u2018just because\\u2019 surprise, to get out of the city and relax. Of course, I had a feeling\\u00a0something\\u00a0was happening. That evening, he popped the question.\\u201d\", \"The couple were married at Ray, an event hall in Tel Aviv, on Nov. 4, three days after travel to Israel opened up to tourists on Nov. 1.

She wore a customized Pronovias gown, while he donned a navy suit, white shirt and a goose feather bow tie. Most of the guests stood for the ceremony performed by Rabbi Ariel Konstantyn of the Tel Aviv International Synagogue.\", \"After the breaking of the glass, guests stepped into the huppah to congratulate the couple and then passed through into the reception.\", \"Following a seated dinner, attendees were treated to a dessert bar in lieu of a cake. Two signature cocktails were served \\u2014 the Bulz and Schmulz \\u2014 and the dancing went on until 2 a.m.\", \"\\u201cIt was magnificent,\\u201d Mr. Cassif said. \\u201cThere was a lot of lifting up on the shoulders on the dance floor.
