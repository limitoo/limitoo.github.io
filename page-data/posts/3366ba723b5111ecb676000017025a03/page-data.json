Among the items being considered are transfers, restrictions on travel and the repayment of bonuses, the AP reports. Exemptions will be given for religious reasons, but on a case-by-case basis.\", \"Between 1 and 7 percent of all U.S. service members are unvaccinated, totaling around 60,000 members.\", \"One military branch is seeing success with its vaccination rate. The Navy has warned sailors that they could be disobeying a lawful order if they refuse to get a vaccination. Only 1 percent of sailors are unvaccinated, with some ships seeing vaccination rates up to 98 or 99 percent. Other branches of the military could make similar rules.\", \"The Air Force and Space Force deadline ends on November 2nd, with the Air Guard and Reserve's ending on December 2nd. Department of Defense workers must be vaccinated by November 22nd. The Navy and Marines' deadline is November 28th, with the reserves' ending on December 28th. Active-duty Army members must be immunized by December 15th, and the National Guard's deadline concludes on June 30th, 2022.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1923817/military-vaccination-deadline.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">In this Dec. 16, 2020, file photo, Staff Sgt.

But unlike most civilians, military personnel are routinely required to get as many as 17 vaccines, and face penalties for refusing.\", \"It is unclear how widely religious exemptions will be granted. Under military rules, commanders can take into account the potential impact on a unit's mission, and reject a religious exemption if it puts performance at risk.\", \"Unvaccinated troops will also be subject to routine testing, distancing guidelines and possibly travel restrictions.\", \"Air Force Col. Robert Corby, commander of the 28th Medical Group at Ellsworth Air Force Base, said that after the vaccine became mandatory in late August, appointments for shots at the base clinic doubled. He said troops have an array of questions and concerns, and commanders, chaplains and medical personnel are providing information.\", \"\\\"I think you also have a segment of the population that probably does not feel that they are really at risk for COVID-19,\\\" he added.\", \"Air Force Capt. Molly Lawlor, 28th Bomb Wing chaplain, said a \\\"very small percentage\\\" are seeking a religious exemption at the base. \\\"People are just trying to figure out how this new requirement fits into their belief system and the decisions that they want to make,\\\" she said.\", \"Supervisors are grappling with the complex task of checking and recording the vaccine status of their workers, and determining who will be the final exemption arbiter.\", \"Civilians have until Nov. 8 to seek an exemption, and as of last week, fewer than half had provided vaccination proof. Those who refuse the vaccine and don't get an exemption will get five days for counseling. If they still refuse, they will be suspended for up to 14 days without pay, and could then be fired.\", \"Vaccination numbers fluctuate for the military services, and drop off considerably for the National Guard and Reserve.\", \"A bit more than half of the Army National Guard has gotten at least one shot, while the Air Guard is at 87 percent. Air Guard members must be fully vaccinated by early December, while the Army Guard, which is much larger and more widely scattered around the country, has until June.\", \"Marine Col. Speros Koumparakis, commander of Marine Corps Base Hawaii, said that the number of Marines who have requested exemptions at the base is fewer than two dozen, and most of those are seeking religious exemptions.\", \"He said chaplains and pastors have been made available to discuss the religious issues, and he does the initial review of any request. But ultimately, decisions may be made by personnel leaders at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia.\"]","href_hash":"3366ba723b5111ecb676000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3366ba723b5111ecb676000017025a03"}},
