If it has a risk weighting of 40 per cent, the bank only has to hold capital against that at-risk portion.\", \"So, for example, if a bank was required to hold 10 per cent capital, it would have to hold $100,000 in capital against a million-dollar loan with a 100 per cent risk weight, but only $40,000 against the same-sized loan with a 40 per cent risk weight.\", \"To give a simple example from APRA's new policy, under its \\\"standardised\\\" model (used by the smaller and mid-sized banks) the risk weighting on an owner-occupier home loan that is for less than half the value of the property is 20 per cent, but it is double that (40 per cent) for mortgage with a loan-to-value (LVR) ratio between 80 and 90 per cent.\", \"So a bank would have to hold twice as much capital against the 80-90 per cent LVR loan as it does against the one below 50 per cent.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/86f7f3066251dc67f4b7def21f150886\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The risk of a mortgage rises when the size of the loan is larger relative to the valuation of the property.(Supplied: APRA)</div>\", \"As you can see from the graph, for any given LVR, investor loans and longer-term interest-only loans will have a higher risk weight than owner-occupier principal and interest mortgages.\", \"Therefore they are likely to continue having higher interest rates. The benefit may go to owner-occupiers with large deposits or lots of equity in their home, who are likely to continue seeing relatively cheaper mortgages.\", \"While the standardised risk weightings do not apply to the major banks, and some other larger institutions that use APRA-approved internal risk models, the same principles will apply.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Business loans may become cheaper relative to mortgages</div>\", \"APRA figures show that the major banks, on average, are likely to see a small reduction in their risk-weighted assets under the new rules, which may mean they can slightly reduce the capital they hold.\", \"However, the regulator indicated that this is due to a fall in risk weights for commercial property and large corporate loans, while mortgages will see a slight increase in overall capital requirements.\", \"\\\"One of the objectives of the new framework has been to strengthen the amount of capital held by banks for residential mortgage lending, given the industry concentration in this asset class,\\\" noted an information paper released by the regulator.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/2f2f4227115f3a24b25db48d8b8feb00\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Around two-thirds of Australian bank assets are residential mortgages, around three times more than the UK and double the US.(Supplied: APRA)</div>\", \"\\\"Under the new framework, APRA has increased capital for residential mortgages relative to other asset classes, and better distinguished higher and lower risk lending.\\\"\", \"APRA also noted that risk weights for small and medium enterprises will be lowered for banks using its standardised approach, potentially facilitating slightly cheaper lending to this sector.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/96d96e3f49b78e706e260d377fc160c8\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Residential property is still seen as by far the safest form of lending, with property development by far the riskiest.(Supplied: APRA)</div>\", \"APRA chair Wayne Byres said an unquestionably strong banking industry is central to the stability of the financial system.\", \"\\\"Capital is the cornerstone of the banking system's safety and stability,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Although Australia's banking sector is already strongly capitalised by international standards, the new capital framework will help ensure it stays that way.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"d248079c50e911ec960019ee86e45c39"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d248079c50e911ec960019ee86e45c39"}},
