The demonstrators had also protested an effort launched by one of the defense lawyers, Kevin Gough, to ban from the courtroom high-profile Black activists, including Rev. Al Sharpton and Rev. Jesse Jackson, who have at various times appeared alongside Mr. Arbery\\u2019s family members in the gallery.\", \"Mr. McMichael, 35, was the only one of the three white men charged in the murder case to take the stand. His lawyers have argued that he was fulfilling a \\u201cduty and responsibility\\u201d to his family and neighborhood by pursuing Mr. Arbery, whom he believed to be a suspicious character in a neighborhood beset with concerns abut property crime.\", \"Defense lawyers contend that Mr. McMichael, along with the other two men \\u2014 Travis\\u2019s father, Gregory McMichael, 65, and their neighbor William Bryan, 52 \\u2014 were carrying out a legal citizen\\u2019s arrest and that Travis McMichael acted in self-defense in firing on Mr. Arbery with a shotgun at close range.\", \"Linda Dunikoski, the lead prosecutor, began her interrogation on Thursday by handing Mr. McMichael a transcript of his initial testimony to the police. She proceeded to draw out a number of inconsistencies in his various tellings of the way the three men, who were in a pair of pickup trucks, chased Mr. Arbery as he ran through their neighborhood.\", \"She unleashed a series of questions that appeared designed to raised doubts about whether Mr. Arbery, who was unarmed, posed a legitimate threat. \\u201cDid Mr. Arbery reach into his pockets?\\u201d she asked, and continued in that vein: Did he yell? Threaten you? Brandish weapons? Gun? Knife?\", \"To each of these, Mr. McMichael answered no.\", \"\\u201cHe just ran?\\u201d she asked.\", \"\\u201cYes,\\u201d he replied.\", \"On Wednesday, Mr. McMichael had testified that Mr. Arbery had grabbed Mr. McMichael\\u2019s shotgun. But on Thursday, Ms. Dunikoski noted that he told an investigator in an earlier interview that he could not remember whether Mr. Arbery grabbed it or not.\", \"Mr. McMichael\\u2019s lawyers have argued that his training, when he was in the U.S. Coast Guard, gave him a working understanding of the concept of \\u201cprobable cause,\\u201d and that he had probable cause to believe Mr. Arbery was a burglar, even though Mr. Arbery, who had visited a partially built house in the neighborhood several times, was never seen taking anything from it.\", \"Ms. Dunikoski has argued that the three men had no \\u201cimmediate knowledge\\u201d that a crime had been committed.\", \"\\u201cIsn\\u2019t it true from your training that you need two parts of probable cause?\\u201d she asked on Thursday. \\u201cYou need probable cause that a crime has actually been committed \\u2014 and that the person you\\u2019re arresting is actually the one who committed the crime.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThat is correct,\\u201d Mr. McMichael replied.\", \"Ms. Dunikoski also noted that Mr. McMichael had made a number of statements about crime and vigilantism on social media. In one online post, on the topic of neighborhood crime, he stated that his father \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t care about going to jail.\\u201d He added, \\u201cHell, I\\u2019m getting that way,\\u201d and told one neighbor that he hoped the perpetrators of a crime she described would be caught, calling the perpetrators \\u201cvermin.\\u201d\", \"Outside the courthouse on Thursday afternoon, Black pastors and others from around the country, including Mr. Sharpton and Mr. Jackson, marched through the streets. When they arrived at a mural of Mr. Arbery, his aunt, Diane Arbery Jackson, addressed the group and asked the marchers to keep praying for her family.\", \"Defense lawyers on Thursday also called six residents of the Satilla Shores neighborhood where Mr. Arbery was killed, each of whom described concerns about property crimes in the neighborhood, a key to the lawyers\\u2019 broader argument that the community was \\u201con edge\\u201d when security cameras began capturing Mr. Arbery visiting the house under construction.\", \"Sube Lawrence, one of the witnesses, testified that she felt \\u201cviolated\\u201d by crime. Through tears, she said she was upset that her children were unable to grow up in a neighborhood as safe as the one she was raised in.\", \"Earlier in the day, Ms. Dunikoski asked permission to tell the jury about Mr. Bryan\\u2019s contention that Mr. McMichael used a racist slur moments after his confrontation with Mr. Arbery. But before the judge could rule on the matter, the defense rested its case, and Ms. Dunikoski declined her right to present rebuttal witnesses.\"]","href_hash":"a0a45bd748d111ec92e703fc5c865c0b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a0a45bd748d111ec92e703fc5c865c0b"}},
