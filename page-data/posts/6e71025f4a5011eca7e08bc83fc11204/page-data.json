While barely any of Biden's diplomats have been confirmed by the Senate, the bulk of former Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama's nominees had been confirmed at this point in their White House tenures.\", \"Representative Jaimie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, previously warned that the blockade was causing problems internationally for the U.S.\", \"\\\"It's a terrible impediment to our resuming democratic partnership and leadership in the world,\\\" Raskin recently told The Guardian.\", \"\\\"The right-wing plan has been to dismantle and disable democratic governance and leadership. They want to make the government dysfunctional so they can take it over and use it for their own purposes,\\\" he said.\", \"Notably, Risch has also been seen as holding up some of the nominees in the committee process before they go to the full Senate floor for confirmation. He has said that they should be fully vetted by the Republican minority.\", \"\\\"The fact of the matter is that it's not going to be a situation where we're going to roll over on ones that we're not done with,\\\" the Idaho lawmaker said earlier this month, The Hill reported.\", \"In late October, the White House took aim at Cruz for obstructing the confirmation of \\\"dozens\\\" of Biden's nominees.\", \"\\\"President Biden is quickly working to restore America's position on the world stage, and he's moved swiftly to nominate well-qualified ambassadors who have earned Republican and Democratic support,\\\" White House spokesperson Chris Meagher told The Washington Post. \\\"But instead of putting politics aside, Sen. Cruz has led an unprecedented effort of obstruction by blocking dozens of President Biden's nominees and preventing them from advancing America's national security interests.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"6e71025f4a5011eca7e08bc83fc11204"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6e71025f4a5011eca7e08bc83fc11204"}},
