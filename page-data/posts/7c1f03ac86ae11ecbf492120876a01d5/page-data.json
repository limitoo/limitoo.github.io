He called for \\\"the most strenuous exertions, a perfect unity of purpose ... unrelenting tenacity\\\". Only then, he said, would Britain be able to \\\"act our part worthily in the prodigious world drama in which we are now plunged\\\".\", \"Churchill was a flawed man, an imperfect leader who had survived triumph and disaster. In World War I he had been sacked from the war cabinet for his involvement in the disastrous Gallipoli campaign.\", \"Seen through today's eyes he is often cast\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0and not without some foundation \\u2014\\u00a0as a racist and imperialist. The weights are still being added to the scale of Churchill's historical legacy.\", \"Yet in the midst of war, Churchill offered certainty and determination.

But who believes him?\\u00a0\", \"After the ignominy of American retreat from Afghanistan, where is American resolve?\\u00a0\", \"Biden says it is wrong to bet against America. But the Taliban did and, after 20 years of war, it emerged victorious.

North Korea is betting against America. Vladimir Putin, with 100,000-plus\\u00a0troops amassed on Ukraine's border, is most certainly betting against America.\", \"Why wouldn't he? Last month Biden openly mused about how the West might tolerate a small scale Russian invasion. \\\"It's one thing if it's a minor incursion,\\\" he said, \\\"then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do, et cetera.\\\"\", \"Well, there's an invitation to Putin. Imagine Churchill offering Hitler the same.\", \"The Fuhrer certainly fancied his chances against Britain but he would never have been left in any doubt that Britain would fight.\", \"Putin has seen off successive US Presidents during his two decades in power in Russia. He has reconstituted Russian power. In the absence of American resolve, he has invaded Georgia, propped up the Assad regime in Syria, waged war in Ukraine, annexed Crimea, strengthened his military and built up Russia's foreign currency reserves.\", \"Now he openly prepares for an invasion of Ukraine and the West, led by the United States, still prevaricates or speaks in muted tones. The US threatens sanctions when Putin threatens war.\", \"In Europe, NATO allies like Germany worry about the impact of the loss of Russian energy supplies.

It should have been his chance to speak seriously and directly to the Australian people at a time of enormous disruption, upheaval and threat.\", \"What did we get? Questions about text messages between former New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian and an anonymous federal cabinet minister describing the Prime Minister as a \\\"horrible person\\\" and a \\\"psycho\\\".\", \"Morrison was asked to say sorry to the Australian people for his mistakes in handling the COVID pandemic.

But no apology would be enough. Admitting mistakes is not seen as a sign of leadership or strength, but weakness.\", \"What would Churchill do? Well, in another speech of reassurance to a nation battered and bombarded, he said:\\u00a0\", \"Now, we are not in the midst of a global war. But we are certainly still battling with a devastating pandemic that has been likened to a war. And we are a hair-trigger away from a potential catastrophic conflict.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Serious conversations we're not having</div>\", \"There is another discussion underway in Australia \\u2014\\u00a0one we didn't hear much of at the National Press Club. The day after Morrison's speech, while pundits were still talking about nasty texts and bread, another conference was held in Canberra to discuss our military readiness in the case of war.\", \"It was all about how we build our sovereign defence capability. How strong are our supply chains? What is the capacity of our defence contractors? How much do we rely on the rest of the world? How do we build more self-sufficiency? Will we be able to deliver on the AUKUS nuclear submarines deal?\", \"These are serious questions. It is about nation building at a time when we don't talk enough about it. Instead, we talk about identity groups and engage in culture wars.\\u00a0\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c12d38cfcda485e342ec2c35817f5e54\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Xi\\u00a0and Putin speak with certainty and directly challenge what has been called a liberal democratic global order.(Reuters: Jason Lee)</div>\", \"The defence contractors conference brought together serious-minded people who know how high the stakes are right now.

Because Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin are certainly having that conversation. Yet the conference received scant coverage, drowned out by bread, texts and smiles.\", \"Churchill, touring the battered cities of Britain, said he saw the impact of the \\\"malice of our assailants\\\". But while the buildings were \\\"shattered and gutted\\\", he said, \\\"it has not had the heart of its people cast down\\\".\", \"Churchill promised then, in the darkest hour, that \\\"all will be better for the world and there will a crown of honour to those who have endured and never failed\\\".\", \"Years of war and death and sacrifice lay ahead. But the prime minister and allies prevailed.\", \"Churchill's language, his emphasis on values, endurance and sacrifice can seem so anachronistic today.
