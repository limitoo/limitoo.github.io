Hell, it\\u2019s fashionable. It\\u2019s also safe. Over some 35 years in journalism, I\\u2019ve routinely seen pundits and reporters ridiculed for believing too much in someone or something, but believing too little? That\\u2019s a measure of mental toughness, of professional incorruptibility. Or so many of us in the news business tell ourselves.\", \"Is that why we\\u2019ve rushed quickly past the $1 trillion infrastructure legislation that President Biden signed into law on Monday and resumed our preferred focus on the more sprawling and thornier Build Back Better bill, whose fate is uncertain? Does that explain an obsession with Biden\\u2019s troubles that blots out his progress?\", \"He indeed has troubles: We\\u2019re not making up his job-approval numbers, which are dangerously low. But we may be depressing them.\", \"We\\u2019re not making up the bitter differences between moderates and progressives in the Democratic Party, we didn\\u2019t hallucinate Democrats\\u2019 recent comeuppance in Virginia, and we\\u2019re not inventing the signs that Democrats could fare badly in the midterm elections.\", \"But \\u2014 hello! \\u2014 those elections are still almost a year away. You\\u2019d never know it from the frequency with which they\\u2019re mentioned in the news media, which has made them the dominant and sometimes sole lens through which everything in Washington is viewed. The furious metabolism of the news and the unpredictability of events (pandemic, anyone?) suggest that the situation in November 2022 won\\u2019t precisely mirror the situation in November 2021. But we blithely ignore that.\", \"And we too seldom pull back and look at the longer narrative, the larger picture. We certainly downgrade the positive. Soon after Biden took office, Congress passed and he signed the American Rescue Plan, a nearly $2 trillion economic stimulus and relief bill. After that, Congress passed and he signed this $1 trillion infrastructure package. That\\u2019s a troika of trillions. That\\u2019s not nothing.\", \"And it\\u2019s not nothing that the infrastructure legislation garnered bipartisan support. Too many of us have skimmed over that, too.\", \"So my eye was drawn to the headline on Politico\\u2019s West Wing Playbook on Monday evening: \\u201cBiden proves the haters wrong.\\u201d I\\u2019d quibble with the rosiness of the paragraphs below it, by Alex Thompson and Tina Sfondeles, except that they seem to me a necessary retort to, and rebuke of, our skimming. They right the scales. And the haters have been loud and proud.\", \"What Biden signed on Monday is a major deal. In an article in The Times, Jim Tankersley called it \\u201cthe most important step in a generation toward upgrading critical infrastructure.\\u201d In The Morning newsletter in The Times, David Leonhardt noted that it would \\u201craise federal infrastructure spending to its highest share of G.D.P. since the early 1980s.\\u201d David also wisely acknowledged its ambiguities, the impossibility of knowing exactly how much good it would do and \\u201csome hyperbole\\u201d in Biden\\u2019s description of it.\", \"Even so, the country took a step forward. Washington got something done. Biden racked up an accomplishment. There\\u2019s no arguing with any of that.\", \"The quirks and cruelties of American politics are such that he and Democrats may not reap much gratitude or credit, though. Many voters look narrowly at their immediate economic circumstances \\u2014 how flush or not they feel, how anxious or not they are \\u2014 and decide from that whether to stick with the party in charge or give the opposition a chance, and inflation is pummeling Biden. Supply-chain problems aren\\u2019t helping. He can\\u2019t fully control either. He\\u2019ll answer for both.\", \"And Democrats do find themselves on a difficult side of a culture war, with a set of talking points about it that don\\u2019t resonate with some of the voters whom the party needs, and with an aura of arrogance that turns plenty of voters off.\", \"But the oft-repeated assertion that Biden and the party are flat-out failing isn\\u2019t fair. I myself fell prey to excessive negativity and overstatement when, in a newsletter a month ago, I wrote that he was lurching about in a manner that called his administrative and legislative competence into question.\", \"It\\u2019s true that this infrastructure bill traveled a tortured path, that the prior American Rescue Plan was passed along strictly partisan lines, that the southern border remains a mess and that Biden\\u2019s avoidance of interviews and occasionally jumbled remarks don\\u2019t inspire enormous confidence. It\\u2019s true that all these developments and dynamics don\\u2019t add up to the efficiency and normalcy that he promised during his campaign.\", \"But it\\u2019s also true that he just did more for American\\u2019s beleaguered infrastructure than his immediate predecessors in the White House managed to. It\\u2019s true that the stasis broke and sense prevailed. To respond with skepticism is perhaps appropriate: The infrastructure legislation almost surely represents an inadequate level of investment, and it\\u2019s a mere fraction of the Biden agenda. But cynicism is off base. While it pantomimes sophistication, it reeks of simple-mindedness.\", \"I\\u2019ll always remember the first time I saw, in person, Chris Christie work an audience. He was the headliner at a fund-raiser for charter schools nearly a decade ago, and for some 30 minutes, he spoke largely without notes, in shapely paragraphs, mixing erudition and folksiness in perfect measures, his energy never flagging. Few politicians are gifted quite like that. I was certain he was going places.\", \"I felt the same way about Beto O\\u2019Rourke. As he campaigned in Texas in 2018 to dislodge Ted Cruz from his Senate seat, he conveyed a similar amalgam of learnedness and looseness. He had that same crazy fluency. Every story he told had a beginning, an end and a moral, and every room he entered crackled with his presence. He felt it \\u2014 you could tell. He fed off it.\", \"Both men re-emerged over the past week: Christie in a new role as Trump apostate; O\\u2019Rourke as a candidate in the 2022 race for Texas governor. Both are intent on comebacks. And that speaks to something else they had in common: Both were in a rush. Exhilarated by their reception, they overestimated their powers, overplayed their hands and stumbled, Christie flopping badly in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, O\\u2019Rourke limping away from the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. They learned \\u2014 and retaught us \\u2014 that political favor is fickle and contextual, and timing is everything.\", \"That\\u2019s not to equate them. O\\u2019Rourke has nothing like Christie\\u2019s George Washington Bridge fiasco or past indulgence of Trump to answer for. They have markedly different strains of hubris, with significantly different implications. Christie\\u2019s belongs in a scary thriller, O\\u2019Rourke\\u2019s in a romantic comedy.\", \"But they\\u2019re comparably fascinating because they\\u2019re comparably talented: How will each respond to his party\\u2019s predicament? Might he have answers that his peers can emulate? Can Christie, with his considerable gifts, chart a post-Trump, pro-truth path for Republicans? Can O\\u2019Rourke, with his, connect with voters alienated by the Democratic Party\\u2019s cultural progressivism?\", \"Whatever the case, the American political scene is more interesting with than without them.\", \"There were many priceless moments in Caity Weaver\\u2019s profile in The Times of Sam Asghari, a.k.a. Mr. Britney Spears, and while most can be wholly appreciated only in the context of the entire article, a few sentences do just fine on their own. Like this one, about two of Asghari\\u2019s intrusive and fidgety handlers: \\u201cIf Mr. Asghari is the heart of the Sam Asghari business, Maxi and Mr. Cohen are the palpitations.\\u201d And this one, about his response to all their fussing: \\u201cAfter each disruption, he retrieved the path of his thoughts as nonchalantly as a storm-blown songbird recovers its migratory route to the tropics.\\u201d (Thanks to Allan Tarlow of West Hollywood, Calif., and Susan Hembree of Albuquerque for these nominations.)\", \"Amanda Hess\\u2019s take on the cultural evolution of Botox is a similar buffet of delicious sentences, and I nominate these representative morsels: \\u201cThough there are several competing brands, Botox is the Kleenex of the category. It presents the kind of bargain one might strike with a nefarious sea witch: She will grant you eternal youth, but at the price of being able to move your face.\\u201d \\u201cBotox once suggested vanity, delusion and self-consciousness, but now it has fresh associations: with confidence, resilience, even authenticity, as the idea of \\u2018having work done\\u2019 has come to be seen as a legitimate form of work.\\u201d \\u201cFemale movie stars are no longer buried after a certain age; instead they are embalmed.\\u201d\", \"Sticking with The Times, Alexis Soloski described Juliette Lewis and other members of the cast of \\u201cYellowjackets,\\u201d a Showtime series, as actresses \\u201cwho shot to fame in the \\u201990s and are still picking out some of that shrapnel now.\\u201d (Jean Grossman, Kalamazoo, Mich.)\", \"Ginia Bellafante noted that Zephyr Teachout, who once ran against Andrew Cuomo for governor of New York, could benefit from his exile, \\u201cgiven that any political aspirations she had were unlikely to thrive while Mr. Cuomo remained in power, drinking thirstily from the spigot of retribution.\\u201d (Rudy Brynolfson, Minneapolis)\", \"Here\\u2019s Genevieve Ko on a late-stage step of proper mashed-potato making: \\u201cThe fork shouldn\\u2019t violently and erratically slice through the mash, but instead circle like a Ferris wheel, steady and gentle, up and down and back around.\\u201d (Jo Wollschlaeger, Portland, Ore.)\", \"And here\\u2019s Bret Stephens on his own breakthrough case of Covid: \\u201cI\\u2019ve lost my senses of taste and smell, which, given that I\\u2019ve received multiple care packages from Zabar\\u2019s, makes me feel like the eunuch at the orgy.\\u201d (Larry Berman, Westfield, N.J., and Betsy Johnson, Ipswich, Mass., among others)\", \"Boris Johnson, like Donald Trump, has been the subject of so many writerly put-downs that novel ones are hard to come by, but Marina Hyde cleared that hurdle in The Guardian by mentioning \\u201can edifying week in the government of Britain, a country run by the third prize in a competition to build Winston Churchill out of marshmallows.\\u201d (Ellen Hubbard, Oxford, England)\", \"On the Celtics Blog, Adam Taylor recently asserted: \\u201cWhile the Boston Celtics offense is still a work in progress, we\\u2019re seeing signs of life on the defensive end, not microbial life either \\u2014 we\\u2019re talking fully-fledged civilizations.\\u201d (Bob Bahm, Cape Elizabeth, Maine)\", \"And in Mother Jones, Stephanie Mencimer had this to say about the sale of a certain property in the nation\\u2019s capital: \\u201cIt turns out not even Rudy Giuliani\\u2019s bar tab could save the Trump International Hotel.\\u201d (Barbara Sloan, Conway, S.C.)\", \"To nominate favorite bits of recent writing from The Times or other publications to be mentioned in \\u201cFor the Love of Sentences,\\u201d please email me here, and please include your name and place of residence.\", \"I hadn\\u2019t spent an autumn in North Carolina since I went to college here more than three decades ago, so I couldn\\u2019t remember what the leaves did.\", \"Clearly, they loosened and then surrendered their grip on the branches to which they\\u2019d clung all summer long \\u2014 though I\\u2019m hardly an arborist, I could tell that just by the looks of them. But before the fall? Did they fade in a sickly fashion from green to brown \\u2014 death by dullness \\u2014 or did they go out in a blaze of orange, a burst of burgundy, a blast of yellow? Did they simper or strut?\", \"I got my answer from the Japanese maple in my front yard. About a week and a half ago, seemingly overnight, it went from whatever color it had been \\u2014 a hue so unremarkable I had no memory of it \\u2014 to a dazzling standoff between ruby and magenta. In the bold light of late morning, it shimmers. In the gentler light of late afternoon, it glows.\", \"It\\u2019s the focal point of the view from my dining room downstairs. It fills the picture window in my upstairs office. When Regan and I pass it at the beginning and end of every walk, I stand still beside it, marveling at its brilliance, marinating in its beauty. How wondrous it is.\", \"And how instructive.\", \"It arrived without warning, a gift that I hadn\\u2019t been hoping or waiting for, consistent with the generous, serendipitous ways of this world. It will depart soon \\u2014 not the tree, but this glorious phase of it. As with so much else, its preciousness is twinned with its evanescence. And so, a choice: Do I brace myself for the loss of it? Moderate my attachment to it accordingly? Or do I revel? Do I rejoice?\", \"Is the autumn half empty or half full?\", \"I always wrestle with that during this favorite season of mine, when the ground below me is magically carpeted with color and the sky above me miraculously canopied with it, an assertion of life that\\u2019s an announcement of death, a treat that\\u2019s a taunt because it times out so soon. But this year \\u2014 my first in this house, in this neighborhood, in this chapter of my life where I\\u2019m bent on appreciation \\u2014 the answer is easy. I revel. It\\u2019s the happy-making response, which makes it the wise one. And I\\u2019ve learned that gratitude is the serotonin of emotions. Why not pump my brain full of it?\", \"That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m doing when I lengthen my and Regan\\u2019s walks in the forest, so enchanted right now. It\\u2019s what I\\u2019m doing when I elect a slightly longer route home from my office at Duke, down a road whose edges are more densely wooded than those of the faster path.
