A look back shows what was lost.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-15T05:21:04.000Z","content":"[\"Many know Meredith Willson\\u2019s 1957 Broadway musical, \\u201cThe Music Man,\\u201d as a light comedy centered on a cheeky scam artist who pretends to be a musician and sells the idea of starting a boys\\u2019 band to a small town in Iowa. The show is being revived on Broadway starring Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster, and will begin performances this month.\", \"But several newly recognized drafts of the musical, written between 1954 and 1957, show that originally, the story focused more on the town\\u2019s persecution of a boy in a wheelchair \\u2014 carrying a much more serious message than the final draft. At the time, children with disabilities were routinely institutionalized in horrid conditions and denied an education.\", \"In the version that debuted in 1957, the only character that doesn\\u2019t fall for the scheme is Marian Paroo, a well-read single woman who has a shy younger brother with a lisp, named Winthrop. But the con man, Harold Hill, manages to charm Marian and wins her over in part by being kind to Winthrop and including him in the band.\", \"In the earlier drafts, Marian\\u2019s younger brother was a character named Jim Paroo, a boy in a wheelchair who, in some versions of the show, has limited use of his arms and could not speak. Wherever Jim goes, townspeople want to lock him up, and in some versions, this drives him to hide and live in the school basement instead of at home.\", \"Then, Harold comes along and challenges the community\\u2019s assumptions about Jim by bringing him into the band and finding an instrument he\\u2019s capable of playing with his limited range of motion. An early title for the show, \\u201cThe Silver Triangle,\\u201d highlights Jim\\u2019s instrument of choice and contribution to the band.\", \"\\u201cI think that Jim was very much at the heart of the show,\\u201d said Dominic Broomfield-McHugh, a musicology professor at the University of Sheffield in England who discovered many of the earlier drafts in 2013 at the Great American Songbook Foundation in Indiana. These discoveries were published in May in Broomfield-McHugh\\u2019s new book, \\u201cThe Big Parade: Meredith Willson\\u2019s Musicals from \\u2018The Music Man\\u2019 to \\u20181491.\\u2019\\u201d The book explores the musical\\u2019s journey from \\u201cThe Silver Triangle\\u201d to \\u201cThe Music Man\\u201d we know today \\u2014 and has a chapter devoted to the various early drafts of the show.\", \"\\u201cWhen you read the first draft, it feels quite thin until you get to the scenes with Jim or about Jim, and suddenly it becomes very dramatic and serious,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI still feel astonished when I look at it.\\u201d\", \"Most of the songs and scenes in earlier drafts are also significantly different, according to Broomfield-McHugh. In one deleted song, Jim, who is nonverbal in this version of the show, starts to sing onstage alone.\", \"\\u201cWhat Willson was trying to do was to sort of say, even though he can\\u2019t physically speak, he has all these thoughts and ideas going around in his head,\\u201d Broomfield-McHugh said.\", \"Though Willson\\u2019s writing of disability was sometimes gimmicky in ways that could now be seen as offensive \\u2014 in one scene, music inspires Jim to stand up for the first time \\u2014 Broomfield-McHugh believes that the playwright was trying to spark a conversation about how people with disabilities were treated at the time.\", \"He found evidence that the playwright had visited organizations for disabled children but couldn\\u2019t find any other personal reasons that Willson may have had for writing about this issue.\", \"Just 10 months before the show opened, Willson dropped the character of Jim, replacing him with Winthrop at the urging of producers who felt there was no place for serious representations of disability onstage.\", \"\\u201cBut I sense such a frustration in him that he really, really tried for years to make it work like this,\\u201d Broomfield-McHugh said.\", \"One memo urged Willson to change the character, stating that \\u201cphysical disability in a child is impossible to view in any terms but pity and sentiment, the problem is to find some other form of disability besides physical.\\u201d The memo is undated and unsigned, but Broomfield-McHugh believes it was written in early 1957 by an employee of a producer. He found it in Wisconsin Historical Society archives, tucked in the back of a script that belonged to the producer Kermit Bloomgarden, who took over production of the show in 1957.\", \"Another letter to Willson, written in 1955 by the playwrights Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, says, \\u201cThe easy solution is to dump Jim Paroo,\\u201d but that doing so \\u201cmight conceivably reduce a major work to the dimension of mere entertainment.\\u201d\", \"Today, audiences can more regularly see disabled actors onstage thanks to efforts by small theater companies like The Apothetae, which produces works centered on the disabled experience; and Theater Breaking Through Barriers, an Off Broadway organization that regularly casts actors with disabilities.\", \"But on Broadway, which can elevate shows into mainstream commercial hits, authentic representations of disability are still few and far between, said Talleri A. McRae, a founder of National Disability Theater.\", \"There have been some successes. Ali Stroker made history in 2019 as the first actor in a wheelchair to win a Tony Award for her role as a flirty fianc\\u00e9e, Ado Annie, in \\u2018Oklahoma!\\u2019; Madison Ferris, who has muscular dystrophy and uses a wheelchair, played Laura in a 2017 production of \\u201cThe Glass Menagerie.\\u201d There was also the casting of a disabled actor in the role of Tiny Tim in \\u201cA Christmas Carol\\u201d in 2019; a 2015 revival of \\u201cSpring Awakening\\u201d by Deaf West Theater, which featured deaf and hearing actors side by side; as well as Martyna Majok\\u2019s Pulitzer-winning 2017 Off Broadway play, \\u201cCost of Living,\\u201d about people with disabilities.\", \"Even with this progress, many disabled characters are not written in well-rounded ways, and actors without disabilities are often cast in these roles, McRae said.\", \"To her knowledge, the character of Nessarose in \\u201cWicked\\u201d \\u2014 who uses a wheelchair \\u2014 has never been played by a disabled actress on Broadway, and the same was true for the character of Crutchie, who uses a crutch in the show \\u201cNewsies.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cLook how far we haven\\u2019t come,\\u201d said Gregg Mozgala, an actor with cerebral palsy and the founder and artistic director of the Apothetae. \\u201cOr how far we have yet to go.\\u201d\", \"Part of the problem is inaccessibility for acting training programs, said Mozgala, who is also the director of inclusion for the Queens Theater\\u2019s program Theater for All, which helps support and train disabled playwrights and actors. In his own acting program at the Boston University School for the Arts, he was the only person who identified as disabled and said many actors with disabilities have been told to sit out of certain classes, such as movement classes, because professors felt uncomfortable teaching students with disabilities.\", \"Another barrier is the perception of audiences. Nicholas Viselli, the artistic director of Theater Breaking Through Barriers, said audiences still feel uncomfortable watching disabled actors or characters onstage. For the plays he stages, he said he often receives donations from people who say they think the work is important but don\\u2019t want to come see it.\", \"\\u201cWhen you advertise disability, it becomes a turnoff,\\u201d Viselli said. \\u201cPeople are like, \\u2018I\\u2019ll feel bad for them. It will perhaps diminish my experience.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"In the end, the version of \\u201cThe Music Man\\u201d without Jim was a hit; it won five Tony Awards, including best musical, ran for 1,375 performances and was adapted into an Oscar-winning movie in 1962.\", \"\\u201cThe Music Man\\u201d has since been criticized for making light of its con artist\\u2019s problematic, predatory behavior, such as a scene in which he follows Marian home and tries multiple times to seduce her.\", \"The legacy of \\u201cThe Music Man\\u201d may have been different if Willson\\u2019s original vision had made it onto the Broadway stage in a way that authentically represented people with disabilities. Many of the stigmas and barriers it tried to confront still persist, according to Penny Pun, the managing director of the National Disability Theater.\", \"\\u201cA lot of these works are being put down before they even see the light of day,\\u201d Pun said. \\u201cSo how do we know if they have mainstream appeal? They never get a chance.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b333fb985d6611ec9ff21f4b3757d253"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b333fb985d6611ec9ff21f4b3757d253"}},
