concerning either, because it was mainly being driven by temporary factors.\", \"The RBA\\u00a0released its latest quarterly forecasts for the economy on Friday, and they contained significant upgrades.\", \"It suggested\\u00a0Australia's economy was showing signs of a strong recovery from the recent lockdowns on the east coast.\", \"It said if the\\u00a0momentum continued, we could\\u00a0see employment growing faster than anticipated in coming years.\", \"That would\\u00a0drive unemployment down faster, and\\u00a0see wages growth pick up to 3 per cent by the end of 2023

rate of growth in a decade.\", \"The RBA said that was its central scenario.\", \"\\\"Wages growth should continue to pick up in the near term, as the remaining wage freezes and cuts implemented in 2020 are unwound and labour market conditions tighten,\\\" the RBA said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/164b1d4c3d43d8002d82a5b44ae4ce30\\\"

experiencing wage increases above 3 per cent was still much lower than it was in the 2000s.\", \"It\\u00a0said many firms experiencing difficulties finding labour were still trying to attract and

acute, such as some types of IT professionals, trades persons and chefs.\", \"However, it said\\u00a0based on information from the Bank\\u2019s liaison program, firms were reporting that the
