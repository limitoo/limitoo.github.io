The passengers in question are allowed to contest the fines. However, the airline crews were forced to divert the planes for some of the passengers' behavior.\", \"Over this past year, over $1.45 million in fines have been issued, according to CNN.

Of those, nearly 4,000 have been mask-related incidents.\", \"At the beginning of November, 37 of the most serious cases were sent to federal court, as the FAA isn't allowed to prosecute airline passengers.\", \"The fines are part of the FAA's zero-tolerance campaign signed in January earlier this year. Passengers with disorderly conduct could face criminal charges, lifetime bans from airlines, as well as fines, according to NBC News.\", \"\\\"Flying is the safest mode of transportation and I signed this order to keep it that way,\\\" FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said.\", \"In a typical year, the FAA sees between 100 to 150 cases regarding passengers' rowdy behavior, according to NBC News.
