That experience of restriction, he writes in \\u201cIn Absentia,\\u201d a limited-edition book chronicling his life after the shutdown, reminded him of his early years \\u2014 specifically a time in the 1980s when his studio space was his living room on St. Marks Place.\", \"It was less than ideal \\u2014 he kept crashing into furniture \\u2014 but Petronio, who calls himself a positive nihilist, choreographed a solo that spoke to his working conditions. He planted his feet in fourth position, and for the solo\\u2019s eight-minute duration, that is where they stayed.\", \"\\u201cPetronio Punk Picks and Other Delights,\\u201d his latest evening of work, takes place, fittingly, in his old stomping ground: Manhattan\\u2019s East Village. In a series of short works created from 1993 to the present, Petronio unveils a survey of sorts at the Ellen Stewart Theater at La MaMa.\", \"There were some impressive performances, yet however articulate and imperative his dancers were, the 12 short works \\u2014 11 of them excerpts from longer pieces \\u2014 exposed a sameness in Petronio\\u2019s explosive, sleek vocabulary of twisting torsos, lashing legs and whipping arms. The costumes changed, the music changed, but the bodies, veritable ribbons of flesh, were too often stuck on repeat.\", \"Strangely, Petronio\\u2019s portion of the evening took place entirely in Act 2. The first half featured another choreographer at his invitation: Johnnie Cruise Mercer of TheREDprojectNYC. A vague program note states that the Petronio company had joined forces with Mercer, who in his premiere \\u2014 titled \\u201cand then we hit the boundary where the sun\\u2019s wind ceased.\\u201d \\u2014 paused several times with his feet in fourth position, his arms stretched to either side like low wings. But beyond an apparent shared fondness for that shape, one foot in front of the other and at least a foot apart, it didn\\u2019t seem like much more than a shared evening.\", \"Mercer\\u2019s work, according to program notes, is part of a larger project. During the run, which ends Sunday, he will continue to explore characters based on the four horsemen in the Book of Revelations. As he cut across the stage, bouncing and skipping in a pair of red sneakers, Mercer\\u2019s sudden starts and stops were compellingly unpredictable; with turned-out feet and an invisible horse between his legs, he cut a spooky prancing path through the center of the stage. But shortly after he abandoned his movement meditation for a singing-spoken segment, the piece was over. It had the feel of a study.\", \"While Mercer made use of a balcony at the back of the theater \\u2014 and disappeared through a door where a ring light hung \\u2014 the space seemed to be arranged mainly for Petronio\\u2019s excavation of what he calls in the program notes, \\u201cshort form works that I consider golden keys to viewing the larger works that they were attached to.\\u201d\", \"At times, the echoes were palpable. In \\u201cNo More Heroes,\\u201d to the punk band the Stranglers, Nicholas Sciscione, wearing a billowy, transparent white top and shimmery shorts by Manolo, etched the stage with a phantom feeling of the complete dance \\u2014 Petronio\\u2019s \\u201cLareigne\\u201d (1995) \\u2014 in his prickly and frenzied airborne solo. With his hair in pigtails, Ryan Pliss tore across the stage in \\u201cFor Today I Am a Boy,\\u201d set to Anohni (from \\u201cThis is the Story of a Girl in a World,\\u201d 2008); angular in one moment and wilted in the next, Pliss demonstrated masterful control. And Jaqlin Medlock, in \\u201cPre-Weep\\u201d set to to Nick Cave (from \\u201cUnderland,\\u201d 2011), showed off her ever-rippling arms with luscious abandon.\", \"But presented back to back, with the performers changing costumes off to the side, the works seemed more like fragments of dances than complete works; they could also nod too closely to the lyrics. The costume that Mac Twining wore in \\u201cSleeping Pills,\\u201d to the London Suede (from \\u201cDrawn That Way,\\u201d 1996), featured an oversized pill capsule strapped to his back. And when an Elvis Presley recording of \\u201cAre You Lonesome Tonight,\\u201d a recent video work transferred to the stage, was followed up with \\u201cLove Me Tender\\u201d (from \\u201cThe King Is Dead,\\u201d 1993), it felt like a fall down a YouTube rabbit hole.\", \"Petronio\\u2019s choice of songs \\u2014 \\u201chuman markers from pop culture,\\u201d he calls them \\u2014 are full of emotion; in some ways, the soundtrack also seems to also pine for the glory days of the East Village with its, he writes, \\u201cfierce street fashion and poetry that screams into the void.\\u201d Then, nightclubs were performance spaces ripe for experimentation; here, a machine filled the stage with hazy smoke. But even at La MaMa, an East Village institution and survivor of gentrification, it felt forced, more like a nostalgic whisper than a fierce, ferocious scream.\"]","href_hash":"a338a6be495a11ec97056760ccdd4923"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a338a6be495a11ec97056760ccdd4923"}},
