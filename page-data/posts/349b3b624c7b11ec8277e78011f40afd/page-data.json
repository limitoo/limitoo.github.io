He has called his character, the superskilled archer Hawkeye, a \\u201cutility guy.\\u201d But what he\\u2019s really been is a punching bag.\", \"In the M.C.U. movies in which Hawkeye (civilian name Clint Barton) has appeared as part of the superhero ensemble \\u2014 toiling in the shadows of Thor and Iron Man and Captain America \\u2014 his luck has not been good. He was magically forced to do a bad guy\\u2019s bidding and had to be knocked cold to break the spell. When the Avengers needed a crash pad, they took over his farm. When he got caught in the line of fire, a promising young hero died protecting him.\", \"And that was before his family vanished, along with half the life in the universe, in \\u201cAvengers: Infinity War.\\u201d That sent him into a tailspin during which he became a vigilante \\u2014 and really, who could blame him? \\u2014 a fall from which he emerged only to have another hero, Black Widow, sacrifice herself for him.\", \"After all that guilt and grief and humiliation, it was nice to hear that Barton, and by extension Renner, was finally getting a title role, even if it was in the second tier of the M.C.U.: a six-episode series on Disney+. But hold on: \\u201cHawkeye,\\u201d which premieres with two episodes Wednesday, has two Hawkeyes. And Clint Barton, even after helping save the world several times over, is not the lead Hawkeye. He\\u2019s playing second fiddle in the show that carries his name.\", \"This wouldn\\u2019t matter much except that Renner has proved, in things like \\u201cThe Bourne Legacy\\u201d and several \\u201cMission: Impossible\\u201d films, that when he\\u2019s not limited to playing dour or flummoxed he can be a superior action star, of the subtle, self-contained variety. He deserves better than Marvel and Disney, with their industrial approach to casting, have given him.\", \"There is a morsel of good news, though, based on Disney+\\u2019s usual scant allowance of episodes for review (two). \\u201cHawkeye\\u201d does give Renner a little more range, and while doting father and crusty mentor aren\\u2019t necessarily what we\\u2019re looking for, they\\u2019ll have to do, at least until the action picks up, as it presumably will in later episodes. In the meantime he graciously and skillfully assumes the role of straight man to the show\\u2019s real protagonist, Hailee Steinfeld. She plays a Gen Z Hawkeye stan who has taught herself archery and martial arts but needs guidance when it comes to crime-fighting and general superhero comportment.\", \"In the kind of narrative spackling that holds the M.C.U. together, we learn that Steinfeld\\u2019s character, Kate Bishop, was a young girl when the Battle of New York (way back in \\u201cThe Avengers\\u201d) took place right outside her family\\u2019s luxurious Manhattan apartment. That\\u2019s where her Hawkeye fixation starts; now she\\u2019s a college student playing pranks with trick arrows and trailing the suspicious new boyfriend (Tony Dalton of \\u201cBetter Call Saul\\u201d) of her widowed mother (Vera Farmiga).\", \"There\\u2019s also some backfilling of Barton\\u2019s story line: During his vigilante phase, he assumed the persona Ronin and did brutal battle with New York\\u2019s criminal gangs. Now that his family is back (restored along with everyone else in \\u201cAvengers: Endgame\\u201d), he\\u2019s trying to do the normal-life thing and enjoy Christmas in the city. But as fate and screenwriting would have it, he finds himself tangled up with his biggest fan and some angry gangsters.\", \"As developed by Jonathan Igla, a writer and producer whose credits include \\u201cMad Men\\u201d and \\u201cBridgerton,\\u201d \\u201cHawkeye\\u201d in these early episodes is a light and pleasant watch, one that seems less concerned with Marvel pieties or high-concept games than with straightforward buddy comedy. Steinfeld and Renner are good foils for each other, as Bishop pushes Barton to relax and he tends to her like a fussy aunt. Her initial puppy-dog enthusiasm (\\u201cAre you assessing threats? Is that what you\\u2019re doing?\\u201d) is quickly tempered by superhero reality, such as when getting supplies means hitting CVS for Neosporin and rubbing alcohol.\", \"Igla, and Renner, also make good sport of the inflated seriousness and overheated commercialism that can characterize the Marvel brand. The vacationing Barton family watches in horror as a frenetic Broadway cast powers through \\u201cRogers: The Musical.\\u201d (The familiar-looking hoofer singing the praises of Captain America is the \\u201cRent\\u201d star Adam Pascal.) Tracking down a lead, Barton finds himself amid a group of broad-sword-fighting role players; to get what he\\u2019s after, he has to not only join in but also agree to take a fall so that one of the LARPers can say he defeated an Avenger.\", \"It\\u2019s a modest but promising start, and it seems likely enough that the show can carry its low-key comic energy through four more episodes. It\\u2019s less clear whether that will be enough time to wrap up a satisfying story. Two presumably prominent cast members \\u2014 Florence Pugh, as Yelena Belova (the surviving Black Widow), and Alaqua Cox, as the deaf hero Echo \\u2014 are barely present yet, and they will have to be shoehorned into the action. Here\\u2019s hoping there\\u2019s still room for Renner to have fun.\"]","href_hash":"349b3b624c7b11ec8277e78011f40afd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"349b3b624c7b11ec8277e78011f40afd"}},
