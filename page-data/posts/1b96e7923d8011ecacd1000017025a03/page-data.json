They acknowledge Cudi for reshaping hip-hop on his own terms.\", \"But the director Robert Alexander\\u2019s documentary doesn\\u2019t only remind you that the artist (whose real name is Scott Mescudi) revolutionized the genre, softening its conventional definition of masculinity by simply being himself. The film additionally presents a moving rumination on art and individuality, and the invaluable connection between both.\", \"Through the biographical self-reflective framework of the doc, Alexander leads the viewer to examine art from a psychological and representational perspective. The significance of Black visibility in the arts is a prominent thread, and watching Willow Smith dance like no one is watching to one of her favorite Cudi songs, \\u201cSky Might Fall,\\u201d expresses Cudi\\u2019s profound influence on the youth who were led by him in their own dismantling of social constructs.\", \"More broadly, this is a film about the music that makes us, but Alexander poses a fundamental concern as he explores that topic: What toll does the development of this work take on its creator?\", \"Cudi opens up about his struggles.
