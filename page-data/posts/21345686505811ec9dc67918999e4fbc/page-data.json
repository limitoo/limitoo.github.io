The N.B.A. might blunder into a humbling political crisis based on a single tweet, and rich contracts might vanish into thin air overnight, but China, the thinking went, was a potential gold mine. And for that reason leagues, teams, governing bodies and athletes contorted themselves for any chance to tap into it.\", \"But recent events may have changed that thinking for good, and raised a new question: Is doing business in China still worth it?\", \"The sports world received a hint last week of a changing dynamic when the WTA \\u2014 one of many organizations that have worked aggressively over the last decade to establish a foothold in the Chinese market \\u2014 threatened to stop doing business there altogether if the government failed to confirm the safety of Peng Shuai. Peng, a top women\\u2019s tennis player once hailed by state media as \\u201cour Chinese princess,\\u201d disappeared from public life recently after accusing a prominent former government official of sexual assault.\", \"The WTA\\u2019s threat was remarkable not only for its reasoning, but for its rarity.\", \"But as China\\u2019s top leader, Xi Jinping, governs through an increasingly authoritarian approach, and as its record on human rights has made the country, and those who do business there, a growing target for a chorus of critics and activists, sports leagues and organizations may soon be forced to re-evaluate their longstanding assumptions.\", \"That sort of direct confrontation is already taking place elsewhere: Lawmakers in the European Union recently called for stronger ties with Taiwan, an island China claims as its territory, only months after European officials blocked a landmark commercial agreement over human rights concerns and labeled China a \\u201ctotalitarian threat.\\u201d\", \"For most sports organizations, the WTA\\u2019s position remains an outlier. Sports organizations with multimillion-dollar partnerships in China \\u2014 whether the N.B.A., England\\u2019s Premier League, Formula 1 auto racing or the International Olympic Committee \\u2014 have mostly brushed aside concerns.\", \"Some partners have acquiesced at times to China\\u2019s various demands. A few have issued humbling apologies. The I.O.C., in perhaps the most notable example, has seemed to go out of its way to avoid angering China, even as Peng, a three-time Olympian, went missing.\", \"But an evolving public opinion may get harder for sports organizations to ignore. A report this year from the Pew Research Center, for instance, found that 67 percent of Americans had negative feelings toward China, up from 46 percent in 2018. Similar shifts have occurred in other Western democracies.\", \"Mark Dreyer, a sports analyst for China Sports Insider, based in Beijing, said the WTA\\u2019s standoff with China represented an escalation in the \\u201cthem or us\\u201d mentality that appeared to be forming between China and its Western rivals.\", \"The threat from the WTA, then, could serve as a sign of showdowns to come, in which case, Dreyer said, China could lose out.\", \"\\u201cFrankly, China is a big market, but the rest of the world is still bigger,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd if people have to choose, they\\u2019re not going to choose China.\\u201d\", \"To some experts, then, the WTA\\u2019s extraordinary decision to confront China head-on might actually signal a turning point rather than an aberration.\", \"\\u201cThe calculation is one part political, one part moral, one part economic,\\u201d said Simon Chadwick, a professor of international sports business at Emlyon Business School in Lyon, France. He said that the WTA\\u2019s dispute with China reflected the \\u201cred line\\u201d growing between the country and many of its Western counterparts, with the sides seeming more entrenched in diverging sociopolitical ideologies.\", \"\\u201cI think we are rapidly heading toward the kind of terrain where organizations, businesses, and sponsors will be forced to choose one side or another,\\u201d Chadwick added.\", \"The WTA\\u2019s own about-face was stark. Only three years ago, the organization was heralding a deal that made Shenzhen, China, the new home of its tour finals for a decade starting in 2019, accepting promises of a new stadium and a whopping $14 million annual prize pool. In 2019, just before the pandemic, the WTA held nine tournaments in China.\", \"Fast forward to last week, when Steve Simon, the WTA\\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview with The New York Times that if China did not agree to an independent inquiry of Peng\\u2019s claims, that the tour would be willing to cease operations in the country.\", \"\\u201cThere are too many decisions being made today that aren\\u2019t based on what is simply right and wrong,\\u201d Simon said. \\u201cAnd this is the right thing to do, 100 percent.\\u201d\", \"The language raised eyebrows around the sports world.\", \"\\u201cThey are not the first ones to have had a run-in with China,\\u201d Zhe Ji, the director of Red Lantern, a sports marketing company that does work in China, said about the WTA. \\u201cBut I haven\\u2019t seen anybody else come out with as strong a wording as that.\\u201d\", \"The run-ins have proliferated in only the last few years.\", \"The N.B.A., for instance, was seen as a pioneer when it played its first games in China in 2004, including a game featuring Yao Ming, the Chinese star for the Houston Rockets. The ensuing years brought prosperity for the league there, and relative peace. It was praised for its patient, culturally sensitive approach to building there. Then, in 2019, Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets at the time, tweeted in support of pro-democracy protests taking place in Hong Kong, and in the blink of an eye a relationship that had developed over several years imploded.\", \"Merchandise for the Rockets \\u2014 China\\u2019s favorite team in China\\u2019s favorite sports league \\u2014 was removed from stores, and the team\\u2019s games were no longer broadcast on television. Fans took to Chinese social media to attack the league. Then, when the N.B.A. issued what was widely taken as an apology, it sparked an almost equally robust wave of criticism back home.\", \"\\u201cThe NBA should have anticipated the challenges of doing business in a country run by a repressive single party government, including by being prepared to stand in strong defense of the freedom of expression of its employees, players, and affiliates across the globe,\\u201d read a letter sent to the league by a bipartisan group of United States lawmakers.\", \"The letter\\u2019s signees \\u2014 a cross-party group that included Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a Democrat, and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican \\u2014 accused the N.B.A. of compromising American values and effectively supporting Chinese propaganda.\", \"\\u201cThe N.B.A. has adhered to its values by supporting Daryl Morey\\u2019s and others\\u2019 rights to express their views despite the significant impact to our business,\\u201d Mike Bass, an N.B.A. spokesman, said on Wednesday.\", \"Ultimately, the affair showed how even the most conscientious organizations could find their plans undermined by Chinese politics, how any business could unwillingly become a vessel for an international spat.\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re angering both sides, it means there is no middle ground, which I think was significant,\\u201d said Dreyer, the Beijing-based sports analyst.\", \"Like other observers, Dreyer suggested the WTA\\u2019s stance was potentially game-changing. But he noted, too, that it was possibly easier for the WTA to defy China than it had been for, say, the N.B.A., for two reasons.\", \"First, because the pandemic had already forced the WTA to cancel its events in China for the near future, the tour was not necessarily forfeiting big sums of money in the immediate term. (Severing ties with China permanently would of course require the WTA Tour to replace tens of millions of dollars in revenue and prize money.) Second, because China has essentially erased any mention of Peng and the ensuing international outcry from its news and social media, the WTA\\u2019s brand may not take much of a hit there. Many in China simply do not know about Peng, or the WTA\\u2019s response.\", \"\\u201cWith the N.B.A., they were burning jerseys,\\u201d Dreyer said. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have that reaction against tennis.\\u201d\", \"To be sure, big sports leagues that have deep, longstanding interests in China, barring some extreme turn of events, will not exit the market any time soon. And some organizations are still going all-in.\", \"The I.O.C., which will stage the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing in February, has tuned out any and all calls from critics for the organization to make some statement about China\\u2019s human rights abuses, including the treatment of religious minorities in the country\\u2019s western regions.\", \"Formula 1 this month announced that it had signed a deal to continue the Chinese Grand Prix, an annual race in Shanghai, through 2025, and the Premier League appears to have patched over a crisis that began when a top player infuriated China by criticizing its human rights record.\", \"Some in the industry, though, have already noticed a change, a slight cooling, among other companies pondering business in the sports market there.\", \"\\u201cWith increased political tension and the complications of doing business in China, I\\u2019ve seen more companies focus back on Europe and the U.S., where the reward may not be as large but the risk is much less,\\u201d said Lisa Delpy Neirotti, an international sports marketing consultant and director of the sports management master\\u2019s program at George Washington University.\", \"That dynamic has been vivid in European soccer, which had collectively seemed to view China as a sort of El Dorado five years ago, but now seems to be coming to terms with reality after a series of disappointments. In Italy, Inter Milan, one of that country\\u2019s most storied clubs, is in a tailspin after its Chinese owner, Suning, a consumer goods company, became engulfed in a major financial crisis. The team has been forced to sell player contracts to meet its payroll.\", \"In England, the Premier League remains in litigation with a broadcast partner that failed to pay up after signing a record-breaking television deal to broadcast games in China. A new partner is paying a fraction of the previous agreement, leaving some clubs disillusioned.\", \"\\u201cOver the last five years there had been a perception in the West that China is there for the taking \\u2014 there\\u2019s lots of money, economic growth is strong, a growing middle class, disposal income, and we can go feast on this,\\u201d Chadwick said. \\u201cWhat has happened for some sports organizations in the West is that they have not found China as lucrative as they imagined, and they have also found China incredibly difficult to do business with.\\u201d\", \"The difficulties appear to be deepening.\", \"Half a decade ago, the Chinese government, emboldened about sports after hosting the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, announced plans to create an $800 billion domestic sports industry, the largest in the world. That captured the attention of Western sports organizations.\", \"What many organizations did not anticipate, though, were the peculiarities of the Chinese business landscape, the extent to which politics is woven through all aspects of China\\u2019s economy, and the increasing nationalism under Xi.\", \"\\u201cI absolutely think over the long term that major sporting events will be hesitant moving forward to schedule out in China right now,\\u201d said Thomas A. Baker III, a sports management professor at the University of Georgia who has done extensive work in China. \\u201cThe China that welcomed the world in 2008 is not the same China that people are doing business with in 2021.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"21345686505811ec9dc67918999e4fbc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"21345686505811ec9dc67918999e4fbc"}},
