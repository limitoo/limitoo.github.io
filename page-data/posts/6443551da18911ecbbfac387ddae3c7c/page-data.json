It's really important if players are going to be accountable for their selection that they get as many points of reference on their game that they can.\\\"\", \"Fuller said players needed to be more deliberate about what they were setting up on both attack and defence.\", \"\\\"It's a really important piece of international netball that gets overlooked when you're not pushed every week.\\\"\", \"Fuller said it came down to fitness and awareness.\", \"\\\"We do have levels of fitness that match and probably also outwork international opposition but it's actually understanding strategies that can make a team play out of position, make the space look crowded and so I'm hoping that will become very much part of ANZ game play.\\\"\", \"Yvonne Willering told the Kiwi Netball Show a lot of hope was also resting on the return of former Silver Ferns' captain Ameliaranne Ekenasio, who's coming back from having a baby.\", \"\\\"On and off the court she is needed in the team.
