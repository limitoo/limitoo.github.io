in Katherine remains stubbornly slow.\", \"Katherine and the remote community of Robinson River have been in lockdown since Monday following the discovery of a growing coronavirus cluster.\", \"So far, 19 Aboriginal Territorians have tested positive to the virus, with concerns those numbers could rise as more test results are returned.\", \"But the outbreak has also coincided with an increase in another critical statistic.\", \"\\\"We've had an enormous uptick in our vaccination rates,\\\" NT Chief Health Officer, Dr Charles Pain, said.\", \"The NT government yesterday said 96 per cent of Territorians have now received their first dose, while 83 per cent are fully vaccinated.\", \"The latest data followed a day in which 2,244 people received a jab \\u2014 the third highest day on record.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Fear'\\u00a0factor leading to vaccinations</div>\", \"Chief Minister Michael Gunner said the current outbreak, like others before it, had\\u00a0proven a motivating factor for people to protect themselves.\", \"\\\"When we have had fear in the community, people have got vaccinated,\\\" Mr Gunner said.\", \"\\\"Or when there has been a distinct, direct advantage to being vaccinated, like the lockout scenario where you can live your normal life, there has been a spike for vaccination.\\\"\", \"Mr Gunner praised the response in Robinson River, where the first dose vaccination rate among eligible residents was yesterday expected to reach 100 per cent.\", \"In Central Australia, he said four remote communities \\u2014Watarrka, Wallace Rockhole, Nyirripi and Ikuntji \\u2014 had risen above the 70 per cent threshold for first doses.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c939bcef477e4b65ac70461e0cb47e7a\\\"

the Aboriginal population to get vaccinated \\u2013 do not wait.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Low dose numbers in Katherine</div>\", \"In Katherine, the NT government said the first dose rate was 82 per cent, with 75 per cent of residents fully vaccinated.\", \"But on Wednesday, just 95 doses were administered in the town.\", \"The Chief Minister suggested the low figures could be the result of residents prioritising the need to get tested for COVID-19, with almost 700 tests conducted on Wednesday.\", \"NT Police Commissioner Jamie Chalker said authorities were also trying to make it easier for people in Katherine to get to vaccination hubs.\", \"\\\"We have had some anecdotal feedback that transport was a problem,\\\" he said.\", \"Katherine resident Lynette Hoffman, who has already received her first dose of the vaccine, urged others to do the same.\", \"\\\"Do not be afraid and please get that shot,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"I am going for my second one on Friday and if I can do it, you can do it too.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/86233888daff7549e25309e965da8c96\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Takeup of the

\"The chief executive\\u00a0of the Anyinginyi Health Aboriginal Corporation in Tennant Creek, Barb Shaw, said she had noticed only a slight uptake in vaccination rates since the outbreak.\", \"\\\"We are seeing motivation in the community for the jab, but not as a major surge,\\\" Ms Shaw said.\", \"The latest Commonwealth data for the Barkly region, which includes Tennant Creek, shows 49 per cent of people have received one dose, with 36 per cent fully vaccinated.\", \"\\\"We have yet to crunch the numbers to see the difference since the outbreak, but it would be minimal,\\\" Ms Shaw said.\",

we're doing, and what you have done up to now, there is some chance we will come through this with a number of positives.\", \"\\\"One is higher vaccination rates \\u2014 vaccination rates that will
