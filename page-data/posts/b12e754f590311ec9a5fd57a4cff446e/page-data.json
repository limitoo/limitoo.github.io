It topped out at 50 percent in August and had fallen back to 48 percent by October.\", \"Abbott's approval rating in October was 43 percent, according to the Texas Politics Project.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Texans' Views on the Power Grid</div>\", \"Separately, an October YouGov poll conducted for the University of Texas-Austin and The Texas Tribune found that 60 percent of respondents disapproved of how state leaders and the legislature had handled the reliability of the power grid.\", \"That was the highest level of disapproval on any issue polled in the survey, followed by abortion policy at 46 percent.\", \"In February, freezing temperatures and significantly increased demand for power led the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to order power transmission utilities to cut power to homes and businesses in order to avoid a general collapse of the grid.\", \"However, in some cases this led to the electricity going to power plants being cut, exacerbating the problem.\", \"Abbott moved this year to require the weatherization of the Texas power grid in an effort to prevent a repeat of the February outages, signing almost a dozen laws to do so.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Keeping the Lights on</div>\", \"Abbot also promised things would run more smoothly this winter in an interview on November 26\", \"\\\"I can guarantee the lights will stay on,\\\" Abbott told Fox 7 Austin.\", \"On Wednesday, Texas energy officials also moved to reassure the public about the energy supply. The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) regulates electrical utilities and oversees ERCOT.\", \"PUC Chair Peter Lake addressed the mandatory winterization of power plants and transmission equipment at a press conference, saying: \\\"The ERCOT grid is stronger and more reliable than ever.\\\"\", \"\\\"We are going into the winter knowing that the lights will stay on,\\\" Lake said.\", \"Brad Jones, interim CEO of ERCOT, reported that 97 percent of Texas' 855 power generators had submitted the required readiness reports by the December 1 deadline. There will also be inspections at more than 300 facilities this month to make sure the necessary upgrades have been carried out.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Potential Vulnerabilities</div>\", \"However, the grid may still have its vulnerabilities. Natural gas facilities are not required to weatherize their equipment at this time and may not do so until at least next winter.\", \"The Railroad Commission of Texas, which regulates the state's oil and gas industry, is expected to create rules for weatherization after a committee maps the state's gas infrastructure by September 2022.\", \"O'Rourke addressed that issue in an interview with KENS 5 published on Wednesday.\", \"\\\"If you do not weatherize the gas supply, it's like having a new truck without any gasoline in the tank,\\\" O'Rourke said.\", \"He said that if he's elected governor, he would require natural gas companies to weatherize equipment.\", \"\\\"Ensure that the lights are on, the heat is running and the water is flowing,\\\" O'Rourke said. \\\"That's the least that you should be able to expect from your government. But even on that most basic level, the State of Texas Governor Abbott failed the people in February. We cannot let that happen again.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">ERCOT's Role</div>\", \"During his November 26 interview, Abbott said: \\\"I have talked to some of the natural gas pipeline transmitters, and they've also have been doing winterization that most people don't know about.\\\"\", \"\\\"Most importantly is the approach ERCOT has taken this year, unlike last year,\\\" the governor said. \\\"Last year they were reactive, and waited until a crisis mode before they summoned more power, more energy, now the way ERCOT works, is they work days in advance in summoning that power to make sure they will have enough power to keep the lights on.\\\"\", \"ERCOT's own assessment also highlights three potential high risk scenarios where there may not be enough power to meet demand. Those scenarios may not play out, however.\", \"This coming winter may be a real test for the Texas power grid and that could have serious political implications.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948347/photo-composite-shows-abbott-orourke.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A composite photo shows Texas Governor Gregg Abbott and former Democratic Representative Beto O'Rourke.
