He added: \\u201cI don\\u2019t see that type of trend going forward for me. It\\u2019s going to have to be a different way. I\\u2019m at peace with that. I\\u2019ve made the climb enough times.\\u201d\", \"In that moment, one of the most influential athletes of the last quarter-century retreated from the brightest spotlight in sports. Woods said he hoped to play competitive golf again at some level, although he offered no timetable for achieving that ambition. Instead, a sporting champion best known for willing himself to victories conceded that his surgically rebuilt right leg would forever inhibit his once-lofty expectations and drive.\", \"\\u201cA full practice schedule and the recovery that it would take to do that,\\u201d he said, \\u201cno, I don\\u2019t have any desire to do that.\\u201d\", \"It was a striking concession for the tenacious Woods, and an inflection point for golf and sports in general. Woods has been among the world\\u2019s most prominent people since he won the first of his 15 major golf championships in 1997, with a likeness recognized around the globe and omnipresent commercial endorsements.\", \"Yet, for all his triumphs and attendant fame, the February crash and its debilitating consequences were in keeping with a recurring cycle of fortune and misfortune \\u2014 all of Woods\\u2019s own making \\u2014 that will forever mark the narrative of his life.\", \"At the height of his fame, in 2009, when he seemed destined to easily surpass Jack Nicklaus\\u2019s record of 18 major golf championships \\u2014 Woods already had 14 \\u2014 news reports about serial infidelity cost him his marriage, and he was shunned by many in the golf community. His myriad corporate sponsors dropped him. The scandal caused him to take a lengthy hiatus from golf.\", \"When Woods returned to competition, he struggled to find his old form, in part because of physical ailments linked to the obsessive, perhaps overly aggressive workout regimen that had been his hallmark. Worse for Woods, on the same golf courses where he had been greeted by wild cheering, he was instead met with an eerie quiet that bordered on disdain.\", \"In time, he became a limping afterthought as a young wave of golfers replaced him atop leaderboards. Woods\\u2019s descent led to a defining act: a middle-of-the-night arrest in May 2017 that revealed an opioid addiction. The police took Woods into custody after he was found alone and asleep in his car on the side of a road with the engine running.\", \"In keeping with his career arc, Woods\\u2019s resurrection was dramatic and irresistible.\", \"At the 2019 Masters, he was not considered a serious contender. Yet as he played the last holes of the final round on the hallowed grounds of Augusta National Golf Club, Woods was rejuvenated. He played his best golf while his younger rivals wilted, birdieing three of the final six holes to claim his fifth Masters title. When he sank the winning putt on the 18th hole, Woods celebrated with a primal scream that seemed to be matched by the thousands of fans encircling the green.\", \"Two years earlier, Woods had ranked as low as 1,119th in the world. His comeback, given his off-the-course hardships, is among the greatest in sports history.\", \"While Woods continued to be competitive in 2019, and won one more event, the pandemic forced an extended absence from golf. In January this year, he underwent a fifth back operation that sidelined him. He hoped to return by April.\", \"On Feb. 23, police determined that Woods was driving about 85 m.p.h. in a 45 m.p.h. zone on the winding Southern California road when he lost control of his SUV. Woods sustained open fractures, in several places, of the tibia and the fibula in his right leg.\", \"On Tuesday, speaking ahead of the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas, a tournament that benefits Woods\\u2019s foundation, he briefly discussed the crash and its aftermath, which included the possibility that his right leg would have to be amputated.\", \"\\u201cI feel I\\u2019m lucky to be alive but still have the limb \\u2014 those are two crucial things,\\u201d Woods, 45, said. \\u201cSo I\\u2019m very, very grateful that someone upstairs was able to take care of me and I\\u2019m able to not only be here, but also walking with a prosthesis.\\u201d\", \"When asked what he remembered about the crash, Woods said: \\u201cYeah, all those answers have been answered in the investigation. So you can read about all that there in the police report.\\u201d\", \"In an investigation affidavit, Woods repeatedly said he didn\\u2019t remember how the crash occurred. He was not charged with any legal violation. Asked if he had flashbacks or recent memory of the incident, Woods replied: \\u201cI don\\u2019t. I\\u2019m very lucky in that way.\\u201d\", \"Woods said he purposely did not watch news accounts about his crash while he was hospitalized.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t want to have my mind go there,\\u201d Woods said, adding that he was in considerable pain, even when medicated. Asked if he was still in pain, he grinned and nodded.\", \"\\u201cYep, my back hurts, my leg hurts,\\u201d Woods said.\", \"Woods appeared most comfortable when discussing what he can and cannot currently do on the golf course. He has begun playing some holes, but he said his swing lacks speed and power, noting that many of his shots \\u201cfall out of the sky\\u201d much sooner than they once did.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s eye-opening,\\u201d Woods said and offered giggling support to a United States Golf Association initiative that encourages golfers to play from tees that can significantly shorten the length of courses. \\u201cI really like that idea.\\u201d\", \"The comment reflected the arduous path Woods will have to negotiate to return to the elite level of golf necessary to play on the PGA Tour.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve got to prove to myself that I\\u2019m good enough,\\u201d he said of that effort. Referring to PGA Tour pros, Woods quipped: \\u201cI\\u2019ll chip and putt with any of these guys, but courses are longer than chip-and-putt courses. I\\u2019m not going to be playing the par-3 course at Augusta to win the Masters. You need a bigger game than that.\\u201d\", \"But Woods, who talked about how the muscles and nerves in his right leg needed to continue to rehabilitate, was nonetheless optimistic that, in time, he could possibly improve his game enough to sporadically play tour events again.\", \"\\u201cTo ramp up for a few tournaments a year, there\\u2019s no reason I can\\u2019t do that and feel ready,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve come off long layoffs and I\\u2019ve won or come close to winning. I know the recipe.\\u201d\", \"He cautioned, though, that he was not close to that level of golf yet.\", \"\\u201cI have a long way to go to get to that point,\\u201d Woods said. \\u201cI haven\\u2019t decided whether or not I want to get to that point.\\u201d\", \"At roughly the midpoint of the news conference, Woods was asked if he wanted to play in next year\\u2019s British Open, on the 150th anniversary of the event. It will be held at St. Andrews, the birthplace of golf.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019d love to play at St. Andrews, my favorite golf course in the world, and being a two-time Open champion there,\\u201d he said.\", \"But Woods\\u2019s next sentence was perhaps most telling. He changed the subject to whether he would be able to attend the pre-competition ceremonial dinner for past British Open champions.\", \"\\u201cI would like, you know, just even being a part of the champions dinner is really neat,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThose dinners are priceless. It\\u2019s an honor to be part of a room like that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"92ca91ce523411ecb4d22d4eed0ea718"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"92ca91ce523411ecb4d22d4eed0ea718"}},
