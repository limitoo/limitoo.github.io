The Russians have launched more than 625 missiles in the 11 days of fighting, the official said, and appear to be increasing their use of long-range strikes to supplement or make up for the lack of ground movement and lack of air superiority.\", \"Some allied military leaders are likewise indicating that Ukrainian forces and civilians might be able to withstand the Russians' advances.\", \"\\\"I think we've seen a Russian invasion that is not going well. I think we're also seeing a remarkable resistance by Ukraine, both its armed forces and its people,\\\" Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the chief of the defense staff in the U.K., told BBC News on Sunday. \\\"We do know that some of the lead elements of Russian forces have been decimated by the Ukrainian response.\\\"\", \"Hodges, the retired U.S. commander, said that Putin's adopted tactics could start to increase pressure on the Russian leader not only from other countries, but from within his own.\", \"\\\"The great unknown for me is if the Russian population will continue to support this once they understand what's really going on,\\\" Hodges said. \\\"And I'm sure they'll begin to understand it soon, despite Putin's blackout on news/social media.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"David Reiter and Eleanor Watson contributed reporting.\", \"Tucker Reals is the CBSNews.com foreign editor, based at the CBS News London bureau.\"]","href_hash":"51870fe49e4c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"51870fe49e4c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
