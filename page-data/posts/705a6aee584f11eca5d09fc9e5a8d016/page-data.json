New York\\u2019s Drama Book Shop sold out the first volume of his collected lyrics. And close to 5,000 people have been entering a lottery to win tickets to weekend performances for a sold-out run of \\u201cAssassins.\\u201d\", \"In the days since the unexpected death of one of the most important writers in the history of musical theater, interest in his work has surged.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s even greater demand to see the work of Sondheim, and we\\u2019ve been feeling the benefit,\\u201d said Chris Harper, a lead producer of the revival of \\u201cCompany,\\u201d one of Sondheim\\u2019s most acclaimed musicals, which opens on Broadway on Thursday. \\u201cWhat has also been pretty extraordinary to watch is that audiences are listening much more intently, and it feels like a much richer and deeper experience.\\u201d\", \"Sondheim died, unexpectedly, on Nov. 26, at the age of 91; the cause of death was cardiovascular disease, according to his death certificate. Broadway theaters decided to dim their lights Wednesday night for one minute in his honor.\", \"Sondheim\\u2019s popularity had its peaks and valleys during his lifetime, and many of his shows were not commercially successful. But much of his work is now frequently performed, and his importance to the art form is undisputed; on Sunday he was hailed by President Biden, who said, \\u201cStephen was in a class of his own as a composer and a lyricist.\\u201d\", \"The evidence of a spike in appetite for work by Sondheim is everywhere.\", \"Look, for example, to the Off Broadway revival of \\u201cAssassins,\\u201d directed by John Doyle and now running at the Classic Stage Company in Lower Manhattan. The production was fully sold out before Sondheim\\u2019s death, but now the number of people regularly entering a digital lottery hoping to score $15 tickets is ballooning. And the roughly 5,000 people seeking tickets to weekend shows face long odds: the theater seats just 196 people.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re definitely seeing an uptick in interest since his passing,\\u201d said Phil Haas, the nonprofit\\u2019s director of marketing and communications. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to judge the exact amount, because the show is sold out and has been sold out for some time, but we have seen increased numbers of people joining our lottery, more people waiting on the cancellation line, and people waiting for longer.\\u201d\", \"Then there is the Drama Book Shop, a specialty store in Midtown that stocks scripts and other theater-related publications. Needless to say, Sondheim was always popular there, but now, even more so.\", \"\\u201cWe almost immediately sold out, and had to reorder, \\u2018Finishing the Hat,\\u2019\\u201d said Pete Milano, who oversees the store\\u2019s operations, referring to the first volume of Sondheim\\u2019s collected lyrics. After Sondheim\\u2019s death, the store assembled much of its Sondheim material for a display near the entrance, and now the second volume of Sondheim\\u2019s lyrics, \\u201cLook, I Made a Hat,\\u201d is selling strongly, as are the texts for the musicals he co-authored.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not just one, but across the board, which was nice to see,\\u201d Milano said. \\u201cPlus, a lot of people are talking about him when they come in.\\u201d\", \"Online, streams of Sondheim\\u2019s music soared 523 percent in the U.S. during the week after his death, according to MRC Data, a tracking service that powers the Billboard charts.\", \"At the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, a new display of Sondheim memorabilia \\u2014 letters he wrote to prominent artists as well as set models and sketches from some of his shows \\u2014 was mounted in response to his death. And on Instagram, a new account called @sondheimletters has sprung up to collect and display letters Sondheim wrote to fans as well as collaborators.\", \"The \\u201cCompany\\u201d opening, for a re-gendered production directed by Marianne Elliott that stars Katrina Lenk and Patti LuPone, is proving to be a hot ticket \\u2014 among those expected to attend are Meryl Streep and Lin-Manuel Miranda.\", \"And there are other productions of Sondheim shows in the works. The Encores! program at New York City Center had already announced it was planning a two-week run of \\u201cInto the Woods\\u201d next May, with public school students and older adults joining Sara Bareilles, Christian Borle, Heather Hedley and Ashley Park in the cast; last week Encores! announced that the production will now be dedicated to Sondheim, who wrote the music and lyrics. \", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve been hearing from some of the performers that are in it, who are weeping as they relisten to his music and prepare for their roles,\\u201d said the Encores! artistic director, Lear deBessonet, who is directing the \\u201cInto the Woods\\u201d production. \\u201cThis is a moment of grace, to celebrate Steve and all he brought to this world.\\u201d\", \"MasterVoices, a New York based chorus, is planning a concert version of the rarely staged \\u201cAnyone Can Whistle\\u201d in March at Carnegie Hall, starring Vanessa Williams. Barrington Stage Company, in the Berkshires, announced Tuesday that it would produce \\u201cA Little Night Music\\u201d next summer, directed by Julianne Boyd in her final season as that theater\\u2019s artistic director.\", \"And New York Theater Workshop, an Off Broadway nonprofit, is close to confirming plans for a production of \\u201cMerrily We Roll Along,\\u201d directed by Maria Friedman, for late next year.\", \"Plus, of course, the Steven Spielberg-directed movie remake of \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d which Sondheim wrote the lyrics for, is already generating awards buzz in advance of its release on Friday. (\\u201cI think it\\u2019s just great,\\u201d Sondheim said of the film in an interview a few days before he died. He added, \\u201cThe great thing about it is people who think they know the musical are going to have surprises.\\u201d)\", \"A film version of \\u201cFollies\\u201d is also in the works; the script is \\u201cin active development,\\u201d according to a spokesman for the production company, Heyday Films.\"]","href_hash":"705a6aee584f11eca5d09fc9e5a8d016"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"705a6aee584f11eca5d09fc9e5a8d016"}},
