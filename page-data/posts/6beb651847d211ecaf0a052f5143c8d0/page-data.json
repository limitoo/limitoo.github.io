He was 79.\", \"The cause was a stroke, his family said.\", \"Mr. Margo had a varied career, performing with the Tokens and its offshoots, producing records and writing for television. But nothing had a bigger impact than the recording he was part of when he was 19: \\u201cThe Lion Sleeps Tonight\\u201d became one of the most recognizable songs in American music, instantly identifiable from Jay Siegel\\u2019s opening falsetto. Mr. Margo sang baritone.\", \"The song had its origins in South Africa, where Solomon Linda and the Original Evening Birds recorded a simple tune they called \\u201cMbube\\u201d \\u2014 Zulu for \\u201cthe lion\\u201d \\u2014 containing the now-familiar melody. In the early 1950s the American folk group the Weavers, whose members included Pete Seeger, began performing it but rendered the word of the title as \\u201cwim-o-weh.\\u201d The Kingston Trio and others picked up on that version.\", \"In 1961 the Tokens were looking for a follow-up to their first record, \\u201cTonight I Fell in Love,\\u201d and Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore, producers at RCA Records, brought in the lyricist George Weiss, who added the English lyrics that begin \\u201cIn the jungle, the mighty jungle.\\u201d\", \"Philip Margo and some of the others in the group didn\\u2019t have a lot of confidence in the resulting recording.\", \"\\u201cWe were embarrassed by it and tried to convince Hugo and Luigi not to release it,\\u201d he said in an interview quoted in \\u201cThe Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits\\u201d by Fred Bronson. \\u201cThey said it would be a big record and it was going out.\\u201d\", \"They were right. It hit No. 1 on the Billboard chart in December 1961, remained there for three weeks and became a cultural touchstone. A whole new generation was introduced to it in 1994 when a version turned up in the Disney movie \\u201cThe Lion King.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cNow that it\\u2019s current, we\\u2019re current,\\u201d Mr. Margo said at the time. \\u201cI am thrilled.\\u201d\", \"Philip Frederick Margo was born on April 1, 1942, in Brooklyn to Leon and Ruth (Becker) Margo. He grew up in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn. In 1959 he returned there from a summer job playing piano in the Catskills and, with his younger brother, began trying doo-wop harmonizing with Mr. Siegel and Hank Medress, seeing what they could do with songs like \\u201cA Teenager in Love,\\u201d a hit at the time for Dion and the Belmonts.\", \"\\u201cWe sounded so good we started writing songs ourselves,\\u201d Mr. Margo told The Spokesman-Review of Spokane, Wash., in 1992. One song they came up with was \\u201cTonight I Fell in Love,\\u201d which they recorded and brought to the small Warwick label, whose owner, Marty Kraft, said they needed a name.\", \"\\u201cWe wanted to call ourselves Those Guys, but that was unheard-of in 1960,\\u201d Mr. Margo said in the Billboard book interview. \\u201cIt had to be \\u2018The Somethings.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"So they took the name from an earlier group Mr. Medress had been in, becoming the Tokens.\", \"The Tokens released a number of other singles over the years, including \\u201cI Hear Trumpets Blow\\u201d (1966), and a string of albums. Collectively the group also produced records for others, including the Chiffons and the Happenings.\", \"Mr. Margo continued to perform with his brother, who died in 2017, and with Mr. Medress, who died in 2007. He settled in Beverly Hills and was a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers. During the 1998 baseball season his version of the Tokens (Mr. Siegel has his own) performed the national anthem in every major league ballpark, and is said to have been the first pop group to have accomplished that feat.\", \"In the 1980s and 1990s Mr. Margo wrote and produced television movies and wrote episodes of shows including the sitcom \\u201cBenson.\\u201d He also managed the career of that show\\u2019s star, Robert Guillaume, for a time.\", \"Mr. Margo is survived by his wife, Abbie S. Margo, whom he married in 1966; two sons, Noah Margo and Joshua Ginsberg-Margo; a daughter, Neely S. Irwin; a sister, Maxine Margo Rubin; and eight grandchildren.\", \"The Margo brothers appeared on \\u201cCBS This Morning\\u201d in 1994, promoting a recently released album called \\u201cOldies Are Now.\\u201d Paula Zahn, one of the show\\u2019s hosts, asked them about \\u201cThe Lion Sleeps Tonight,\\u201d including a question \\u2014 \\u201cHow many ways can you butcher a-wim-o-weh?\\u201d \\u2014 that they needed no prompting to answer.\", \"\\u201cWingle-whop, wingle-whetta, wing-away,\\u201d said Phil.\", \"\\u201cWing-o-wack,\\u201d said Mitch.\", \"\\u201cWing-o-wack,\\u201d agreed Phil.\", \"To which Mitch added, \\u201cAnd then some that we can\\u2019t repeat.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6beb651847d211ecaf0a052f5143c8d0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6beb651847d211ecaf0a052f5143c8d0"}},
