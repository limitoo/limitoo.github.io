But crypto investing has taken a hit - despite being increasingly talked up, the currencies have lost 1.4tn in a couple of months.\", \"Halley said market signals surrounding NFTs and crypto are surrounded with warnings right now.\", \"A recent advert by actor Matt Damon for the Crypto.com exchange trumpets their promise, but is a good example of a red flag.\", \"\\\"When you see people like this promoting things that are completely out of their expertise zone that's always a warning sign from an investment point of view.\\\"\", \"\\\"What I've noticed over the decades is that when certain people or certain companies get involved in certain areas of the market it's what I call a 'leading reverse indicator'.
