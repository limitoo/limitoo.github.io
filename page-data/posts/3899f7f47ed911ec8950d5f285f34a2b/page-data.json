The U.S. response emphasizes Ukraine's sovereignty, while suggesting \\\"potential for progress\\\" in areas like arms control in Europe and ways to increase transparency and stability, Blinken said. The document responds to a list Russia's foreign minister gave the U.S. last week.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"All told, it sets out a serious diplomatic path forward, should Russia choose it,\\\" Blinken said. \\\"... We're open to dialogue. We prefer diplomacy. And we're prepared to move forward where there is the possibility of communication and cooperation, if Russia deescalates its aggression toward Ukraine, stops the inflammatory rhetoric, and approaches discussions about the future security in Europe in a spirit of reciprocity.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"The U.S. response has also been delivered to Congress, Blinken said, adding that he'll be briefing members of Congress on the matter Wednesday afternoon. The document will not be released publicly, the secretary of state said.\\u00a0\", \"Still, it's \\\"not a formal negotiating document,\\\" Blinken said.
