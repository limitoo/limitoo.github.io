I want them to stay open and operate safely,\\\" Bettigole said.\", \"Philadelphia is among a growing number of cities across the U.S., including Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City, requiring people show proof of vaccination to enter various types of businesses and venues.\", \"Kenney, a Democrat, said he visited New York two weeks ago, where dining and other indoor establishments have required vaccine proof since August, and found the requirements easy to navigate.\", \"\\\"I was in New York two weeks ago and it was not an issue at all. Bring your ID and vaccination card and everything went smoothly,\\\" Kenney said. \\\"That's why we're doing this to stop the real serious thing, which would be shutting down.\\\"\", \"New York is also first city in the nation to impose a COVID-19 vaccine mandate on private sector employers. Employers in the Big Apple must require\\u00a0COVID-19\\u00a0vaccinations for their workers under new rules announced last week by Mayor Bill de Blasio. Vaccinations are already required for hospital and nursing home workers, city employees \\u2014 including\\u00a0teachers, police officers and firefighters\\u00a0\\u2014 and recently for employees of private and religious schools.\", \"Philly patrons and employees will have to start showing their vaccination cards January 3 to enter establishments where people eat together indoors, including movie theaters and cafes or bars inside larger establishments like stores or hotels.\", \"Bettigole said for the first two weeks of the mandate, patrons will have the option to show a negative COVID-19 test from the last 24 hours to enter.\", \"But starting January 17, proof of full vaccination for patrons will be needed.\", \"The city mandate allows some extra time for children ages 5-11 and employees to get vaccinated. The city is asking that those groups have a first dose by January 3 and a second dose by February 3.\", \"The requirement does not apply to people who are exempted from vaccination, including children under 5 or people with proven medical or religious exemptions, Bettigole said.\", \"But those with exemptions and children between 2 and 5 years old will be required to present a negative COVID-19 test taken within 24 hours to enter establishments that seat more than 1,000 people covered by the requirement. That includes sports venues, movie theatres, bowling alleys or spaces like museum cafes inside larger venues.\", \"She added that establishments like schools, daycares and others like soup kitchens or shelters that serve vulnerable populations will not require vaccination proof or negative tests.\", \"Bettigole said the mandate will apply to the Wells Fargo Center, home of the Flyers and 76ers, or other indoor sporting venues where people buy food and eat it in their seats. The rules will not change for now at outdoor sporting events, but will apply to indoor areas and businesses inside Lincoln Financial Field, where the Eagles play, and similar venues.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"aa8a7e845cde11ec92ee07c3e4996991"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"aa8a7e845cde11ec92ee07c3e4996991"}},
