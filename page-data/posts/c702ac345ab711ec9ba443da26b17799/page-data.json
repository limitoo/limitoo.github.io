Fat Freddy's Drop - Wairunga\", \"\\\"This hive mind return with an undeniably Freddy's album but with a new depth and soul wrapping up all they've learned, loved and lost along the way. It's a stunner!\\\" - Lisa Paris\", \"It's no surprise that this band features in the RNZ National top albums of 2021. The band, which have been performing for more than 20 years, are a central part of the New Zealand music landscape and one of our most successful international music exports.\", \"Stuck in New Zealand due to Covid-19 restrictions, Fat Freddy's Drop decided a to jam it out on a farm.\", \"They travelled from their hometown of Wellington to Hawke's Bay where they recorded a new album in the bush - and that's where Wairunga was born.\", \"19. King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard - Butterfly 3000 \", \"King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard released their 18th album this year, born out of lockdown last year.\", \"The album celebrates the psychedelic rock the band is known for, including its heavy used of synth programming and midi sequences.\", \"18. Lorde - Solar Power\", \"\\\"It was released at the start of the level four lockdown and it transported me away from the stress of everything. Was also a good reminder of the things we have to look forward to, summer!!\\\" - Katie Scotcher\", \"There was so much anticipation for this album, with people craving a new addition for the last several years.\", \"But many did not expect Lorde's Solar Power. It's not a pop banger's album - with Lorde pleading for her fans to not see her as an icon, or a saviour.\", \"It celebrates nature and authenticity.\", \"Lorde is currently the most streamed artist this decade on Spotify with 1.2 trillion streams.\", \"17. Luke Buda - Buda\", \"Luke Buda is best known as a member of psych-pop band The Phoenix Foundation, but when he's not making music with the band, he's making film soundtracks and working on solo music.\", \"Buda is his first solo album in 12 years and we love it.\", \"His wry humour comes through in a perfect way with song titles like I'm a Bit Out of Shape and Beef and Carrots. It's influenced by the past, with tones from the 60s, 70s and 80s.\", \"And despite being billed as a solo album, Buda employs a range of collaborators including Don McGlashan, Riki Gooch, Joe Lindsay and Toby Laing (Fat Freddy's Drop) and Anita Clarke (Motte).\", \"Several of the songs were also partly written by New Zealand novelist Damien Wilkins.\", \"16. Sheep Dog & Wolf - Two Minds \", \"\\\"A stunning, innovative album by one of Aotearoa's most genius composers. The album so far has been a bit over-looked, but it's freshness and complexity should see it rise as a gold-standard in time\\\" - Lisa Paris\", \"Sheep Dog & Wolf is the performance name of New Zealand-born Daniel McBride. Two Minds is his first full album, which followed his critically acclaimed debut Egospect. The debut album was released in 2013, won awards and was well received internationally.\", \"The new Sheep Dog & Wolf album is a document of a dark time in Daniel's life, however the music comes across in a kind of positive way. This album might act as a beacon guiding others through dark times.\", \"15. Team Dynamite - Respect The Process \", \"Haz Beats, Lucky Lance and Tony TZ went through a lot as a trio to release this album - individually, but as a group too. It took a while to put together, but the wait was worth it.\", \"Haz beats production steps up with more experimental drum grooves, beautiful synths - and the beats and drums are awesome.\", \"Lucky Lance and Tony TZ share relatable rhymes that make you smile and reflect on life.\", \"Guests on the album include Bailey Wiley, Louis Baker and Diggy Dup\\u00e9.\", \"The album artwork is also impressive, with the evocative Glen Jowatt image on the cover.\", \"Fans say this album is Aotearoa hip hop at its finest. The group is nominated for Best Hip Hop Album at this Friday's Aotearoa Music Awards.\", \"14. Billie Eilish - Happier Than Ever \", \"\\\"There are some truly exquisite moments on this album. Her and her brother are frickin geniuses (and I hate that term when it comes to music - but they are). Production is next level. Vocals are perfection. Lyrics spot on\\\" - Paula NicNac Media\", \"She's young, successful and experimental, and makes incredible music with her brother. It's so popular people can't stop talking about it.\", \"13. Robert Plant / Alison Krauss - Raise the Roof\", \"Fourteen years after their first album Raising Sand, Alison Krauss and Robert Plant have collaborated with producer T-Bone Burnett again with a new album Raise the Roof.\", \"They have previously spoken to RNZ about the album.\", \" This audio is not downloadable due to copyright restrictions. \", \"12. Troy Kingi - Black Sea Golden Ladder \", \"\\\"Kaupapa deep\\\" \", \"Troy Kingi's fifth album Black Sea Golden Ladder marks the halfway point for the Tai Tokerau singer's 10/10/10 series. The folk-inspired album sees Troy team up with Delaney Davidson on his most personal record yet.\", \"Black Sea Golden Ladder was written and recorded as part of Troy's Matairangi Mahi Toi artist residency hosted by the Governor-General and Massey University.\", \" This audio is not downloadable due to copyright restrictions. \", \"Delaney taught Troy the art of folk songwriting.\", \"\\\"It was quite confronting like, these songs ended up being about me and it was like me looking in the mirror. It wasn't so much scary, it was just weird,\\\" he says.\", \"11. Anthonie Tonnin - Leave Love Out Of This\", \"\\\"Who else builds worlds into their songs better than Tonno?\\\" - Annabel Keane\", \"Anthonie Tonnon released his latest album Leave Love Out of This yesterday, six years after his previous one Successor. The title track one of the top 20 songs competing in this year's Silver Scroll Awards.\", \"Anthonie says Leave Love Out of This is about being part of the first generation growing up in the economic experiment New Zealand launched into during the 1980s.\", \"\\\"This is a constant theme for me - it's been what I've banged on about through all my albums.\\\"\", \"10. Rob Ruha - Ka Hao: Preservation of Scenery \", \"\\\"I think it's a modern classic - great musicians all round, creating a mix that never gets boring. I could listen to this all day\\\" - Editorial at NZ Musician\", \"After refilling his creative energies with his wh\\u0101nau in Te Kaha, award winning musician Rob Ruha returned this year with a new album Preservation Of Scenery.\", \"Rob realised about two years ago that he needed to pause and focus on writing and being creative. He and his family moved to the coast to Te Kaha.\", \"This album is a sound that Rob has not created before. He calls it \\\"a new sonic expression\\\".\", \"And the sound - R&B and soul, laced with pop overtones - is mixed with words which are hard-hitting, putting topics such as institutional racism and M\\u0101ori history in the spotlight.\", \"The album is produced by Rory Noble, a New Zealand producer Ruha met through SongHubs, a songwriting residency aimed at supercharging creativity in New Zealand.\", \"9. French For Rabbits - The Overflow \", \"\\\"Just gunna say it - the next Reb Fountain. Brooke Singer has leaped up on this record with a supremely full flavour, excellently balanced smorgasbord of songs. Listen to it - its undeniable! AND I can't not include Miles Calder - Autopilot Life - sounds like an instant classic - so, so good!\\\" - Lisa Paris\", \"New Zealand dream pop luminaries French for Rabbit's new album The Overflow elevates the band's music to new heights.\", \"The group, led by Brooke Singer, weaves dark and anthemic tunes around folk-pop hooks, with layers of detail that make for an absorbing listen.\", \"Brooke says: \\\"The creation of our third album was very creatively freeing and intuitive. I really love what we've made. It's my favourite record of ours. I think we found a middle ground between the complexity and nuance we love, and some more immediately accessible, big honest feelings.\\\"\", \"The Overflow was recorded by Jol Mulholland (Delaney Davidson, Neil Finn, Troy Kingi) at the The Lab in Auckland and The Surgery in Wellington, and produced by Brooke Singer, Jol Mulholland and French for Rabbits.\", \"8. Ladyhawke - Time Flies\", \"\\\"Ladyhawke is back in a major way. This is electro cool indie pop at its absolute best. Such a vibe and showcases why she is one of NZ's best artists\\\" - Paula NicNak\", \"7. Silk Sonic - An Evening With Silk Sonic\", \"\\\"Pure nostalgia. It's weird because it's more nostalgic of my mum's generation but I guess because she would listen to it when I was a kid, I get that same satisfaction of hearing 'real music'\\\" - Kings Official\", \"Silk Sonic is the musical project of two already very successful musicians - Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak\", \"6. Dry Cleaning - New Long Leg\", \"\\\"I love the dry monotone of Florence Shaw, that talk singing- sprechgesang is so effective. My three favourite tracks on New Long Leg are Scratchcard Lanyard, Strong Feelings and Unsmart Lady. I'm also a sucker for a South London accent and nonsensical lyrics\\\" - Maggie Tweedy\", \"Many people say rock music is dead, but lots of awesome rock bands have been releasing new music this year, including Wet Leg; Billy Nomates; Parquet Courts; Black Country; Nick Cave and The War On Drugs.\", \"One sound that has been coming through is female-led rock bands. Vocalist Florence Shaw speaks and sings over the music in the group's new album.\", \"She is almost droll, monotone, with her South London accent, talking about random things. But somehow it works.\", \"5. Vera Ellen - It's your Birthday\", \"\\\"A perfect taste of Flying Nun era pop rock with a fresh millennial twist. Chocka with punk bangers and sing-a-long BOPS!\\\" - Annabel Keane\", \"Flying Nun Records celebrated their 40th birthday this year, and a new member to their label - Vera Ellen - gave them a true gift with her debut album It's Your Birthday.\", \"Vera Ellen is a wildly prolific songwriter, who you may recognise from LA band Girl Friday (Hardly Art), or grungy New Zealand four-piece Maple Syrup.\", \"Vera Ellen's upcoming Flying Nun debut It's Your Birthday was written over the space of a few years. It chronicles the highs and lows of Vera's early 20s.\", \"It's Your Birthday is not just a gift to the record label - it's a gift for us all.\", \"4. Little Simz - Sometimes I Might Be Introvert\", \"\\\"She takes you on an epic journey, lulls you in with smooth RnB then brings in the afrobeat and gives you some of that rage we heard in her last releases. A roper full album that is lush and should be listened to loudly, in full and definitely not on shuffle\\\" - Steph Walker\", \"3. Reb Fountain - Iris\", \"\\\"Firmly cementing herself in the Aotearoa Songbook with this breadth of writing equally with the incredible prior self-titled album\\\" - Lisa Paris\", \"\\\"Beguiling, melancholy and mysterious, perfectly captured the uncertainty of the times, and an even better record than last year's self-titled effort\\\" - Jeremy Taylor\", \"\\\"Reb Fountain is to be counted among our finest songwriters whose imagery is both personal and universal, and her command of a melody and a song transcends genre\\\" - Graham Reid\", \"Iris is the perfect extension of Reb Fountain's award winning 2020 self-titled record.\", \"Reb wrote the album during lockdown last year.\", \"\\\"Writing a song a day to keep myself grounded and productive during lockdown, Iris provided me an opportunity to speak my unspoken, to reflect what I have seen and experienced,\\\" she says of the album.\", \"Reb effortlessly combines pop elements with her trademark noir folk-punk sound. Iris elevates her music to new heights.\", \"2. Teeks - Something to Feel\", \"\\\"Something To Feel, beautiful album that holds Teeks' smooth vocal performance as it's central pou (pillar)\\\" \", \"Teeks' highly anticipated debut album Something To Feel was finally released this year.\", \"The growth, depth and beauty of Something To Feel represents, in essence, a complete surrender to human emotion.\", \"1. Mara TK - Bad Meditation\", \"\\\"Bad Meditation is such a taonga. It seems every person I ask has a different favourite song. This album speaks to so many but for me personally, I love the production on - Te kete aronui. To me it is a soothing and powerful reminder of papa\\\"- Maggie Tweedie\", \"This beautiful piece of Aotearoa psychedelic soul seemed to fall through the cracks for most people this year which is a real shame. Bad Meditation feels like a record befitting of 2021; searching, dark and a little bit weird. It's also a grower that rewards repeated listening. A classic New Zealand psych record that would fit nicely alongside any Unknown Mortal Orchestra record as a point of reference.\"]","href_hash":"c702ac345ab711ec9ba443da26b17799"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c702ac345ab711ec9ba443da26b17799"}},
