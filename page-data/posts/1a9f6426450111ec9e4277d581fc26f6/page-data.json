Chad Weaver: Max gets a phone call from an unknown person stating that they have a package to deliver to his son, Patrick. Max hangs up the phone, he tries to call Patrick.

They soon discovered that the killer had taken Patrick's computer and the hard drive from the home's security camera system.\\u00a0 Investigators also recovered unique shell casings from 300 Blackout ammunition, bullets often used in semi-automatic weapons like an AR-15. \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: When we saw the shell casings \\u2026 with how close they were to the body \\u2026 Immediately realized that this was a calculated murder.

Patrick wasn't harmed.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: There had been some complaints. \\u2026 And Patrick felt that the neighbor was shooting towards their house.\", \"There's night footage of the man being tackled and arrested by police for that incident. It was an intriguing lead until Weaver learned the man was in custody on the day Patrick was murdered.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: We were able to check him off the list.\", \"Detective Weaver then focused on some ominous voicemails that had been discovered:\", \"GREGORY BENDER VOICEMAIL: \\\"Call me back, talk to me.\\\"\\u00a0\", \".... which led them to a man that Patrick and Jessica knew quite well.\", \"GREGORY BENDER VOICEMAIL: \\\"I'll talk to you soon, I hope.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Jessica Devnani: I was really scared because. \\u2026 Like, he was always shadowing my life.\", \"A couple in love with everything in front of them, dreams of marriage and family about to come true.\", \"Then came February 27, 2018.\\u00a0 When Jessica Devnani came upon her fianc\\u00e9, Patrick De La Cerda in a pool of blood at his home shot four times at close range by an assassin.\", \"Jessica Devnani: I think my mind just doesn't want to accept it \\u2026 My whole future was taken away. My whole world was taken away.\", \"The ambush style-assault of Patrick made it seem like the killer was lying in wait.

Chad Weaver: And we were speaking to her about any enemies or any problems with anyone, you know, that Patrick had had.\", \"The detective learned that there was someone who wasn't happy with Jessica and Patrick's whirlwind romance.\", \"Peter Van Sant: Who was that person?\", \"Jessica Devnani: My ex, Gregory Bender.\", \"Jessica told Detective Weaver that right before she met Patrick, she broke up with Bender, her ex-boyfriend of 8 years. It was a breakup that he was not happy with.\\u00a0\", \"Jessica Devnani: He was not accepting of it\\u2014it's almost like he never left.\\u00a0 Like he was shadowing my life, like he was not accepting of it at all.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: He was very controlling.\", \"And as Weaver was about to learn, Jessica and Bender had a very complicated, love-hate kind of relationship over the eight years they were together.\\u00a0\", \"Jessica Devnani: He could be very charming and manipulative.\", \"At 42 years old, Bender was almost twice Jessica's age when they first met online in 2009. He was a successful hedge fund manager who lived in this house in Windemere, a wealthy suburb outside of Orlando.\", \"Jessica Devnani: He had a very charismatic personality. He was very intelligent. \\u2026 It felt like we'd known each other all our lives. He became my best friend.\", \"Peter Van Sant: Was he a down-to-earth kind of guy?\", \"Jessica Devnani: Not so much in the sense that he did like to show off. \\u2026\\u00a0 He loved fast cars and he loved guns as well.\", \"But what, if anything, did Gregory Bender have to do with Patrick's death? Detective Weaver wanted to know more.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: Patrick was middle class, blue collar, hard-working young man. Gregory, on the other hand, who's white collar, well educated, lived in a three quarter of a million dollar house ... Totally different people from totally different walks of life.\", \"Jessica told the detective that Greg Bender simply couldn't tolerate the idea of any other man in her life. She told a story about what happened when she briefly dated someone else after first meeting Greg.\\u00a0\", \"Jessica Devnani: He did stalk the person that I was dating. And he described exactly where he lived. And he said that he would tie him up and harm him.\", \"Peter Van Sant: So, a relationship that had love in it now had a little bit of terror in it.\", \"Jessica Devnani: I never feared what he could do to me, but I feared what he could do to other men.\", \"Despite his jealousness and verbal threats, Jessica accepted Greg's proposal to marry a few years into their relationship.\", \"Jessica Devnani: I was in love with him at the time. And maybe I was a little bit naive at the time. I didn't want to find someone else.\", \"And there is another twist in Jessica's twisted relationship with Gregory. In early 2016, he was having a procedure done at a local hospital. Jessica decided to drop by for a surprise visit.\\u00a0 When she entered his room, another woman was there.\", \"Jessica Devnani: I was like, \\\"what is she doing here?\\\"\\u00a0 And she's like, \\\"What are you doing here?\\\" \\u2026 And I told her, I'm like his fianc\\u00e9e and I showed her the ring.\\u00a0 And then she showed me her ring.\\u00a0 She's like, \\\"I'm his wife!\\\"\", \"She was Daymara Sanchez.\", \"Peter Van Sant: He's secretly married to this woman?\\u00a0\", \"Jessica Devnani: Yes. \\u2026 My heart just dropped. I couldn't believe it. I was in shock.\", \"Several days passed when Bender finally called Jessica, and tried to explain that he had only married Sanchez so her son could go to school in the district where his house was located.\", \"Jessica Devnani: And he said, \\\"I'm so sorry.\\\" ...\\u00a0 And he told me that he had only married her, as like, a business marriage. He was just trying to help her out and they had an arrangement together.\", \"At that point, Jessica had sort of had enough.\", \"Peter Van Sant: So, you end up giving Greg Bender an ultimatum. What was that?\", \"Jessica Devnani: Yes, I told him that he had until the end of the year to leave her.\", \"Peter Van Sant: He had to divorce her, not only leave but divorce.\", \"Jessica Devnani: Yes.\", \"But that \\\"business marriage\\\" line was just another of Bender's lies and he stayed married to Sanchez. With that, Jessica finally ended the relationship in 2017. One month later, Jessica met Patrick and began dating him. But Bender was often on her mind.\", \"Jessica Devnani: I was afraid that he would find out about our relationship.\", \"But just five months after dumping him\\u2026 \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Jessica Devnani: Gregory Bender\\u2026came across our Facebook page.\", \"Jessica Devnani: He immediately started messaging Patrick on his Facebook, threatening him \\u2026 And he said, \\\"I know where you live. I'm going to harm you guys.\\\"\", \"Bender left ominous voicemails like this one:\", \"GREGORY BENDER: \\\"I'm giving instructions. And I'm going to have my plan put into action.\\\"\", \"Peter Van Sant: What's he talking about?\\u00a0\", \"Jessica Devnani: At that point in time, he had mentioned to me that he was going to hire a hit man\\u2026or he was going to do the job himself.\", \"Peter Van Sant: And what job was that?\\u00a0\", \"Jessica Devnani: To kill Patrick.\", \"Enough was enough. Jessica and Patrick had these tapes and text messages presented to a judge who issued a restraining order. Bender was ordered to stay away from Jessica and turn in his large collection of firearms to authorities.\\u00a0\", \"Peter Van Sant: Did Greg Bender go away?\", \"Jessica Devnani: We thought he did go away. We didn't hear anything. And we felt confident.\", \"Until she told Detective Weaver that on the morning of Patrick's murder, Gregory Bender called for the first time in two months.\", \"Jessica Devnani: He called my job that very morning.\", \"But Jessica said she didn't answer.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: So, when she got the phone call and saw on the caller ID that it was Gregory Bender, flags started going up and that's what made her so worried.\", \"Flags were also going up for Detective Weaver. He believed he now had a prime suspect in Patrick's death. And, Weaver had an idea; now was the time for Jessica to return Bender's calls and investigators would listen in.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: She really wanted to solve Patrick's murder, so she did that without hesitation.\", \"DET. WEAVER: OK, call him and put him on speakerphone.\", \"GREGORY BENDER: Hello.\", \"JESSICA DEVNANI: Hello.\\u00a0\", \"Detective Weaver was hopeful Bender might say something to implicate himself:\", \"JESSICA DEVNANI:\\u00a0 You ruined my life. \\u2026 You got your revenge, and you ruined my life.\\u00a0\", \"GREGORY BENDER: What are you talking about?\", \"It was a tense, awkward moment. Just a few hours after she'd seen her fianc\\u00e9's body, investigators' asked Jessica Devnani to call the man they thought may have murdered him. Gregory Bender quickly spoke up.\\u00a0\", \"GREGORY BENDER: I saw what happened on the news, I want to tell you, I feel sorry for you.\\u00a0\", \"Jessica Devnani: I just wanted to try to do everything I could to help the investigation.\\u00a0\", \"She reminded Bender about his previous threats.\", \"JESSICA DEVNANI: You said, \\\"Enough is enough. I can't do this. I'm going to hire a hitman. I'm gonna kill him.\\\"\", \"GREGORY BENDER: No. That's not. No, no, no, I didn't say that.\", \"Peter Van Sant: Did you ask him outright, \\\"did you shoot Patrick?\\\"\", \"Jessica Devnani: I did. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"JESSICA DEVNANI: But that's why I want to find out if it is you, like \\u2026\", \"GREGORY BENDER: No, it's not. I'm your friend. I did not do this.\", \"Peter Van Sant: Could you tell he was lying to you?\", \"Jessica Devnani: Yes, I could tell he was lying.\\u00a0\", \"While Bender denied any involvement in Patrick's death, Detective Chad Weaver says there was enough evidence to arrest him: not for murder, but for violating that restraining order.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: We had seen that he \\u2026. attempted to contact her twice at work, which we found was a violation of that injunction.\", \"Even with Bender behind bars for the night, Detective Weaver didn't have much to link him to Patrick's murder. Then he received a phone call from the attorney of Bender's now ex-wife Daymara Sanchez \\u2014 the woman Jessica had first met in the hospital.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: And he said \\u2026 \\\"She has some information that will be valuable to your case.\\\"\", \"Sanchez asked to meet Detective Weaver in a parking lot.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: She's very, very nervous. \\u2026 She didn't want us coming to her house.\", \"It turns out Sanchez had a pretty good reason to be nervous. She was about to provide a crucial piece of evidence.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: So, we spoke with her, she had told us that \\u2026 her and Gregory had gotten a divorce and she had moved out in December of 2017. Around that same time, she had discovered what she believed to be a murder plan in a spiral notebook that she had seen Gregory writing in in the past.\", \"A murder plan, handwritten in a notebook detailing an elaborate plot to kill. Sanchez said when she confronted Bender about it, he told her it was all a fantasy. And she forgot about it until she saw the report that the man Bender was supposedly fantasizing about killing had just been murdered.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: Once she told us about the murder plan, that gave us what we needed to get into the house to see, you know, what else was in there.\", \"Volusia County Prosecutor Ashley Terwilleger says learning about the murder plan was a potential game changer \\u2014 if investigators could find it.\\u00a0\", \"Ashley Terwilleger: So, the next day, February 28 of 2018, they execute the search warrant at Gregory Bender's home in Orange County, Florida, in Windemere.\", \"Detective Weaver had some doubts. But almost as soon as he entered Bender's house, Weaver hit paydirt. He spotted several balls of crumpled-up note paper.\\u00a0\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: I looked in the trash can and \\u2026 I was in shock, there's no way that we just found this murder plan. The first thing I wanted to do was reach in the trash can, grab it.\", \"Weaver wisely held off while this paper was bagged and tagged for forensics. Later, when he was able to read the plan, it was just as Sanchez said \\u2014 a detailed road map for murdering Patrick De La Cerda.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: Some of the first things in it were directions. \\u2026 It actually had Patrick De La Cerda's address. Howland Boulevard.\", \"Weaver took \\\"48 Hours\\\" to the crime scene to explain how the plan matched the actual murder.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: This road leads down the side of the property, it's off of Howland Boulevard. This is important because of the dirt road that was drawn on the murder plan runs down the side of the property. \\u2026 It's pretty heavily wooded down this way, so I think he walked on foot until he got to this opening and this is the area, we believe Gregory Bender accessed to sneak up on our victim. \\u2026 The sketch of the property was spot on.\", \"The plan was evidence of Bender's obsession with detail and compulsion to kill, says Weaver.\", \"The plan read: \\\"Put duct tape on the bottom of a second pair of shoes so no tread prints\\\" \\u2026 \\\"wait for confirm that he is alone. Then turn off cell phones\\\" \\u2026\\u00a0 \\\"and dispose of clothes, plate, tracker, gloves\\\"\\u00a0\", \"With the murder plan in hand, Weaver had a powerful case against Bender. And with the discovery of this ammunition, there was now a direct link to those unique bullet shells found at the scene.\\u00a0\", \"Ashley Terwilleger: They find that arsenal of 300-blackout ammunition.\\u00a0\", \"Remember, Patrick was shot four times with that type of unique ammo, but only two shell casings were recovered at the crime scene. That's what made another discovery by investigators at Bender's house so important.\", \"Ashley Terwilleger: They find a shell casing in a desk drawer, essentially a junk drawer.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: The casing \\u2026 matched the two recovered shell casings from the crime scene. \\u2026\\u00a0 Short of actually finding the murder weapon, um in my opinion, I think that was probably the most important piece of evidence that we found.\", \"That's because the murder weapon has never been recovered, although Jessica remembers seeing a powerful rifle at Bender's house when they dated.\", \"Peter Van Sant: The AR-15, this semi-automatic rifle.\\u00a0 Did he have one of those?\", \"Jessica Devnani: Yes, he did.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: I think it's probably at the bottom of a lake somewhere.\\u00a0\", \"The evidence was overwhelming \\u2013 Weaver now had a clear and concise theory of the crime.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: Greg Bender was lying in wait in the bushes, just out of view. He made the phone call posing as a delivery man. Patrick receives a text message just thinking that he has a package.\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: And as Patrick answered the door, he shot and killed him.\", \"Less than 48 hours after Patrick's death, an arrest warrant was issued for Gregory Bender, charging him with the murder. Volusia County sheriff's deputies had an easy time locating their suspect, who had been released from jail after violating that restraining order. Bender was in his own front yard, says prosecutor Andrew Urbanak.\", \"Andy Urbanak: Mr. Bender actually showed up, bonded out from the Orange County jail just a short time after they started executing that warrant. \\u00a0\", \"Det. Chad Weaver: You can't make this stuff up.\", \"For Patrick's mother, the arrest is just the first step against a man she despises.\", \"Patricia Ronze: Psychopath, that's what he is. \\u2026 You want me to say his name? I'll never pronounce his name. I don't want to pronounce his name. That is hurting my mouth to just say his name.\", \"Peter Van Sant: Why did Patrick have to die?\", \"Jessica Devnani: Just out of jealousy of a man that was obsessed \\u2026 and he thought that, by doing this, that I would go back to him.\\u00a0\", \"But with no weapon, no eyewitnesses, and no DNA at the crime scene \\u2026\\u00a0\", \"Richard Parker | Defense attorney: Ultimately, this case \\u2026 is a circumstantial case.\", \"\\u2026 Bender and his attorneys are planning a vigorous trial defense.\", \"And.using undercover video shot by a private eye, they plan to challenge Jessica on the stand about the real nature of her relationship with Greg Bender.\\u00a0\", \"RICHARD PARKER [to Jessica in court]: You started dating Patrick in June.

On secretly recorded video, it appears Bender and Jessica are at lunch, and then a week later at a restaurant enjoying dinner, just a few months after she started dating Patrick. \\u00a0\", \"PROSECUTOR ANDREW URBANAK: Did you actually see these videos? \\u00a0\", \"JESSICA DEVNANI: I did.\", \"The encounters were captured by a private investigator hired by Bender.
