Ms. Peng has not been seen in public since Nov. 2, when she posted the accusation on social media against Zhang Gaoli, a former vice premier.\", \"According to C.G.T.N., Ms. Peng said in her email that \\u201cI am not missing, nor am I unsafe. I\\u2019ve just been resting at home and everything is fine.\\u201d The email also said the allegation of sexual assault \\u201cis not true.\\u201d\", \"Steve Simon, the chief executive of the WTA Tour, cast doubt on the veracity of the email.\", \"\\u201cThe statement released today by Chinese state media concerning Peng Shuai only raises my concerns as to her safety and whereabouts,\\u201d he said in a statement. \\u201cI have a hard time believing that Peng Shuai actually wrote the email we received or believes what is being attributed to her.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Simon said he had repeatedly tried to reach Ms. Peng, without success.\", \"\\u201cPeng Shuai must be allowed to speak freely, without coercion or intimidation from any source,\\u201d the statement added. \\u201cHer allegation of sexual assault must be respected, investigated with full transparency and without censorship.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Peng\\u2019s Nov. 2 post briefly sent shock waves through Chinese society. Other high-profile men have been accused of sexual misconduct amid the country\\u2019s budding #MeToo movement. But her accusation touched the highest levels of its political leadership. Mr. Zhang had been a member of the Communist Party\\u2019s Politburo Standing Committee, its highest ruling body, between 2012 and 2017.\", \"Her post and any discussions of it were immediately taken down from China\\u2019s heavily censored internet. Ms. Peng\\u2019s verified account on the social media platform Weibo was also taken down, though on Thursday it appeared to have been restored, with all posts after early 2020 deleted.\", \"Neither Mr. Zhang nor the Chinese government have publicly commented on Ms. Peng\\u2019s allegations, which could not be independently verified. The statement from C.G.T.N. did not appear to have been published on China Central Television, its Chinese-language state-run parent, or on other official Chinese-language media.\", \"Some of the tennis world\\u2019s biggest stars have spoken out in recent days in support of Ms. Peng and called for an investigation into Ms. Peng\\u2019s allegations.\", \"Naomi Osaka of Japan wrote on Twitter that \\u201ccensorship is never ok at any cost.\\u201d Chris Evert, the American former world champion, called the accusations \\u201cvery disturbing.\\u201d The British tennis player Liam Broady wrote of Ms. Peng\\u2019s disappearance, \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe this is even happening in the 21st century.\\u201d\", \"Novak Djokovic, the world\\u2019s No. 1 men\\u2019s player, said the limited details surrounding Ms. Peng\\u2019s whereabouts were \\u201cshocking.\\u201d\", \"The WTA\\u2019s comments and attention on Ms. Peng could hurt the tour\\u2019s lucrative business relationship with China, but that didn\\u2019t appear to stop the tour from continuing to speak out.\", \"Mr. Simon first called on the Chinese authorities to investigate Ms. Peng\\u2019s allegations on Sunday and suggested that the tour might stop doing business in China if the WTA did not \\u201csee appropriate results.\\u201d\", \"The governing body of men\\u2019s tennis, the ATP Tour, later weighed in to support calls to investigate Ms. Peng\\u2019s allegations.\", \"\\u201cWe have been deeply concerned by the uncertainty surrounding the immediate safety and whereabouts of WTA player Peng Shuai,\\u201d Andrea Gaudenzi, the chairman of the ATP, said in a statement.\", \"The ATP, he wrote, stood \\u201cin full support of the WTA\\u2019s call for a full, fair and transparent investigation.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a1cb36cb481511ec82c66f483a92531f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a1cb36cb481511ec82c66f483a92531f"}},
