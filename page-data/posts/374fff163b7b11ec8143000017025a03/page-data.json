Scott was let go by the Mets on Monday, two months after he was placed on administrative leave, according to a baseball executive who had been briefed on the matter but could not speak publicly about it.\", \"SNY, the Mets television network, reported the news first.\", \"After many years in the Boston Red Sox organization, Scott was hired by the Mets in December to be an assistant general manager. He was promoted to general manager on an interim basis after Jared Porter was fired from his post in January following allegations that he had sexually harassed a female reporter.\", \"Scott oversaw a team that won only 77 games and that fired Manager Luis Rojas shortly after the season ended. But Scott\\u2019s position in the organization had become untenable after he was arrested in White Plains, N.Y., on a drunken-driving charge. That case is still pending.\", \"After Scott was suspended, Sandy Alderson, the team\\u2019s president, stepped in to fulfill the duties of general manager, but the team is looking to hire a permanent president of baseball operations so that Alderson can retreat into a broader role as an adviser to the team owner, Steven Cohen.\", \"The team has so far failed to land any of the well-known targets for the president\\u2019s job, like Theo Epstein and Billy Beane, so it is said to now be looking for a younger, less experienced person to take over the operation.\"]","href_hash":"374fff163b7b11ec8143000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"374fff163b7b11ec8143000017025a03"}},
