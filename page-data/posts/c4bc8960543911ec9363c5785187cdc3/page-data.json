It was founded in 1969 by His Eminence Archbishop Franzo W. King, D.D., and his wife, the Most Rev. Supreme Mother Marina King, before they possessed such lofty titles. (Their daughter, the Rev. Chaplain Wanika Stephens, Archpriest, M.A., is also a pastor there.) The church began around 1964, as the Jazz Club in the couple\\u2019s garage \\u2014 \\u201ca listening clinic,\\u201d F.W. King, now 77, says on a recent Zoom call with his wife, 75, from their home in San Francisco\\u2019s Bayview-Hunters Point. (Their daughter, 57, also joined.) \\u201cMaybe less than a dozen brothers and sisters would come together every week. Everybody would bring a new album. We\\u2019d put the music on and start testing our ears and our knowledge,\\u201d seeing if they could name the drummer or the piano player on a track without looking at the record sleeve. One day, someone brought Coltrane\\u2019s 1965 record \\u201cA Love Supreme,\\u201d and King looked at the liner notes, which Coltrane wrote himself. \\u201cAll Praise be to God to whom all praise is due,\\u201d Coltrane begins, and then tells a story: \\u201cDuring the year 1957,\\u201d he writes, \\u201cI experienced, by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music.\\u201d In those years, Coltrane was addicted to heroin and \\u2014 so the legend goes \\u2014 while experiencing withdrawals heard the voice of God and got clean, rededicating his life to music.\", \"\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t really that impressed!\\u201d King says. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t even want to listen to the album.\\u201d His own father had been a Pentecostal minister, and King believed back then that he had \\u201csuccessfully escaped from the raft of the church.\\u201d This changed a few months later, when he and his wife attended a Coltrane concert at the Jazz Workshop, in San Francisco\\u2019s North Beach neighborhood, to celebrate their first wedding anniversary; the doorman was a friend and sat the couple right in front of the stage. \\u201cSo we were able to get a full dose,\\u201d King says. There have been countless attempts to capture the power of Coltrane\\u2019s music \\u2014 his unmatched ear for both melody and chaos, his seemingly endless ability to find new sounds in traditional chords, the complex interplay between him and his band (which, in addition to Coltrane on saxophone, included Jimmy Garrison on bass, Elvin Jones on drums and McCoy Tyner on piano) \\u2014 but, to King, \\u201cIt was as though he was speaking in tongues and there was fire coming from heaven \\u2014 a sound baptism,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThat began the evolutionary, transitional process of us becoming truly born-again believers in that anointed sound that leaped down from the tone of heaven out of the very mind of God, stepped from the very wall of creation and took on a gob of flesh, and we beheld his beauty as one that was called John.\\u201d\", \"There is a long and rich tradition of popular music fans deifying their icons. A famous, if dubious, graffiti tag in mid-60s London consecrated the then-lead guitarist for the Yardbirds, proclaiming, \\u201c[Eric] Clapton is God.\\u201d The mythology surrounding the blues singer and guitarist Robert Johnson claims he sold his soul to the devil sometime in the 1930s in order to gain mastery over his instrument. Google a certain disgraced pop star in 2021 and the algorithm might helpfully suggest the following question: \\u201cWas Michael Jackson a gift from God?\\u201d Any musician who is heralded as the second coming tends to be brought back down to earth eventually, whether through changing tastes or human foibles (Clapton is now an anti-vaccine proponent), though there was always something different about Coltrane, whose death from cancer in 1967 at age 40 transformed him into a kind of martyr. Through the years, the story of Coltrane\\u2019s veneration has been treated by his critics and biographers as a quirky footnote to his afterlife, if not ignored entirely, but it provides a revealing glimpse at his legacy, as well as a key to understanding the intensity of his appeal.\", \"\\u201cDO YOU HAVE a religious affiliation at all yourself?\\u201d Archbishop King asks me over Zoom. \\u201cLapsed Catholic,\\u201d I say, which isn\\u2019t inaccurate. I suggest, somewhat humorlessly, that for this reason I consider the liner notes to \\u201cA Love Supreme\\u201d \\u2014 Coltrane\\u2019s most famous recording, and one of the great achievements in all of music \\u2014 to be more legitimate than the Lord\\u2019s Prayer.\", \"\\u201cCheck this out, Brother Miller,\\u201d King says, and he and his wife begin singing the \\u201cOur Father\\u201d in exquisite harmony to the tune of \\u201cPsalm,\\u201d the closing section of \\u201cA Love Supreme,\\u201d after which \\u2014 and this isn\\u2019t a joke, either \\u2014 I offer out my hands, clasped as if in prayer, to them in thanks.\", \"\\u201cI think most real Coltrane devotees are lapsed religious people in one sense,\\u201d the archbishop says. \\u201cReligion is so much built on what we believe. And a lot of times what we believe is because we\\u2019ve been trained to believe it, keeping in mind that believing falls short of knowing. And if you ask too many questions for the sake of knowledge, you might get excommunicated. So we\\u2019re sympathetic with that.\\u201d\", \"It was only after King saw Coltrane live again a few months later that he began to think of the club in his garage as more of a temple. The Kings had to travel to a venue in a white neighborhood, where King found that the audience \\u201cwas not so populated with people who looked like me.\\u201d Coltrane himself had been talking about the treatment of musicians in clubs, saying that \\u201cthe music is rising into something else,\\u201d and that it would need a different context. Around this time, King had been learning how to play the saxophone, and was gigging in San Francisco with his teacher, Norman Terrell Williams. The duo began attracting a following, and the venue filled up nightly with patrons. King asked Williams if, as a result, its white owner had given him a raise. \\u201cAnd he said, \\u2018Nah, man,\\u2019\\u201d King recalls. \\u201cAnd I said, \\u2018Something\\u2019s wrong with this.\\u2019 To me it was just unacceptable.\\u201d\", \"Coltrane\\u2019s music provided an outlet for such frustrations. Around the same time that he was quoting Jesus in his liner notes, various changes were underway in San Francisco\\u2019s Black community. Black churches had been at the center of the civil rights movement for most of the 1960s, preaching a message of pacifism and nonviolence, but in 1966, when Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party across the bay in Oakland, the fight for equality became a brash, revolutionary one. Around then, the Kings moved out of the garage and into a storefront in the working-class neighborhood of Visitation Valley, where they became known as the Yardbird Temple Vanguard Revolutionary Church of the Hour. Coltrane \\u2014 in no small part thanks to the Kings \\u2014 became the hero of not just the Black Panther Party but the burgeoning Black power movement at large. Newton often spoke of how more traditional churches had failed Black society; Miles Davis, with whom Coltrane had some of his earliest successes as a sideman, writes in his 1989 autobiography that by the time the Black Panthers formed, Coltrane\\u2019s music had become \\u201cfor many blacks, the fire and passion and rage and anger and rebellion and love that they felt.\\u201d\", \"The musician was an unexpected choice for a revolutionary lodestar, for his message was ultimately one of peace and harmony. \\u201cI think music can make the world better and, if I\\u2019m qualified, I want to do it,\\u201d he once said. Though that doesn\\u2019t mean he was apolitical: One of his finest songs, \\u201cAlabama,\\u201d was written in 1963, in response to the Ku Klux Klan\\u2019s bombing of a Baptist church in Birmingham that year, killing four Black children. It\\u2019s one of the great works of art produced by the civil rights movement, and Coltrane\\u2019s band never sounded better. Garrison and Jones work themselves into a funereal groove, and Tyner somehow makes his piano sound like it\\u2019s crying. Coltrane on the tenor sax is nothing less than the sound of dignity prevailing through overwhelming tragedy.\", \"Though the Black Panthers were, as King notes, atheists, they became some of his church\\u2019s most ardent supporters. Out of the storefront in the Western Addition, King was preaching that Coltrane was Christ incarnate, and structuring a weekly meeting around his music, especially \\u201cA Love Supreme,\\u201d a suite in four parts \\u2014 \\u201cAcknowledgement,\\u201d \\u201cResolution,\\u201d \\u201cPursuance,\\u201d \\u201cPsalm\\u201d \\u2014 that has the loose structure of a prayer service. And King, in turn, realized that the Panthers\\u2019 Marxist ideology (\\u201cDialectical materialism,\\u201d as Marina says with a small sigh) had more in common with the Christian faith than he might have expected.\", \"The Kings\\u2019 dogma may have been untraditional, but for the most part they did and still do what most churches do \\u2014 perform music, meditate, offer prayers, organize food drives. (Colloquially, they are known in the Bay Area as the Beans and Rice Church: \\u201cFree vegetarian meals!\\u201d Marina says excitedly at one point in our interview.) In 1972, for the Black Panther Community Survival Program at the Oakland Auditorium, the church\\u2019s house band opened for Ike and Tina Turner and helped pass out thousands of bags of groceries to families in need. Newton and Seale had promised a whole chicken in each one and told the Kings that they needed $2,000 to \\u201cget the chickens out of hostage to give them to the people.\\u201d The church raised the funds to do so and, in thanks, Newton commissioned Emory Douglas, the Panthers\\u2019 minister of culture, to make a Coltrane painting \\u2014 it became something like the church\\u2019s first icon. The Kings are sitting in front of it when we speak on Zoom.\", \"Of course, the Kings have also been met with skepticism over the years. Alice Coltrane, the artist\\u2019s widow (and his piano player in the last years of his career), was a friend of the Kings and a religious leader in her own right. She converted to Hinduism after Coltrane\\u2019s death and founded the Vedantic Center near Malibu, and the Kings considered her to be their guru. (They sing in Sanskrit on some of her early devotional music.) But in 1981, she sued the church, then known as the One Mind Temple Evolutionary Transitional Church of Christ, for copyright infringement and for using her late husband\\u2019s name without permission. A spokesman for the church at the time asked The New York Times, in its defense, \\u201cDid you ever think it was necessary to ask Mother Mary to use Jesus\\u2019 name?\\u201d\", \"The suit was eventually dropped, but it turned out to be fortuitous; it brought the Kings to the attention of leaders in the African Orthodox Church, which was founded in New York City in the early 20th century by defectors from the Episcopalian faith. George Duncan Hinkson, a bishop in the A.O.C., told the Kings that Coltrane couldn\\u2019t be their god, but he could be their patron saint. (When asked what he wanted to be in 10 years in a 1966 interview, Coltrane, whose father and grandfather were Methodist ministers, famously replied, \\u201cA saint.\\u201d) \\u201cSo I said,\\u201d King tells me, \\u201c\\u2018Well, we ain\\u2019t got no problem with that,\\u2019\\u201d and in 1982, the A.O.C. officially canonized Coltrane. The Kings began studying orthodoxy, commissioning icon paintings in the Byzantine style, and changed the congregation\\u2019s name to the Saint John Coltrane African Orthodox Church. In the years since, gentrification has forced them to move around San Francisco, holding weekly services (they migrated to Facebook during the pandemic) and preaching what they call \\u201cColtrane Consciousness.\\u201d People have made pilgrimages from across the world to attend these services the way other devotees might travel to Rishikesh, India, or Jerusalem.\", \"THAT\\u2019S THE STORY of how a postwar 20th-century musician became a saint, but it still leaves the question: Why Coltrane? What is it about him that makes people dedicate their entire lives to his art? So many other musicians have made music with overtly Christian themes and been celebrated for it \\u2014 Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, Bono, Kanye West and Justin Bieber, to name just a few \\u2014 though many of them (the men, anyway) also seemed to present themselves as self-consciously Christlike in doing so. (West, for instance, preached the dangers of pornography and premarital sex when publicizing his 2019 record \\u201cJesus Is King.\\u201d) But what\\u2019s always struck me about Coltrane, and \\u201cA Love Supreme\\u201d in particular, is how welcoming he is in his approach to spirituality, how lacking in judgment. He seemed to know how good he was on a technical level \\u2014 he certainly thought making people happy with his music was an achievable goal \\u2014 but he also harbored no delusions of grandeur. Nearly every account that exists of him depicts a quiet and somewhat shy family man. He spent most of his free time practicing. He drove a Chrysler station wagon and lived on Long Island. It\\u2019s not that his music filtered out the banality of being human but that he had an uncanny ability to make his human flaws into something useful. The difference between Coltrane the man and Coltrane the performer was a nearly alchemical transfiguration.\", \"It\\u2019s no coincidence that, more than any other figure in the history of American music, his admirers tend to experience his work the way others might undergo a religious epiphany. \\u201cI thought I was going to die from the emotion,\\u201d the musician Joe McPhee once told the critic Ben Ratliff of witnessing a 1965 Coltrane concert at the Village Gate in New York. The record producer George Avakian, as recounted in Davis\\u2019s autobiography, once said that Coltrane \\u201cseemed to grow taller in height and larger in size with each note that he played,\\u201d that he \\u201cseemed to be pushing each chord to its outer limits, out into space.\\u201d On our Zoom call, Stephens describes a similar experience when \\u201cSong of Praise,\\u201d a deep cut from the 1965 album \\u201cThe John Coltrane Quartet Plays,\\u201d came on one day when she was vacuuming her living room. As she says, \\u201cJohn Coltrane spoke to me.\\u201d\", \"There are enough stories like this to create an entire subgenre, but my personal favorite, and the one that best explains Coltrane\\u2019s lasting appeal, comes from the poet and playwright Amiri Baraka\\u2019s liner notes for the 1964 album \\u201cLive at Birdland,\\u201d a concert at the historic club just north of Times Square, sessions for which Baraka, then known as LeRoi Jones, was in attendance. In describing the extreme contrast of Coltrane\\u2019s transcendent, highly emotional music \\u2014 \\u201cone of the reasons suicide seems so boring\\u201d \\u2014 and its earthly setting, he writes, \\u201cBirdland is a place no man should wander into unarmed.\", \"\\u201cAfter riding a subway through New York\\u2019s bowels,\\u201d he continues, \\u201cand that subway full of all the many things any man should expect to find in something\\u2019s bowels, and then coming up stairs to the street and walking slowly, head down, through the traffic and failure that does shape this place, and then entering \\u2018the Jazz Corner of the World,\\u2019 a temple erected in praise of what God (?), and then finally amidst that noise and glare to hear a man destroy all of it, completely, like Sodom, with just the first few notes from his horn, your \\u2018critical\\u2019 sense can be erased completely, and that experience can place you somewhere a long way off from anything ugly.\\u201d\", \"Baraka admits that there are people who can\\u2019t hear what he calls the \\u201cdaringly human quality\\u201d of Coltrane, as if the notes he played were on a wavelength that simply didn\\u2019t register for certain nonbelievers. Even the most beloved music, like all art forms, falls in and out of style. But Coltrane\\u2019s work has not only endured, it\\u2019s become ever more embraced, inspiring greater fervor the further removed we get from its original recording. The only other thing that compares is, curiously, religion itself. If you allow yourself to hear Coltrane \\u2014 really hear him \\u2014 his music, like God or Buddha or Dharma or Allah, can, as Baraka describes it, \\u201cmake you think a lot of weird and wonderful things.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c4bc8960543911ec9363c5785187cdc3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c4bc8960543911ec9363c5785187cdc3"}},
