Looking at public opinion right now, it\\u2019s hard to escape the impression that it\\u2019s very bad indeed.\", \"In principle, voters should judge politicians by their actions; they should support politicians who pursue policies that help them, oppose politicians whose policies would hurt them. To do this, however, voters should have a reasonably good idea of what policy is doing.\", \"Unfortunately, when it comes to economic policy \\u2014 which should be the easiest kind of policy to evaluate, since its effects are visible in everyone\\u2019s daily life \\u2014 there are few reasons to be optimistic about the relationship between policy and public opinion.\", \"In a sensible world, voters would have both a reasonably accurate picture of what\\u2019s happening in the economy and a basic understanding of what aspects of the economy are under politicians\\u2019 control. In the world we live in, neither of these things is true.\", \"Start with the state of the economy. You might be tempted to assume that in a world in which getting and spending occupies a large part of everyone\\u2019s life, people would have a pretty good sense of how the economy is doing, even if they aren\\u2019t familiar with national income accounting. In reality, however, economic perceptions are largely shaped by media coverage \\u2014 and, increasingly, by partisanship.\", \"Indeed, the role of partisan skew has gotten so large recently that the Michigan Survey of Consumers, probably the most influential gauge of economic perceptions, highlighted it in its most recent data release; you might say that the Michigan Survey has warned us not to trust the Michigan Survey. Here\\u2019s how consumer sentiment has changed among self-identified Democrats and Republicans since 2019:\", \"So when the White House changed hands, Democrats began offering a somewhat more positive assessment of the economy, while Republicans became vastly more negative. In fact, Republicans now have a more negative assessment of economic conditions than they had in March 2009, the depths of the financial crisis, when the unemployment rate was 8.7 percent and the economy was losing 800,000 jobs a month.\", \"You might be tempted to say that this divergence in part reflects differences in the kind of people who vote for the two parties: Small-business owners, who are strongly Republican, are suffering from labor shortages, while low-paid workers, who tend to vote for Democrats, are experiencing above-average wage gains.\", \"But other data show a huge divergence between what people say about the state of the economy, which is quite negative on average, and what they say about their own personal finances, which is fairly positive. Here are survey results from Langer Research Associates:\", \"This divergence suggests that people\\u2019s views on the economy reflect what they\\u2019re seeing on often partisan news media and what their politics say should be happening, rather than what they themselves are experiencing.\", \"So many voters seem to have skewed perceptions of economic reality. Furthermore, to the extent that they see genuine problems, they may not be clear about which problems politicians can solve and which they can\\u2019t.\", \"Take the price of gasoline, which has risen about $1.50 a gallon from its pandemic lows:\", \"Higher gas prices represent a real hardship for many Americans \\u2014 and historically voters have seemed to blame the president when gas prices go up. Yet presidents have very little influence on prices at the pump.\", \"In the current episode, what\\u2019s driving gas prices is a surge in the global price of crude oil. Here\\u2019s the price of Brent crude, that is, the price in European markets (which generally moves in tandem with prices everywhere, because oil is a globalized commodity):\", \"Crude is up more than $60 a barrel. And since there are 42 gallons in a barrel, this means that the price of the crude oil used to make a gallon of gasoline has risen by $1.50 \\u2014 basically accounting for all of the rise in the price to consumers. That is, developments outside the control of any president are driving a price rise that is surely one factor in President Biden\\u2019s approval ratings.\", \"So we\\u2019re living in a nation with many voters who seem to have both a distorted view of the state of the economy and false beliefs about what aspects of the economy politicians can affect. How is democracy supposed to function well under these conditions?\", \"Just to be clear, I\\u2019m not condemning voters for not being economic experts. People have children to raise, jobs to do, lives to live. Expecting them to be sophisticated policy analysts is unreasonable.\", \"But the fact remains that public perceptions have become extremely disconnected from reality \\u2014 economics is just one example. It\\u2019s a real conundrum. And if you\\u2019re waiting for me to propose solutions, well, not today.\", \"People are angry about inflation.\", \"Bottlenecks and the bullwhip effect.\", \"Lying flat.\", \"The case for patience on inflation.\", \"After a grim newsletter, here\\u2019s some joy.\"]","href_hash":"c0fcebf6471111eca506efca244c71c9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c0fcebf6471111eca506efca244c71c9"}},
