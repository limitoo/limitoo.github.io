Tunisians would vote on the new Constitution on July 25, 2022, the anniversary of the day Mr. Saied suspended Parliament and took control.\", \"Parliament will remain frozen until new elections on Dec. 17, 2022, he said.\", \"\\u201cI assume this responsibility before the people and before God,\\u201d Mr. Saied said. \\u201cWe seek to liberate our people and our country. We want to live in a just and peaceful country.\\u201d\", \"Monday\\u2019s announcement dispelled some of the uncertainty Tunisians have endured ever since Mr. Saied shunted Parliament aside last summer in what he said was an emergency move to save Tunisia from its cascading political, economic and Covid-19 crises.\", \"But it is less clear whether the referendum and elections will end up strengthening Tunisia\\u2019s fledgling democracy, the only one to emerge from the 2011 Arab Spring protests that began in Tunisia and swept through the region; pushing the country toward autocracy under Mr. Saied; or plunging it into yet more political turbulence.\", \"Many Tunisians at first embraced Mr. Saied\\u2019s actions, and he was hailed as a savior. Yet as the president consolidated greater power over the summer and fall, suspending much of the existing Constitution and granting himself the right to rule by decree, more Tunisians grew disenchanted with his leadership, or at least skeptical of it.\", \"Regular protests against Mr. Saied\\u2019s one-man rule sprang up in Tunis, the capital, as the president stayed largely silent on a political road map, failed to deliver much-anticipated economic reforms, arrested political opponents and shut down critical media outlets.\", \"While long delayed, Monday\\u2019s announcement came as little surprise. Mr. Saied has criticized the current Constitution since before it was adopted in 2014 after the fall of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia\\u2019s former dictator.\", \"A former constitutional law professor who was elected in a landslide in 2019, Mr. Saied has long advocated a so-called hourglass-shaped political system that he says would empower the people who drove the 2011 revolution.\", \"Under his proposed system, Tunisians would elect neighborhood-level local councils from which regional and national representatives would be drawn by lottery, while a powerful president would oversee foreign policy, the military and the country\\u2019s overall path.\", \"Mr. Saied did not say on Monday whether he would put such ideas forward in the referendum. But he said in an earlier decree that the commission to draft constitutional amendments would be appointed entirely by him, giving him unchecked sway over the final shape of the draft.\"]","href_hash":"4d216a5e5d1e11eca890bf440dcff6d4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4d216a5e5d1e11eca890bf440dcff6d4"}},
