Yet, only 23 of 59 Taskforce Scarecrow members originally submitted for the Purple Heart were recognized with the award.\", \"\\\"Our service members were wounded as a result of action by a hostile foreign force and deserve to be awarded with the Purple Heart which recognizes a casualty was sustained,\\\" the representatives wrote. \\\"We owe it to take care of these soldiers above all else.\\\"\", \"The soldiers CBS News spoke with said after the attack, there was pressure to downplay their growing injuries to avoid a further escalation with Iran and avoid undercutting former President Trump.\", \"A week after the attack, Mr. Trump was asked about the soldiers' injuries at a press conference. He said he\\u00a0\\\"heard they had headaches\\\"\\u00a0and \\\"I can report it is not very serious.\\\"\", \"When CBS News brought these cases to the Pentagon's attention, a spokesman said the Army's Human Resources Command would review the soldiers' Purple Heart submissions. The spokesman said the review would be expedited.\", \"\\\"HRC will evaluate each award nomination, to include posthumous submissions, expeditiously and on their individual merit in accordance with Army regulations,\\\" the spokesman said in a statement.\", \"One of the submissions is for 22-year-old Jason Quitugua, who took his own life last month. Quitugua, who was promoted to sergeant posthumously, defended the base when the missiles struck and was diagnosed with a TBI.\", \"\\\"He struggled, you know, like we all are, like I am,\\\" said Daine Kvasager, who served with Quitugua and was also denied the Purple Heart.\", \"Ksavager used to help run armed drone operations as part of the unit, but the now 31-year-old struggles with vision and hearing problems and suffers from constant headaches and memory loss. He says he can no longer do his job.\", \"\\\"The person I was prior to a traumatic brain injury, he's gone,\\\" Kvasager said. \\\"There's parts that remain. The pieces are all still there, just \\u2014 yeah, he's not coming back.\\\"\", \"Kvasager's superior officer Captain Geoffrey Hansen, 32, helped lead Taskforce Scarecrow and told CBS News the soldiers met the military's eligibility requirement for the award.\", \"\\\"Throughout my whole military career, I was always told 'we take care of soldiers above all else,'\\\" said Hansen, who recently was honorably discharged from the military and is attending business school. \\\"It shocks me that we have failed to do that in this situation.\\\"\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"91aef8f0493011ecb9afa58bdf699f52"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"91aef8f0493011ecb9afa58bdf699f52"}},
