Named for a 1940s public health law, the authority allows U.S. border officials to quickly expel migrants without allowing them to apply for asylum.\", \"Since August 2021, the CDC has been charged with reviewing Title 42 every 60 days to determine its continued necessity. The latest reassessment was due Wednesday. CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said the agency was still working on the review and would \\\"release more information later this week.\\\"\", \"High-profile Democratic allies of the president, including Senate Majority Chuck Schumer, had been calling on the administration to stop the Title 42 expulsions, citing the relaxation of other pandemic-related restrictions. \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Republican lawmakers and some centrist Democrats, however, had urged the administration to continue the expulsions, saying Title 42's rescission could trigger a sharp increase in migrant arrivals that would overwhelm U.S. border authorities and their processing capacity.\", \"Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.
