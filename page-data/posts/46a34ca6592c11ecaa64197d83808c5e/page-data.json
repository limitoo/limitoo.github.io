\"While the state surpassed the 80 per cent double-dose target for residents aged 16 and older yesterday, experts remain concerned about large pockets of Queenslanders yet to receive even a single shot of a COVID vaccine.\", \"Rates among Indigenous Queenslanders remain particularly dire.\\u00a0\", \"Percentages of double-vaccinated First Nations people in local government areas\\u00a0such as Burdekin (39 per cent), Cassowary Coast (39.6 per cent), Mareeba (39.2 per cent) and Tablelands (36.4 per cent) are less than half the rate across Queensland as a whole, which stands at 80.11 per cent.\", \"The issue is already causing Queensland's incoming Chief Health Officer John Gerrard headaches before he officially takes on the role from Monday, the day the state reopens its interstate borders to hotspots for the first time in months.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/fa61d6f829d6edcea884856538254b26\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

who have received two COVID-19 jabs, with local government areas such as Isaac (52.8 per cent), in Central Queensland, the Central Highlands (65.1 per cent) and Charters Towers (65.1 per cent), particularly problematic.\", \"Goondiwindi in the state's south remains a stand-out, with 91.5 per cent of its population fully vaccinated.\", \"About 800,000 Queensland children aged under 12 remain unvaccinated, with five to 11 year olds eligible to receive the jab from January.\", \"Federal government COVID-19 vaccination data shows of Queenslanders aged 16 and older, those aged 16-19 (67.19

as a number of vice chancellors of Queensland universities have written to the state\\u00a0government this week, encouraging a vaccine mandate for the tertiary sector.\", \"Griffith University (GU) -- which has five campuses in the state's south-east -- announced on Wednesday it was introducing its own policy, requiring staff and students to be fully vaccinated or agree to regular COVID-19 testing in order to return to campus next year.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e888c61a61dada1a81bf15f313587e26\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">

regular COVID-19 testing regime, however, this will be at their own expense, except for those with approved medical exemptions.\", \"Staff or students who are not fully vaccinated and refuse to participate in testing will be excluded from campus.\", \"\\\"If alternative arrangements are not approved by the university, this may result in the student being unable to continue with their program of study or the staff member being unable to fulfil the inherent requirements of their role,\\\" the GU policy states.\", \"The policy applies to all staff and students, except for those studying fully online who agree not to attend campus or staff who have approval to work entirely from home.\", \"Griffith is believed to be the first university in Queensland to announce its own vaccine mandate.\", \"Vice chancellor Carolyn Evans told the ABC that Griffith University's decision followed a \\\"very thorough\\\" risk analysis.\", \"\\\"Universities are places where thousands of people come every day, they congregate in classrooms together, and then they split and go to different groups to libraries or to cafes, and then they go out to suburbs all over Queensland,\\\" she said.\", \"Professor Evans said she thought \\\"it would be simpler, in a number of ways\\\" if there was a public health mandate that applied across the university and TAFE sectors, similar to the one announced for schools and early childhood centres.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The Queensland vice chancellors have written to the government to encourage and support them to think about whether a public health mandate that covers universities and a requirement to be vaccinated, would be a good step \\u2026 and we'll rely on the Chief Health Officer and the advice the government receives on this front,\\\" she said.\", \"A spokesman from the Premier's office said it was a matter for the Queensland's Chief Health Officer.\"]","href_hash":"46a34ca6592c11ecaa64197d83808c5e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"46a34ca6592c11ecaa64197d83808c5e"}},
