This should have been evaluated better, Horsley said.\", \"When the SIS found out about offending by the associate, they told police verbally - a lawful disclosure, the review said - but then became worried about \\\"the impact any police action might have on the target's behaviour and any consequential prejudice to the Service's operation\\\".\", \"While that decision was robust, \\\"it made no attempt to work with police to identify how the anticipated risk could be mitigated\\\".\", \"In the other two incidents, despite the offending seeming to become more serious, the SIS did not report or disclose it to police. It was entitled to make this call, though the analysis should have been better.\", \"The offending was \\\"not its prime concern\\\", and it would have helped if the SIS's lawyers had been filled in to add their view to the intelligence analysts.\", \"The agency now has a Standard Operating Procedure that includes assessing if a crime is, in fact, serious, specifies the records to keep and has some guidance around possible risks from disclosing information.\", \"The SIS has a lower bar to clear to get a warrant for surveillance, but to balance that lacks the enforcement powers of the police - so if the SIS was forced to tell police things, that would not be good, Horsley said.\", \"\\\"Enabling or obliging the service to disclose to police any and all information on crime - or even serious crime - incidentally obtained through intelligence operations would result in the police being more frequently supplied with information they could not lawfully acquire using their own powers.\", \"\\\"Discretion for the service means this occurs only exceptionally, subject to case-by-case assessment of the relative importance of the intelligence and law enforcement interests at stake.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"29c9ad7d613e11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"29c9ad7d613e11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
