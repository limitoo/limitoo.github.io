been declared forbidden for Muslims by the national council\\u00a0of Islamic scholars in Indonesia, as the popularity of digital currencies grows in the world's largest Muslim-majority country.\", \"During a recent\\u00a0online forum, Indonesia's quasi-governmental\\u00a0Ulama Council\\u00a0declared a fatwa, or\\u00a0a non-binding religious ruling, that cryptocurrency is haram \\u2014 forbidden under Islamic law.\", \"An Ulama is a Muslim scholar who is recognised as having specialised knowledge in Islam.\", \"According to Islamic law, a transaction should follow certain requirements, such as having a physical form and definite value.\", \"\\\"Cryptocurrency as currency is forbidden because it has elements of uncertainty, harm\\u00a0and doesn't meet the Islamic requirement according to Shariah [law],\\\" KH Asrorun Niam Sholeh, the council's head of religious decrees, said in the forum.\", \"However, Mr Sholeh added that although cryptocurrencies as a currency is forbidden, it could be traded as a commodity or digital assets if they meet requirements.\", \"The council\\u00a0has served as an authority on Shariah compliance in Indonesia, but they\\u00a0have\\u00a0been criticised\\u00a0for other controversial fatwa.\", \"In 2018, it issued a fatwa raising concerns about a\\u00a0measles-rubella vaccine due to it containing traces of pork and human cells.\", \"The
