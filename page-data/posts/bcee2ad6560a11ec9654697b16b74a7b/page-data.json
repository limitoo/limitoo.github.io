Costanzo was reportedly denied entry into the country due to his lack of proof of a negative COVID-19 test, according to CTV. He was arrested after agents were told by his passenger, a 16-year-old, that he had abducted and sexually assaulted her.\", \"Constanzo allegedly kidnapped the girl somewhere in Connecticut and kept her in the trunk of his 2007 Toyota Camry during a drive to Burlington, Vermont, according to a statement from the Vermont State Police. In Burlington, he stopped at a Maplefields convenience store off of Interstate 89 and had the girl, whose name has not been released to the public, move to the back seat of his car before continuing on to the border crossing near the town of Highgate Springs.\", \"The investigation into the alleged kidnapping and assault is being handled by Homeland Security Investigations with assistance from the Vermont State Police.
