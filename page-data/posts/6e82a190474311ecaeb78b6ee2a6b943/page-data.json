The action comes a week after he used his official social media accounts to circulate a video clip from a popular anime program altered to show a figure with Mr. Gosar\\u2019s face slashing the neck of another figure bearing the face of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York.\", \"It also showed his character swinging swords at Mr. Biden.\", \"\\u201cThat is an insult \\u2014 not only an endangerment of that member of Congress \\u2014 but an insult to the institution\\u201d of the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California told reporters on Tuesday. \\u201cWe cannot have members joking about murdering each other, as well as threatening the president of the United States.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gosar has not apologized and instead played down the video, claiming in a statement that it was \\u201ctruly a symbolic portrayal of a fight over immigration policy\\u201d and saying he would not \\u201cespouse violence or harm toward any member of Congress.\\u201d He has privately blamed aides for posting the video.\", \"\\u201cIt is a symbolic cartoon,\\u201d Mr. Gosar said in a statement. \\u201cIt is not real life.\\u201d\", \"In a separate interview with conservative media, Mr. Gosar said he and his office were \\u201ctrying to reach out to the younger generation that likes these anime.\\u201d\", \"House Republican leaders have not publicly condemned Mr. Gosar for the video, which surfaced as prominent members of the party have become increasingly tolerant of violent statements, and their core supporters have resorted to threats against lawmakers considered insufficiently loyal to the G.O.P. line.\", \"In the resolution scheduled for action on Wednesday, Democrats refer to Republicans\\u2019 inaction and draw a connection between Mr. Gosar\\u2019s video and the Capitol riot, stating that \\u201cdepictions of violence can foment actual violence and jeopardize the safety of elected officials, as witnessed in this chamber on Jan. 6, 2021.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gosar\\u2019s post is the latest in a series of controversies involving the sixth-term congressman, who occupies a bizarre corner of far-right internet culture. Mr. Gosar has emerged as the most prominent congressional ally of an alt-right white nationalist group called America First whose followers embrace the use of off-kilter, frequently ironic memes. For years, he has elevated a slew of conspiracy theories and falsehoods \\u2014 including that the 2020 presidential election was stolen \\u2014 and cultivated a hard-right online base as a result.\", \"He raised eyebrows in March after tweeting a meme featuring a man asking a prostitute to \\u201ctell everyone America First is inevitable,\\u201d the tagline of the white nationalist group.\", \"For Democrats, the animated video was the final straw.\", \"\\u201cThis was a vile, dangerous incitement to violence,\\u201d said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader. \\u201cI have not seen something so egregious in my 40 years of service in the Congress of the United States, and unfortunately it\\u2019s a pattern.\\u201d He said he wished Republican leaders would act to discipline Mr. Gosar on their own, but added, \\u201caction must be taken.\\u201d\", \"In the resolution, Democrats took Mr. Gosar to task for targeting Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, asserting that \\u201cviolence against women in politics is a global phenomenon meant to silence women and discourage them from seeking positions of authority and participating in public life, with women of color disproportionately impacted.\\u201d\", \"Republicans have said the Democratic majority has been setting a dangerous precedent by acting against individuals in the minority. Earlier this year, the Democratic-led House voted to strip Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, of her committee assignments after social media posts emerged from before her election in which she endorsed violence against Democrats in Congress.\", \"\\u201cIn future years, this precedent may be used to give the majority veto power over the minority\\u2019s committee assignments,\\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a dangerous, dark road for the institution to go down.\\u201d\", \"Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, has declined to publicly denounce the video, but told reporters on Tuesday that he has told lawmakers that he would not accept \\u201cany action or showing of a violence to another member.\\u201d Mr. McCarthy said he had called Mr. Gosar after the Arizona Republican posted the video, and noted that he had deleted the video after their call.\", \"The last time the House censured a lawmaker was in 2010, after a yearslong ethics investigation found Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, guilty of a litany of abuses including failing to pay his income taxes and misuse of his office to solicit campaign donations.\"]","href_hash":"6e82a190474311ecaeb78b6ee2a6b943"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6e82a190474311ecaeb78b6ee2a6b943"}},
