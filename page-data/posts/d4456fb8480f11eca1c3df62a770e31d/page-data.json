Digging deep into the celebrity-bio-musical barrel, there to squabble for pre-eminence with pop divas and Jersey boys, it may well win the prize as the tawdriest and least excusable wholesaling of a supposedly true story ever to belt its way to Broadway.\", \"I doubt that was the intention behind the show, which opened on Wednesday at the Longacre Theater after somehow surviving two disasters: the pandemic, which knocked it down in March 2020; and a filmed version for Netflix (\\u201cthe year\\u2019s most hysterically awful hate-watch,\\u201d wrote The Guardian) that did much the same thing earlier this fall. Still, it\\u2019s worth asking, as the poor woman\\u2019s corpse is forced to rise again, what its authors could possibly have been thinking.\", \"The cynical answer, as always, is money. The Princess of Wales, in her short life and long death, has been dragooned into any number of commercial entertainments, including memoirs by her household staff, thinly sourced biographies, a multiseason story line on \\u201cThe Crown\\u201d and, most recently, the movie \\u201cSpencer.\\u201d Whether middlebrow or low, these works reshape Diana to their own needs, borrowing her familiar, eventful yet unknowable story to sell mere gossip as relatable real-life tragedy.\", \"But at least none of those involved any of the following, as \\u201cDiana\\u201d counterfactually does: the title character getting jiggy with Mstislav Rostropovich to an electrified version of Bach\\u2019s first cello suite; Barbara Cartland, the romance novelist, lasciviously pawing Diana\\u2019s lover James Hewitt as he arrives half-naked on a horse; a man with AIDS consenting to have his photo taken with the princess by singing, \\u201cI may be unwell, but I\\u2019m handsome as hell\\u201d; and a sort of boxing match between the rivals for Prince Charles\\u2019s affections set to the words: \\u201cIt\\u2019s the thrilla in Manila but with Diana and Camilla!\\u201d\", \"I wish propriety would allow me to tell you as well about the song in which Diana and her butler, Paul Burrell, choose the low-cut, off-the-shoulder \\u201crevenge\\u201d dress she wears in response to Charles\\u2019s 1994 interview blaming the failure of their marriage on her. Only for turning a common vulgarity into an uncommon one could the number be regarded as clever.\", \"Yet these are merely the most extractable of the horrors that \\u201cDiana,\\u201d as directed by Christopher Ashley, has on display. The real problem is intrinsic, arising from the choice to tell the story in song at all. Musicals, like laws, are often compared to sausages: You don\\u2019t want to know what goes into them. In this case, you don\\u2019t want to know what comes out, either; if you care about Diana as a human being, or dignity as a concept, you will find this treatment of her life both aesthetically and morally mortifying.\", \"Granted, the authors did not make it easy on themselves. In choosing to cover the entire arc of her fame \\u2014 from 1980 to \\u201996, with an epilogue about her death tacked on \\u2014 they probably doomed themselves to the narrative scrawniness that makes the show so twitchy. (\\u201cSpencer\\u201d limits itself to three days in 1991.) Roughly, and I do mean roughly, Joe DiPietro\\u2019s book touches on Diana\\u2019s rise from meek kindergarten helper to surprise candidate for what one song calls \\u201cthe worst job in England,\\u201d to fairy-tale bride, to scorned wife, to doting mother, to England\\u2019s favorite royal, to unfaithful wretch, to carousing divorc\\u00e9e, to martyrdom and points beyond.\", \"Once you add songs into the mix \\u2014 and Diana (Jeanna de Waal) sings in 17 of them \\u2014 there\\u2019s no time for coherence, let alone subtlety. De Waal is left to embody each new incarnation of the character as quickly and superficially as she swaps William Ivey Long\\u2019s trick costumes, which could tell the story better on their own. They are, at any rate, wittier and sparklier than the score; with music by David Bryan of Bon Jovi, and lyrics by Bryan and DiPietro, the songs are cold and crass \\u2014 and so, not surprisingly, their Diana is, too.\", \"This is not just a matter of de Waal\\u2019s bravura yet resolutely unthrilling performance, but also of the framing. In her introductory number, looking back on her life from some point presumably after the divorce but before her death, Diana suggests that it was tactically valuable to be \\u201cunderestimated\\u201d \\u2014 a word that doesn\\u2019t scan as a lyric no matter how mercilessly the songwriters flog it. It doesn\\u2019t scan as an idea either; rather, it sets up Diana as a kind of English Evita, a schemer who triumphed, which is bizarre on both counts.\", \"Indeed, there is something seriously wrong with a Diana story whose most believable and sympathetic character is Camilla Parker Bowles. But other than the degrading \\u201cthrilla\\u201d scene, Camilla is mercifully underwritten, allowing Erin Davie room to find something human in her that the real Camilla never could.\", \"The other two central players have no such room. Roe Hartrampf\\u2019s Charles is basically a Prince of Wails, complaining bitterly and at the top of his voice for the entire show; Judy Kaye\\u2019s already one-note battleship of a performance as Queen Elizabeth II is further undercut by her popping up occasionally as Cartland \\u2014 Diana\\u2019s step-grandmother \\u2014 for supposed comic relief.\", \"Choices like these suggest that the authors simply did not know what tone to take and so took every one they could think of. Wanting us to engage with the story seriously, they nevertheless ham it up with randy grannies and cheesy catfights. Seeking to cover 16 years in little more than two hours, they condense or flat-out fictionalize with a wink. In this context, it counts as a kind of discretion that the portrait of Burrell as a trusted confidant (and dress wrangler) neglects to mention that he was later prosecuted for stealing from the princess\\u2019s estate \\u2014 a case hastily dropped after the Queen interceded \\u2014 and, for an encore, wrote a tacky best-selling memoir.\", \"Ashley\\u2019s staging follows suit, going for grandeur but, in its haste, reaching only the clamminess of farce. (The chilly sets are by David Zinn.) And in Kelly Devine\\u2019s bizarrely noncontextual choreography, the ensemble \\u2014 whether representing palace flunkies, Knightsbridge snobs or worshipful Dianaphiles \\u2014 performs the same frenzied gymnastics.\", \"Musicals are difficult and expensive. No one says they have to be serious, too. \\u201cThe Cher Show\\u201d and \\u201cJersey Boys,\\u201d among many others, would have been much better with less drummed-up significance. Nor will an insufficiency of craft and proportion necessarily sully a modest, invented tale like the one told in \\u201cMemphis,\\u201d the 2010 Tony Award winner from the \\u201cDiana\\u201d creative team.\", \"But if you decide to write a musical about a real woman, known worldwide, who died tragically while still a young mother, something more rigorous is demanded. \\u201cDiana,\\u201d though, is lazy and thus neither entertaining nor insightful; though audiences talk back to it at will, it\\u2019s not even campy fun. It\\u2019s just exploitative, doing to the Princess of Wales pretty much what the tabloid press \\u2014 let alone the monarchy \\u2014 did to her in the first place.\"]","href_hash":"d4456fb8480f11eca1c3df62a770e31d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d4456fb8480f11eca1c3df62a770e31d"}},
