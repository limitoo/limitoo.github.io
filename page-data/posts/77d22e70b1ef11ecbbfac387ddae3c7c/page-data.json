Analysis of the light will help scientists and policy makers better understand the health of targeted areas, from agriculture and forestry management to water quality.\", \"\\\"We have a separate image for each wavelength range, which we can then analyze,\\\" Sebastian Fischer, the mission manager, told Spaceflight Now. \\\"And we can detect, for example, if a plant does not have enough water, or if the plant is missing nutrients.\\\"\", \"Also on board the Falcon 9: \\\"CubeSats, microsats, picosats, non-deploying hosted payloads and an orbital transfer vehicle carrying spacecraft to be deployed at a later time,\\\" SpaceX said on its website.\", \"The mission began at 12:24 p.m. when the Falcon 9 rocket, using a first stage making its seventh flight, blasted off from pad 40 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\", \"Arcing away toward a polar orbit, the first stage boosted the rocket out of the lower atmosphere and then fell away as the second stage continued the climb to space.\", \"EnMAP was released after the first of three second-stage engine firings, drifting away on its own 14 minutes after liftoff. Two other smaller satellites then were released before two additional engine firings to fine tune the orbit for the rest of the payloads.\", \"The remaining satellites were released from a central dispenser atop the second stage starting about one hour and 15 minutes after launch.\", \"The launching marked SpaceX's fourth rideshare mission, a unique launch service that lets multiple small satellite owners and operators share space on a Falcon 9. Including a recent price hike blamed on inflation, the cost can be as low as $1.1 million for satellites weighing up to 440 pounds.\", \"SpaceX launched a record 143 satellites on its first rideshare mission in January 2021, 88 on its second mission last June and 105 on the Transporter 3 mission earlier this year. Based on growing demand, the company is now planning three rideshare missions per year.\", \"Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News. He covered 129 space shuttle missions, every interplanetary flight since Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune and scores of commercial and military launches. Based at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Harwood is a devoted amateur astronomer and co-author of \\\"Comm Check: The Final Flight of Shuttle Columbia.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"77d22e70b1ef11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"77d22e70b1ef11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
