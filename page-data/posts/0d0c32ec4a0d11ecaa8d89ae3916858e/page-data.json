Some of them were returned to the Paleontological Museum of the city of Caldera and the Chilean National Museum of Natural History.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936483/researchers-discover-shark-tooth.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Researchers at work in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, where remains of a giant shark were recently unearthed. </div>\", \"\\\"With this, we undoubtedly have one of the largest scientific collections of megalodon teeth in the world.\\\"\", \"How is it teeth from a marine animal were found in the middle of a desert?\", \"\\\"Because the sea level has changed over millions of years (marine transgression and regression),\\\" the expert said. \\\"This is visible not only in the abundant marine fossils found in sediments today, but also in the geomorphology of this part of the desert, where we can see natural esplanades, which are ancient marine terraces that testify to these different sea levels.\", \"\\\"In short, the sea has receded, but the ground has also risen as a result of earthquakes and subduction of plates, phenomena that we Chileans know and experience so well.\\\"\", \"Such finds are nothing new; English naturalist and evolution theorist Charles Darwin reported having found some megalodon teeth during his trip to Chile in 1835, Quilodran said, while recent discoveries had put the total number of different shark species found in the area to 25.\", \"\\\"In the case of sharks, it is not only megalodon; we recently found a new sawshark record for the area, which adds up to more than 25 different species of shark that have been found in the sector.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936484/newly-discovered-tooth.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">One of the teeth from an extinct megalodon shark recently found in northern Chile. </div>\", \"A lot of these discoveries were apparently due to sheer luck. \\\"Many of these findings are fortuitous and did not respond to systematic scientific activity,\\\" Quilodran said.\", \"But future discoveries will likely be subject to more rigorous planning, due to the recent creation of the Atacama Paleontology and Natural History Research and Advancement Corp.\", \"The implications of the discoveries of megalodon teeth in the Atacama Desert are huge for science, with Quilodran saying: \\\"The unusual abundance of megalodon remains in this part of the desert opens up expectations for new knowledge about many aspects of ancient life regarding this remarkable species of shark.\", \"\\\"For example, what and how did it eat? New estimates of body size, growth speed, whether it was solitary or gregarious, internal temperature and paleo-environmental data, are among many other topics that may be addressed.\", \"\\\"For its part, the Bahia Inglesa site also has an abundance of remains of bony fish, marine mammals, birds and even reptiles, and all the research potential to understand the evolution of a great diversity of different lineages of marine vertebrates is gigantic.\\\"\", \"The recently discovered megalodon teeth will eventually end up in a museum, where the public will be able to view them.\", \"Might the megalodon still exist?
