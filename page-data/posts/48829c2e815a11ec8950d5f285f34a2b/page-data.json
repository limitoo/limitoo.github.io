Heavy snow continued through the afternoon, with wind gusts of more than 70 miles per hour in some locations, creating whiteout conditions.\", \"Indeed, the tempest\\u2019s intensity and drifting snow made even measuring the accumulation difficult, though the storm was shaping up to be the biggest of the season in some regions, and maybe one of the biggest in decades. Mr. Field said up to 30 inches of snow was possible in coastal areas, potentially smashing a 2003 record for Boston of more than 27 inches.\", \"The wicked weather may have also claimed more than one life. In Nassau County, east of New York City, police were investigating the death of an elderly woman found dead inside her car at around 2:45 a.m., with at least one of the car\\u2019s windows open. And in Toms River, N.J., a man went into cardiac arrest and died while operating a snowblower, according to the Ocean County sheriff, Michael Mastronardy.\", \"The intense storm was characterized as a \\u201cbomb cyclone,\\u201d in which barometric pressure drops rapidly over 24 hours, producing high winds. As storms like this one move over coastal waters, they pick up moisture, resulting in heavy snow.\", \"The storm\\u2019s speed and ferocity, predicted for days, were being felt up and down the Interstate 95 corridor. There was significant snowfall in Southern cities like Asheville, N.C., and bitter cold was predicted overnight in locales like Charleston, S.C., part of a Southern cold snap.\", \"There was coastal flooding on Saturday afternoon on Cape Cod and in the streets of Nantucket, where gusts more akin to those in a tropical storm were felt. Nantucket officials and American Red Cross volunteers had opened an emergency warming shelter at the high school as power outages persisted and temperatures dipped. Emergency centers were also open on the Cape.\", \"Forecasters cautioned that storm would continue to bring snow and strong winds into the evening before heading offshore, where it could create 30-foot swells for any boat unlucky enough to be caught in open water. Tides were also predicted to rise on shore on Saturday evening, raising the specter of additional flooding.\", \"In a late-afternoon briefing on Saturday, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts said his state was \\u201cnot quite out of the woods,\\u201d noting that travel conditions were treacherous and that road cleanup, removal of snow and restoring of power could take several days.\", \"Blizzard conditions \\u2014 the blinding combination of snow and wind \\u2014 were already confirmed in at least four states, including Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut.\", \"In Boston, the storm was drawing comparisons to the Blizzard of \\u201978, which buried the city in more than two feet of snow and caused serious flooding. Boston residents seemed to be holing up or battening down, though one group of about a dozen diners could be seen brunching \\u2014 and drinking mimosas \\u2014 at Frenchie, a restaurant on Tremont Street, in spite of the weather.\", \"One of the bistro\\u2019s employees, Vanessa Fitzgerald, 39, said she had come to work despite a harrowing drive there with her husband that morning. \\u201cIt was nerve-racking,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI was like, \\u2018I\\u2019m going to die.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"She added, \\u201cI think I\\u2019m going to sleep here tonight.\\u201d\", \"Those out in the weather likened it to a snow globe, with winds twirling falling snowflakes while taking fresh powder off rooftops and cars and adding it to the swirl.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s hard, it\\u2019s tiring; when the wind hits your face, it hurts,\\u201d said Eddy Sasso, who was motoring a four-wheeler with a plow on the front to clear sidewalks in Queens and who had ice visible in his goatee and eyebrows. He had been at it for 12 hours, he said, and would stop \\u201cwhenever it stops.\\u201d\", \"That said, New York City seemed to have dodged the brunt of the storm, even as bands of snow and wind clobbered the Jersey Shore, eastern Long Island and Connecticut, and points north. By late afternoon, Islip, N.Y., on Long Island, had gotten more than two feet, the most of any location in the tristate area, followed in short order by Groton, Conn., and Bayville, N.J.\", \"In Rhode Island, travel restrictions were in place until Saturday evening, with large trucks, except those carrying emergency supplies, barred from driving on all roads. Similar steps were taken in Connecticut, where Gov. Ned Lamont said some \\u201cterrible accidents\\u201d had occurred involving tractor-trailers. He pleaded with residents to stay off the road but praised their hardiness.\", \"\\u201cThis is New England,\\u201d he told CNN. \\u201cWe are prepared for this.\\u201d\", \"Governors in New Jersey and New York had preemptively declared states of emergency in expectation of the storm, even as airlines canceled nearly 2,000 flights at three major hubs \\u2014 Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport and Boston Logan International Airport \\u2014 according to FlightAware, which tracks aviation data.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re in throes of this nor\\u2019easter \\u2014 it is a serious one,\\u201d Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York said at a storm briefing on Saturday morning, adding that the cold blast accompanying the storm, and the potential for loss of power, could be life-threatening. \\u201cYou cannot have people in their homes without heat for any length of time.\\u201d\", \"Facing a major weather event during his first month in office, Mayor Eric Adams of New York City warned residents to stay inside. \\u201cIt\\u2019s best to be off the roads,\\u201d he said, standing on a blustery sidewalk on Tiffany Street in the Bronx. \\u201cBe careful. Bundle up. Good day to stay at home if you don\\u2019t have to go out.\\u201d\", \"That said, some city residents viewed the Saturday snow day as a treat, with dog owners taking their pets to a pillowy Central Park for walks. \\u201cShe loves the snow,\\u201d said Nancy Nelson, 65, an Upper West Side resident, who was with Callie, her 8-year-old dog. \\u201cShe\\u2019s already belly-crawled all the way across the street.\\u201d\", \"Those who dared drive, however, were often facing treacherous conditions, even with lighter weekend traffic. For the most part, the subways were running regularly, though the Long Island Rail Road suspended its service midmorning and service was limited on the Metro North Railroad. Amtrak canceled all of its high-speed Acela trains between New York and Washington, as well as its routes between New York and Boston.\", \"Even some professional drivers were daunted. In Long Island City, Jeff Lopez, who had been making fuel deliveries since 3 a.m., said the condition of the roads was bad enough that he was knocking off early because of the slippery conditions. \\u201cIt\\u2019s pretty bad out there,\\u201d he said.\", \"Forecasters said that the storm\\u2019s speed and accompanying cold \\u2014 subzero wind chills were reported across the Northeast \\u2014 might lessen the potential for loss of power, noting that the conditions produced lighter, more powdery snow that was less likely to weigh down trees and power lines. Areas around Bangor, Maine, were predicted to experience severe cold, including wind chills as low as 20 below zero.\", \"The storm could also be a boon for ski areas in the Northeast, many of which have not had enough snow this year to fully open their trails. Among them was Mount Sunapee in New Hampshire, where snow-making had been a challenge because of warmer temperatures. Sunapee had received about six inches by midday.\", \"Still, the conditions were often unpleasant for many who dared to venture out. In places like suburban Monmouth County, N.J., with snow drifts deeper than a foot and whipping wind, residents were essentially homebound. Conditions were even worse near the Atlantic, where the Weather Service said that nearly 16 inches of snow had fallen in some areas by around 8 a.m., making travel \\u201cextremely dangerous.\\u201d\", \"Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey said his state had dispatched 3,000 pieces of equipment to clear roads and aid travelers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a statewide event, but the shore is getting clobbered,\\u201d he said on WCBS-TV, adding that the cleanup \\u201cwon\\u2019t be overnight.\\u201d\", \"On the eastern end of Long Island, residents were trying to soldier on, even as the snow continued to accumulate. Jens Lester, 78, a lifelong resident of Amagansett, said he had seen blizzards like this one before but remained worried about the power going out, because his generator, he discovered yesterday, wouldn\\u2019t start up.\", \"Most winters, Mr. Lester said, he would be in Florida or the Caribbean, but the pandemic had made traveling difficult.\", \"\\u201cI wish I was there now,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI think a lot of people do.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"48829c2e815a11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"48829c2e815a11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
