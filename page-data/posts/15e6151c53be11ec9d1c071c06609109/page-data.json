Blinken said on Thursday that President Biden would \\u201clikely\\u201d speak directly with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia \\u201cin the near future,\\u201d as part of a frantic diplomatic effort to head off what Western officials fear could be a Russian invasion of Ukraine.\", \"Mr. Blinken spoke to reporters in Stockholm on Thursday, shortly after meeting with Russia\\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, on the sidelines of an annual meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\", \"Mr. Blinken said he had communicated \\u201cclearly and directly\\u201d to Mr. Lavrov American concerns about unusual troop movements and other menacing actions by Moscow that appear to presage a Russian invasion of its neighbor, a former Soviet republic whose independence and Western ties Mr. Putin resents.\", \"Mr. Blinken warned that the United States would work with allies \\u201cto impose severe costs and consequences on Russia if it takes further aggressive action against Ukraine.\\u201d He said those could include \\u201chigh-impact economic measures that we\\u2019ve refrained from taking in the past,\\u201d but declined to offer more details.\", \"Mr. Lavrov came bearing his own threats. Echoing recent warnings by Mr. Putin, Mr. Lavrov said that \\u201cdrawing Ukraine into the geopolitical games of the United States against the background of the deployment of NATO forces in the immediate vicinity of our borders will have the most serious consequences,\\u201d according to a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry after his meeting with Mr. Blinken.\", \"Mr. Lavrov repeated Mr. Putin\\u2019s demand for \\u201clong-term security guarantees\\u201d on Russia\\u2019s western borders, which the Russian president on Wednesday defined as agreements that Ukraine will never join NATO and that the alliance\\u2019s weapons systems will not be based there. Mr. Lavrov said that otherwise, Russia was prepared to take \\u201cretaliatory measures to correct the military-strategic balance,\\u201d according to the statement.\", \"As Russia speaks increasingly of threats from NATO, Mr. Blinken has warned that Russia might fabricate a provocation to justify military action against Ukraine. On Thursday he told reporters that \\u201cdespite a massive Russian disinformation campaign, Ukraine in no way poses a threat to Russia.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe only threat is that of renewed Russian aggression towards Ukraine,\\u201d Mr. Blinken said.\", \"Neither Mr. Blinken nor the White House provided more detail on any Biden-Putin conversation. Kremlin officials have suggested the possibility for days, but Mr. Blinken\\u2019s remark was the first clear indication from Washington that Mr. Biden was taking the idea seriously.\", \"The two presidents met in person for the first time in June amid a similar state of alarm about a potential Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine, where Russian forces have long backed a pro-Moscow separatist insurgency. Russia annexed Ukraine\\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 in a move the U.S. still does not recognize.\", \"Russian forces partially withdrew shortly before Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin met in Geneva, leading some analysts to suggest that Mr. Putin had manufactured the crisis in part to secure a meeting with the new American president.\", \"Biden officials said at the time that the summit\\u2019s goal was in large measure to regain a more stable and predictable footing with the Kremlin. But the relationship remains poisoned.\", \"In brief remarks to reporters before meeting privately with Mr. Blinken, Mr. Lavrov also alluded to a tit-for-tat with the United States involving diplomatic staff. On Wednesday, Russia ordered American diplomats who had been in Moscow for more than three years to fly out of the country by Jan. 31. The move came days after Russia\\u2019s ambassador to Washington said that 27 Russian diplomats and their families were being forced to leave the United States by the end of January.\", \"In a daily briefing on Thursday, the State Department\\u2019s deputy spokeswoman, Jalina Porter, said the Russian diplomats must leave the country under a policy that limits them to three-year stays. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s happening is not an expulsion,\\u201d she said, adding that new diplomats may take their place.\", \"The U.S. diplomatic presence in Russia has dramatically reduced over the past few years amid rising tensions between Washington and Moscow. The State Department closed its last two consulates in Russia a year ago, citing a cap on diplomatic employees imposed by Moscow after a round of U.S. sanctions in 2018.\", \"Even as he managed the crisis along Ukraine\\u2019s eastern border, Mr. Blinken was also managing diplomacy related to Iran\\u2019s nuclear program, as a new round of talks continued in Vienna with little apparent progress. The talks are aimed at restoring the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which President Donald J. Trump abandoned in 2018.\", \"Mr. Blinken fielded an unusual call on Thursday from the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, who told him that Iran was engaging in \\u201cnuclear blackmail\\u201d and called for \\u201can immediate cessation of negotiations\\u201d in Vienna.\", \"Mr. Blinken downplayed the call, saying that he and Mr. Bennett had a positive conversation and agreed on the goal of preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.\", \"He added that Iran\\u2019s recent rhetoric and steps to accelerate its nuclear program \\u201cdon\\u2019t give us a lot of cause for optimism,\\u201d but said \\u201cit is not too late for Iran to reverse course.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"15e6151c53be11ec9d1c071c06609109"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"15e6151c53be11ec9d1c071c06609109"}},
