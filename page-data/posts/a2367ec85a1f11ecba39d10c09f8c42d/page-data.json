The homeowners association then decided to hire the pest company to remove 25 geese.\", \"Rolando Calzadilla, the company's owner, said he gave the geese bread laced with sedatives, but a loud car startled the birds, causing them to fly off. While Calzadilla was able to recover 15 of the birds and euthanize them elsewhere, ten fell into the lake nearby and drowned. He said he never meant for any cruelty, according to Local 10 News.\", \"\\\"It was for them to remain on land, fall asleep, pick them up and take them away and then humanely euthanize them,\\\" Calzadilla said, Local 10 News reported.\", \"Calzadilla said that while he was retrieving the birds, residents who took notice of him charged at him and were yelling and screaming. He said \\\"the situation was out of control,\\\" and had to call the police for help.\", \"\\\"Everyone hates the dog catcher in the neighborhood. It was just a bad situation,\\\" he told the South Florida Sun Sentinel.\", \"Residents that enjoy the geese and name them are \\\"never, never the same people\\\" who have bad experiences with them, Calzadilla said.\", \"According to Local 10 News, the homeowners association sent a letter to residents, saying, \\\"...The Associations contract with Pest Wildlife Pro required that the vendor remove the birds by legal means in compliance with all Federal, State and local laws and ordinances.
