In 2000, Michael Skakel was charged with her murder. He was convicted in 2002 and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. After spending more than a decade in prison for the murder, in 2013 a judge granted Skakel a new trial, saying his first attorney failed to adequately represent him. In 2018, the Connecticut Supreme Court vacated his murder conviction and ordered a new trial. But in 2020, prosecutors said they would not retry him.\", \"Now, for the first time since Martha Moxley was murdered, her childhood friends Richard Burns and Tori Holland are speaking together to \\\"48 Hours\\\" correspondent Erin Moriarty.\", \"\\\"This little girl \\u2026 this cute, little amazing girl was murdered brutally by somebody.

Mickey is no amateur when it comes to television.\", \"Erin Moriarty: What's the motive for Michael Skakel killing Martha Moxley?\", \"Lynne Tuohy: The only motive, really, is jealous rage over the attention she was showing Tommy Skakel.\", \"In fact, in that same book proposal for his autobiography, Michael wrote: \\\"I wanted her to be my girlfriend.\\\"\", \"Dorthy Moxley (2000): I think Martha just rebuffed him. \\u2026 She could have been flirting with Tommy, and maybe that made him angry.\", \"At trial, prosecutor Jonathan Benedict began with discrediting Michael's alibi that he had gone for that ride to his cousin's house around the time of Martha's murder.
