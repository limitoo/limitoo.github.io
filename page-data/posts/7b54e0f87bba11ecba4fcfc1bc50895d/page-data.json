Shares of retailers have been under pressure for the past several years, while those of online sites have, until recently, been soaring.\", \"Kohl\\u2019s is already under pressure to improve its share price. The activist firm Macellum Advisors, which has a 5 percent stake in Kohl\\u2019s, urged the retailer in a letter last Tuesday to explore strategic alternatives, including a sale. That was after it raised similar criticisms over Kohl\\u2019s stock performance last year.\", \"The quick procession of Macellum\\u2019s letter and the consortium\\u2019s offer may be the beginning of a dance to put pressure on Kohl\\u2019s to consider a sale \\u2014 or otherwise quickly boost its share price. In response to Macellum\\u2019s letter, Kohl\\u2019s said this past week that it was confident in its board and would \\u201caggressively pursue the best interests of all shareholders.\\u201d\", \"Kohl\\u2019s, based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., and founded in 1962, is a department store focused on casual wear, home wares and sporting goods. Unlike other retailers like Nordstrom, Kohl\\u2019s stores are frequently found in smaller shopping centers, rather than malls. That has made its real estate more valuable as malls have fallen on hard times.\", \"A key question will be whether the Starboard consortium will secure the necessary funds to finance the bid, particularly given challenges posed by past leveraged buyouts of retailers, like Toys \\u201cR\\u201d Us, Payless and Neiman Marcus. Those deals saddled the retailers with debt, leaving them unable to make the necessary investments as e-commerce transformed the retail landscape. All three were eventually unable to make their loan payments and filed for bankruptcy. Both Neiman Marcus and Payless emerged from bankruptcy, while Toys \\u201cR\\u201d Us ultimately liquidated.\", \"Shares of Kohl\\u2019s have risen less than 4 percent over the past year, giving it a market capitalization of around $6.5 billion. The offer, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, would value the retailer at $64 a share, 37 percent premium to its closing price of $46.84 on Friday.\", \"Acacia Research Corporation, which is leading the bid, has been backed by Starboard since 2019. Starboard has helped Acacia raise a \\u201csignificant\\u201d amount of equity capital to fund its offer, one of the people familiar with the discussions said. Acacia has also received a letter of confidence from a bank, this person said, stating that the bank believes it can help assemble part of the debt necessary for the transaction. Acacia is also in talks with a real estate firm that would sell off part of Kohl\\u2019s real estate to help fund the bid, this person said.\", \"Both people who spoke about the matter requested anonymity because the offer is confidential. A spokeswoman for Kohl\\u2019s did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\", \"Even with financing uncertainty, the offer could put pressure on Kohl\\u2019s since Macellum has threatened to nominate directors to Kohl\\u2019s board \\u201cif the status quo persists.\\u201d Macellum criticized Kohl\\u2019s in its letter for \\u201cmismanaging the business and failing to implement necessary operational, financial and strategic improvements.\\u201d It is pressuring Kohl\\u2019s to consider carving out its e-commerce business.\", \"Macellum struck a settlement with the retailer last April that included the addition of three new directors to its board. Shares in Kohl\\u2019s have fallen more than 20 percent since then, as supply chain challenges have snarled the industry.\", \"\\u201cWe have continued to engage with Macellum since the settlement and are disappointed with the path they have taken and the unfounded speculation in their announcement and letter,\\u201d Kohl\\u2019s said in response to Macellum.\", \"Kohl\\u2019s has argued that its efforts to invest in its online and active wear business are underway \\u2014 and getting traction. In November, it reported that its third-quarter sales had jumped 16 percent. In December 2020, it announced a partnership with Sephora to help draw more shoppers to its stores. It\\u2019s active wear business, which it is working to make more inclusive to all sizes, now makes up a little more than a quarter of its sales.\"]","href_hash":"7b54e0f87bba11ecba4fcfc1bc50895d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7b54e0f87bba11ecba4fcfc1bc50895d"}},
