Plus, a genius teacher tip for resolving conflicts.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-01-12T11:19:29.000Z","content":"[\"Today, Chicago classrooms reopen as Los Angeles and other districts struggle to test students for the coronavirus. And a federal lawsuit accuses 16 top private colleges and universities of price-fixing on financial aid.\", \"Chicago schools reopened today after the teachers\\u2019 union and the city struck a deal. Students are learning again for the first time since last Tuesday when the district canceled school after teachers voted to stop reporting to their classrooms.\", \"City officials said the deal included provisions for additional testing, along with metrics that would close schools with major outbreaks.\", \"Union leaders said the agreement was imperfect but necessary given the conditions teachers face during the pandemic.\", \"And parents were frustrated, no matter where they fell on the reopening questions. They had to race to find child care and wrestle with the uncertainty.\", \"\\u201cI feel like there\\u2019s a lot of political stuff going on,\\u201d Aaron Wise, who has two children in high school, said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard, the situation is difficult. But it really shouldn\\u2019t be that difficult.\\u201d\", \"But extensive testing may be tough to put into effect. Among the leading issues:\", \"Rapid antigen tests are in limited supply.\", \"The tests, which can be administered at home, are central to the test-to-stay strategy.\", \"But supply chain issues and weather problems can worsen shortages. In California, for instance, storms over the winter break destroyed a million test kits that were meant for schools.\", \"And tests can be faulty. In Florida this month, an attempt to supply tests to teachers in Broward County turned up expired kits.\", \"Many districts have also chosen an opt-in approach.\", \"That means they\\u2019re only testing a select group of students whose parents agree to have them tested \\u2014\\u00a0that is, those who may already come from more virus-conscious homes.\", \"In Seattle, only about 14,000 of the district\\u2019s 50,000 students and 7,800 employees showed up when classes were canceled for testing.\", \"Worryingly, about one in 25 tested positive. By Monday, two Seattle schools were closed from staff shortages and infections, and the district was contemplating a return to remote classes.\", \"Parents may not understand how to use the tests.\", \"Take Chicago. The district \\u2014 the nation\\u2019s third-largest \\u2014 sent out 150,000 or so mail-in P.C.R. tests over break.\", \"Most were never returned. And of the 40,000 or so tests that were mailed in, most produced invalid results.\", \"Lines can also be really, really long.\", \"Parents may have to take time off work \\u2014 time they may not have to spare.\", \"In Seattle, some children waited for hours, some in a driving rain. Los Angeles families also lined up for blocks at school sites for much of last week to receive a swab.\", \"Public health experts say few districts are testing enough, and strategically enough, particularly in the wake of Omicron.\", \"District data from Los Angeles showed that during the week ending Monday, 66,000 tests out of about 458,000 tests had come back positive. That\\u2019s a positivity rate of more than 15 percent \\u2014 lower than county, state and national averages, but still high enough to cause alarm.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m worried, like a lot of parents,\\u201d Amanda Santos, whose 7-year-old attends first grade, said.\", \"Despite the high positivity rate, Los Angeles, the second-largest district in the country, forged ahead with plans to open classrooms for in-person learning on Tuesday. Santos said she was reassured by the testing policy.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re not letting anybody who has a positive test, or who doesn\\u2019t test, on campus,\\u201d she said. \\u201cSo I feel secure about that.\\u201d\", \"And tests can be expensive.\", \"Since 2020, Los Angeles has had one of the nation\\u2019s most ambitious testing programs.\", \"But the initiative \\u2014 which encompasses more than 600,000 students and staffers \\u2014 relies on P.C.R. tests provided for about $12 apiece by a start-up that is contractually obligated to provide overnight results.\", \"The district\\u2019s cost per test is about half what the state negotiated for its tests with another vendor. But it\\u2019s still spending about $5 million per week on testing, the vice president of the school board said.\", \"A new federal lawsuit is accusing 16 elite private colleges and universities \\u2014 including M.I.T., the University of Chicago and many of the Ivy League schools \\u2014 of conspiring to reduce financial aid through a price-fixing cartel.\", \"The allegations hinge on a decades-old antitrust exemption, which permits these universities to collaborate on financial aid formulas \\u2014\\u00a0provided that they do not consider a student\\u2019s ability to pay in the admissions process. (You might know that as \\u201cneed blind\\u201d admissions.)\", \"The suit claims that nine of the schools are not actually need-blind because for many years, they have found ways to consider some applicants\\u2019 ability to pay. Because the schools collaborate in an organization called the 568 Presidents Group, the suit says, the actions of nine affect all 16.\", \"One claim: The University of Pennsylvania and Vanderbilt have considered the financial needs of wait-listed applicants.\", \"Another claim: Other schools award \\u201cspecial treatment to the children of wealthy\\u201d donors, which, given the limited number of spots, hurts students needing financial aid.\", \"And a conclusion: The suit claims that the colleges have overcharged an estimated 170,000 students who were eligible for financial aid over nearly two decades.\", \"\\u201cPrivileging the wealthy and disadvantaging the financially needy are inextricably linked,\\u201d the suit said. \\u201cThey are two sides of the same coin.\\u201d\", \"Schools across the country are shifting to temporary remote learning as staff members report testing positive or needing to quarantine because of exposure.\", \"Henry Garc\\u00eda, a fifth-grade teacher at a 107th Street Elementary, a public school in South Central Los Angeles, uses Jenga to help his students talk about difficult issues.\", \"\\u201cIt very quickly gets very serious,\\u201d he said of the block-stacking game. \\u201cAll of that makes it easy to get distracted and become very present in the game.\\u201d\", \"Recently, he said, two of his students had a falling out. At one point, they both said they were done with their friendship, which had once been quite close.\", \"\\u201cI thought: \\u2018How can I help heal this?\\u2019\\u201d he said.\", \"So he brought out the Jenga. Their annoyance melted as the tower quivered. Soon, the two started laughing. The old friendship shone through their frustration.\", \"\\u201cOnce I realized they were having fun, that\\u2019s when I brought up the issue,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI asked, \\u2018Hey, what really happened?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Jenga, though, is just the first step. Garc\\u00eda tries to guide his students in their conversations, too. He helps them listen to one another and then reflect each other\\u2019s positions. At the end, he said, the students had reconciled.\", \"\\u201cThey were just so focused on the game and they didn\\u2019t want to lose, so they kind of let their guard down just enough to be in a space to talk a little bit more openly,\\u201d Garc\\u00eda said.\", \"But he also said there was nothing special about Jenga \\u2014 any game would do just fine. The important thing, he said, is to create \\u201ca more informal, less serious setting where we\\u2019re able to play, have fun \\u2014 and also talk.\\u201d\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing.
