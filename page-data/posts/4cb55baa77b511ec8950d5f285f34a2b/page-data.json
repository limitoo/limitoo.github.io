He has been identified as Malik Faisal Akram, a 44-year-old British national. Police did not comment on the motive, but White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called the incident an \\\"act of terrorism\\\" and an \\\"act of antisemitism.\\\"\", \"The man took hostages during services that were being broadcast on a livestream.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It was terrifying,\\\" Cytron-Walker said. \\\"It was overwhelming and we're still processing.
