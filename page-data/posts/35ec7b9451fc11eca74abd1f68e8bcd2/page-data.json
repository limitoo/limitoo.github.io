Jimi Hendrix\\u2019s rendition of \\u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\\u201d redefined patriotism during the Vietnam War.

He\\u2019ll revisit the protest songs that defined moments of change \\u2014 and explore the music that subscribers say defines this uncertain moment. He\\u2019ll also welcome musicians from across three different generations for a gathering filled with music, conversation and ideas.\", \"Take a virtual front-row seat as Morello welcomes Jackson Browne, the voice of change for legions of baby boomers; Nadya Tolokonnikova of Pussy Riot, a band known for its potent mix of punk art and activism (which eventually led to its imprisonment by the Russian government); and the 11-year-old drumming prodigy, Nandi Bushell, who is already making waves on stages with the Foo Fighters and in songs that call for urgent action on climate change.\", \"R.S.V.P. above for \\u201cThe Sound of Activism with Tom Morello\\u201d on Dec. 15.
