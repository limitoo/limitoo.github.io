recontest his seat in Victoria.\", \"Mr Hunt\\u00a0said \\\"it was time to come home\\\" and he was retiring to spend more time with his family.\", \"He said in leaving politics, he wanted a woman to replace him as the Liberal candidate in his coastal Victorian seat.\\u00a0\", \"Mr Hunt was first elected into the seat of Flinders in 2001, three years after working as a senior adviser to then-opposition leader Alexander Downer and heading Australia's electoral mission to Cambodia in 1998.\", \"Before becoming Health Minister in 2017, Mr Hunt served as industry, innovation and science minister and before that the environment minister\\u00a0\\u2014 a role that saw him selected as the first Best Minister in the World\\u00a0at the World Government Summit in 2016.\", \"He was appointed to the\\u00a0Health and Sport portfolios\\u00a0under Malcolm Turnbull's leadership, after Sussan Ley resigned as minister for both amid an expenses scandal.\", \"Mr Hunt's retirement\\u00a0comes nearly two years after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw him\\u00a0play a key role in the government's evolving response to\\u00a0an unprecedented and rapidly changing situation.\", \"From sourcing extra PPE to bolster our national stockpiles in the early months of outbreaks, to later being part of the team\\u00a0responsible for the coordination and rollout of COVID vaccines, Mr Hunt has been\\u00a0part of the biggest decisions around the management of the pandemic.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/2960c491ffa745709d7efc5f7aa91e7e\\\"

special powers under the Biosecurity Act to put in place advice from the Chief Medical Officer \\u2014\\u00a0including to close the borders and ban Australians from leaving the country.\", \"Mr Hunt\\u00a0and the government\\u00a0were heavily criticised last year when he signed off on new rules\\u00a0to ban Australian citizens from returning from India while it was experiencing a national COVID outbreak.\", \"People were threatened with hefty fines and potential jail time for breaching the rules, which were described as \\\"immoral\\\" and \\\"un-Australian\\\".\", \"This year, as the attention shifted from the pandemic response to vaccination efforts, Mr Hunt's role in brokering deals with global companies to secure vaccines was scrutinised.\", \"He hit back at\\u00a0claims from the opposition that he was slow to speak to representatives from Pfizer about forging a deal for vaccine doses and so was to blame for the delays in the\\u00a0rollout caused by a lack of supply.\",

controversies.\", \"He, along with other cabinet ministers, offered his resignation from Cabinet\\u00a0after voting in favour of Peter Dutton during a leadership spill against Mr Turnbull.\", \"The offer was not accepted and he ultimately remained as Health Minister under Scott Morrison's leadership.\", \"During that spill he also unsuccessfully tried for the deputy Liberal leadership, losing to long-time friend and now-Treasurer Josh Frydenberg.\", \"Mr Hunt also publicly apologised to the Mayor of Katherine in 2018 for using \\\"strong language\\\" during a meeting between the pair, and conceded\\u00a0it should not have taken him almost six months to say sorry.\", \"Fay Miller\\u00a0said Mr Hunt swore and pointed his finger in her face during a conversation, describing it as the most unprofessional interaction she had ever had with a person as senior as him.\"]","href_hash":"e1bf3d60532a11ecb453c7e97142e4fd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e1bf3d60532a11ecb453c7e97142e4fd"}},
