The opponent, the Arizona Cardinals, humiliated the Rams two months ago on their own field, and the circumstances were aligned for it to happen again.\", \"If it did, Kroenke would have seen his team suffer four prime time embarrassments in six weeks. That would have sparked more chatter of whether the bold choices his lieutenants made of shunning draft picks for stars were justified.\", \"At least for now, those questions can wait.\", \"The short-handed Rams (9-4) defeated the Cardinals, 30-23, on Monday night, quelling a mounting narrative that the team was unable to beat quality opponents despite boasting a roster that resembles the N.F.L. version of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Cardinals (10-3) still lead the N.F.C. West, but they relinquished the conference\\u2019s No. 1 seed. And as the playoffs approach, the result escalated the race for the division.\", \"\\u201cWe want to continue to be totally in and completely present, enjoy this, but let\\u2019s keep building,\\u201d Rams Coach Sean McVay said. \\u201cYou want to continue to be relevant, but you also want to make sure that you\\u2019re improving so that if you do give yourself an opportunity to play after the 17-game regular season you\\u2019re playing your best ball.\\u201d\", \"Los Angeles stood firm when Arizona recovered an onside kick with 34 seconds remaining in regulation. Instead of spiking the ball to preserve time after a completion, Kyler Murray took the snap, a questionable move that he said was a miscommunication between him and the offensive line. Defenders forced him to scramble, and he soon fell in Aaron Donald\\u2019s waiting arms for a sack. Donald, seemingly exhausted from a stellar performance, raised his hands and took off his helmet as he left the field.\", \"Donald secured three sacks, two of them in the first half. The Rams needed a spectacular outing from him and all their starters amid the absences. Donald said Ramsey texted him that morning about the positive coronavirus test. The Rams placed Ramsey and tight end Tyler Higbee on the Covid-19 list on Monday after adding running back Darrell Henderson, right tackle Rob Havenstein and the backup cornerback Dont\\u2019e Deayon over the weekend. That caused the team to hustle and adjust.\", \"\\u201cI think the guys that we needed to step up and come in and play well did that,\\u201d said quarterback Matthew Stafford, who threw for 287 yards and three touchdowns. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a testament to our coaching staff and then our players going out there and executing.\\u201d\", \"On a large stage, the onus fell on Stafford, who had struggled in similar situations, and on Snead\\u2019s flashy midseason acquisitions, Von Miller and Odell Beckham Jr. They responded. Stafford did not commit a turnover after throwing interceptions that were returned for touchdowns in three other nationally televised games.\", \"For the Cardinals, Murray threw for 383 yards and two interceptions. He also rushed for 61 yards. \\u201cObviously, we lost and everybody wanted to win,\\u201d Murray said. \\u201cIt was a big night, a big game for us, but I\\u2019m not discouraged.\\u201d\", \"Beckham caught six passes for 77 yards and a touchdown, and Miller posted four tackles, including a critical one on fourth down. Beckham\\u2019s score was his third touchdown in his third game with the Rams since joining in free agency after his contentious exit from the Cleveland Browns. His production showcased that he is still an elite threat when used properly.\", \"\\u201cWe often forget \\u2014 there\\u2019s business, there\\u2019s politics, as always in this game \\u2014 but this is big kids at heart who love football,\\u201d Beckham said.\", \"The Rams entered Monday 2-4 against teams with a winning record, and had a three-game losing streak, against the Titans, the 49ers and the Packers, before drumming the Jaguars last week.\", \"All of their losses generally followed the same formula. Opponents were noticeably more physical \\u2014 in their losses, the Rams averaged 133 rushing yards allowed. Opposing quarterbacks dispersed the ball quickly \\u2014 Murray, Ryan Tannehill, Jimmy Garoppolo and Aaron Rodgers threw passes in just 2.5 seconds on average, according to N.F.L. NextGen Stats. Releasing the ball so rapidly negated the Rams\\u2019 potent pass rush.\", \"\\u201cOur goal is to try to build a team that stresses opposing teams and applies pressure to opposing teams,\\u201d Snead said in a news conference after acquiring Miller.\", \"Donald, a three-time N.F.L. defensive player of the year, succeeded early for the Rams on Monday night. He credited that to a defensive scheme and blitz packages that created one-on-one matchups allowing him and others to penetrate the backfield. In Ramsey\\u2019s absence, Darious Williams, normally the team\\u2019s No. 2 cornerback, also played well, with key pass breakups.\", \"\\u201cWe had a game plan, and we stuck to it,\\u201d Donald said.\", \"The score was tied, 13-13, at halftime before the Rams pulled away in the third quarter. Stafford lofted a perfect pass to Van Jefferson for a 52-yard touchdown and also connected with Cooper Kupp, who leads the league in every major receiving category, for a 4-yard score. Kupp caught 13 of his 15 targets for 123 yards.\", \"But Arizona responded. James Conner, who accounted for 125 yards from scrimmage, scored his second rushing touchdown at the start of the fourth quarter, slicing the Rams\\u2019 lead to 27-20. The Rams answered with a field goal that ended a drive that chewed over six minutes of clock. The Cardinals then kicked their own field goal before recovering the onside kick.\", \"Arizona now faces a winnable game against the Lions before playing the Colts, the Cowboys and the Seahawks \\u2014 competitive matchups that will impact whether they have home-field advantage for a playoff game.\", \"\\u201cThis group, we\\u2019re frustrated, we\\u2019re disappointed, but we\\u2019ll get back,\\u201d Coach Kliff Kingsbury said.\", \"The Rams are seeking to play at their home venue on Feb. 13, when SoFi Stadium hosts the Super Bowl. Snead\\u2019s strategy of forgoing draft picks in trades for Stafford, Ramsey and Miller has heightened their need to win now. But the Rams feel they are on the right path.\", \"\\u201cWe wanted to go out there and get the job done,\\u201d outside linebacker Leonard Floyd said. \\u201cWe got tired of the noise.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"dcc630d65dcd11ec87d345d49f11332b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dcc630d65dcd11ec87d345d49f11332b"}},
