As reported by the encyclopedia, there are only two other documented instances of an Ad\\u00e9lie penguin arriving on Aotearoa's shores - an adult corpse was discovered north of the Flaxbourne River mouth in Marlborough in December 1962, and a live bird was found in Kaikoura in January 1993.\", \"Singh, who was quick to share footage of the special encounter to social media, noticed the penguin was not returning to the water. Posting to Facebook, Singh said he and his wife remained at the beach for more than four hours to monitor the bird, which he said was \\\"continuously eating stones\\\".\\u00a0\", \"\\\"[We] did not want it to end up in a cat or dog's stomach,\\\" he said.\", \"After a few hours, Singh started to search for specialised rescuers on his phone and eventually made contact with Thomas Stracke, who operates a Christchurch-based rehabilitation service for sick and injured penguins in the Canterbury region. He has been caring for penguins for more than 10 years.\", \"Singh later confirmed on Facebook that Stracke had picked up the penguin and had taken some blood for testing. Footage posted to Singh's Facebook shows the penguin bundled in a blanket-lined container and being placed in the back of the car.\", \"Speaking to Stuff, Stracke said he \\\"never expected\\\" for the penguin to be an Ad\\u00e9lie when he received Singh's call on Wednesday evening.\", \"\\\"I was quite surprised,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\\\"It probably just lost its way.\\\"\", \"Stracke arranged a vet to accompany him and drove down to Birdlings Flat, arriving at the beach at about 10pm where Singh was still waiting.\", \"He told Stuff he believes the penguin is about one to two years old but is unsure of the gender. The\\u00a0blood test indicated the penguin is slightly underweight and dehydrated, he said, but otherwise appears in good health. The Department of Conservation has been notified.\\u00a0\", \"Stracke told the outlet the penguin will soon be released to a safe stretch of shoreline on Banks Peninsula - when the little penguin returns to the sea will be decided by the vet, he said.\\n\", \"A spokesperson for the Department of Conservation confirmed to Newshub the penguin is in the care of the experienced rescuer and they are currently getting an update on the next steps for the Ad\\u00e9lie.\"]","href_hash":"f63cb593433f11ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f63cb593433f11ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
