And for that reason, I'm strongly pro-life with the three exceptions I've mentioned. That's how I would vote.\\\"\", \"When asked again when he believes life begins, Oz said: \\\"If I'm pro-life, then that's a decision that comes back to the sanctity of when you think life does begin. And I believe that begins when you're in the mother's womb.\\\"\", \"Cain adds: \\\"When you're in your mother's womb?\\\" But that carries you all the way up to nine months of pregnancy.\\\"\", \"\\\"No, of course not, life's already started when you're in your mother's womb,\\\" Oz replied. \\\"But it's a rathole to get trapped in the different ways to talk about it.\", \"\\\"We need as a nation to make sure the Constitution is appropriately followed and people like me who are pro-life have our feelings respected, and this is something that should not be taken away from us by judiciary legislating from the bench.\\\"\", \"Cain concluded the interview by stating that future answers regarding abortion laws are \\\"going to have to be given specifically\\\" during Oz's campaign trail.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Conservative Views</div>\", \"Elsewhere during his appearance on Fox News, the TV host, who was appointed by Donald Trump to the presidential Council on Sports, Fitness and Health, discussed a popular right-wing talking point of so-called \\\"Big tech censorship,\\\" claiming that Facebook had recently restricted his campaign's account.\", \"\\\"If you don't go to war with Big Tech, they'll come after you over and over again,\\\" Oz added.\", \"Oz also assured potential voters that he does hold conservative views after Cain said that he wasn't even sure if the media personality, who has lived in New Jersey for the past two decades, would be running for the Senate as a Republican.\", \"\\\"Just because I have a show on a topic doesn't mean that I agree with what some of the guests are saying,\\\" Oz said.\", \"\\\"I'm pro-life. I'm pro-Second Amendment, lawful abiding individuals should be able to own a gun. There's many other examples where I'm conservative, and these are the values I was raised with.\", \"\\\"When I came over to Pennsylvania last year, I knew darn well exactly how I would campaign because I align very closely with Republican primary voters in this wonderful state.\\\"\", \"Oz has been contacted for further comment.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952842/dr-oz-abortion.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Dr. Oz visits \\\"Outnumbered Overtime with Harris Faulkner\\\" at Fox News Channel Studios on March 9, 2020, in New York City.
