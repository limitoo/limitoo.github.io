Both center on expanded interpretations of the American geopolitical \\\"domino theory,\\\" which once referred to the fears of communism spreading throughout Asia during the Cold War and today might apply to an expansion of the China's territorial boundaries as well as sphere of influence in the region and beyond.\", \"\\\"If China is able to capture Taiwan, there's no reason to believe that the Chinese Communist Party would stop there. China also has territorial claims against the Philippines, Japan, Vietnam and India,\\\" Cornyn said on the Senate floor on Tuesday while endorsing stronger deterrence in the Taiwan Strait.\", \"He added: \\\"We shouldn't view Taiwan as the CCP's ultimate goal but as the first domino in a quest to reach regional and global dominance. If Taiwan falls, it will not be the end, but rather a beginning.\\\"\", \"Of the many options available to China\\u2014a missile barrage, seizing outlying islands, a naval blockade or even a surprise decapitation attack against the Taiwanese leadership\\u2014a full-scale amphibious assault remains by far the riskiest. According to the Project 2049 Institute's Senior Director Ian Easton\\u2014author of 2017's The Chinese Invasion Threat: Taiwan's Defense and American Strategy in Asia\\u2014the unprecedented landing operation would require upwards of two million People's Liberation Army troops and accompany military vehicles and equipment.\", \"During a parliamentary session last month, Taiwan Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng told Taiwanese lawmakers that China was already capable of attacking Taiwan, but its \\\"cost and attrition\\\" would be lowest after 2025.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935993/what-happens-after-china-invades-taiwan.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">An F-16 fighter aircraft assigned to Taiwan's Republic of China Air Force overflies Taipei City during National Day celebrations on October 10, 2021, in Taipei, Taiwan.</div>\", \"Taiwan's important geostrategic position at the center of the first island chain is well documented, and there are now more public discussions among defense planners about what a Chinese-controlled Taiwan would mean for American security interests.\", \"The naval forces of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) assigned to the East and South China seas currently have few obvious routes into the Western Pacific, where Chinese nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines might threaten Guam, Hawaii and then eventually the continental U.S. The Bashi Channel (between Taiwan and the Philippines) and the Miyako Strait (between the Japanese islands of Miyako and Okinawa) are the most direct international waterways China's navy might use to thread the first island chain.\", \"It is around these critical chokepoints that analysts believe American-led military intervention or China's anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) tactics could turn the tide in a conflict between the PLA and Taiwan's armed forces, which are not likely to survive a lengthy war of attrition that turns from weeks into months.\", \"In spite of President Joe Biden's personal intentions and bipartisan support for Taiwan in Congress, the U.S. has not been legally bound to defend the island since the 1955 Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty expired in 1979, the year Washington switched formal diplomatic allegiances from Taipei to Beijing\\u2014and yet the U.S. remains Taiwan's staunchest international backer.\", \"Retired U.S. Marine Col. Grant Newsham, now a senior research fellow with Tokyo's Japan Forum for Strategic Studies, agrees with Cornyn's grim projection.\", \"\\\"The PRC might indeed try to grab some more territory\\u2014say from Japan, India, the Philippines, Indonesia or Malaysia,\\\" said Newsham, who was the first Marine Liaison Officer to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936221/china-soldiers-training-beijing.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers show their skills in Beijing, China. Experts warn that Taiwan could be the first domino in China's plans for global expansion.</div>\", \"But China doesn't have to seize more territory in order to exert control and influence over its neighbors. A successful Chinese takeover of Taiwan would in itself have far-reaching consequences for the postwar American \\\"hub-and-spokes\\\" alliance system in Asia, where the U.S. has as yet untested defense treaty commitments to Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia.\", \"Amid the rapid growth of PLA capabilities and the CCP's expansionist tendencies under Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the last decade, the U.S. has had to publicly guarantee the defense of Manila's forces in the South China Sea and reassure Tokyo it would intervene during an attack on the Japan-controlled Senkaku Islands.\", \"Newsham said there would be \\\"immense political fallout\\\" if the PRC seized Taiwan under America's watch. \\\"Most of Asia will 'turn red' almost overnight.
