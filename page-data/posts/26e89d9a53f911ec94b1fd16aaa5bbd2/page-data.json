Here are our picks for December.\", \"Adapted by \\u201cThe Piano\\u201d writer-director Jane Campion from Thomas Savage\\u2019s 1967 novel, \\u201cThe Power of the Dog\\u201d stars Benedict Cumberbatch as a 1920s Montana rancher named Phil Burbank \\u2014 a man with an aristocratic background and a thick sadistic streak. Jesse Plemons plays Phil\\u2019s much gentler brother George, who marries a local widow named Rose (Kirsten Dunst) and then disrupts the social dynamic on the Burbank spread when he invites Rose\\u2019s studious teenage son Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee) for a visit. Intriguing and unpredictable, \\u201cThe Power of the Dog\\u201d is a handsome-looking and difficult to define neo-western, exploring the sometimes suffocating expectations of traditional gender roles.\", \"Film buffs ought to find this creative series of video essays entertaining and challenging. Produced by thoughtful cinephiles (including the accomplished director David Fincher), \\u201cVoir\\u201d explores different aspects of movies and movie culture, including such subjects as: the sometimes limiting visual design of modern animation; the perverse appeal of antiheroes; and the thirst for broader cultural representation. The episodes combine new footage, old clips and probing interviews, skillfully edited into sharp commentaries on the transformative power of cinema.\", \"At once a parody of cruddy old \\u201980s and \\u201990s cartoons and a serialized story exploring the profound emptiness of some children\\u2019s entertainment, \\u201cSaturday Morning All Star Hits!\\u201d (a.k.a. \\u201cSMASH!\\u201d) stars the quirky comedian Kyle Mooney in a dual role as the shaggy twin brother hosts of an old network TV animation bloc. Mooney also cocreated the series with the adult animation veteran Ben Jones. Working with their team of writers and illustrators, Mooney and company riff on the vacuity of many fondly remembered kiddie shows.\", \"The hit TV adaptation of the Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski\\u2019s \\u201cThe Witcher\\u201d novels and short stories returns for a second season, continuing the story of the monster-hunter Geralt (Henry Cavill) and the various mercenaries and courtly agents who have crossed paths with him through his decades of service. This show\\u2019s narrative structure can get pretty intricate \\u2014 with intertwining story lines connecting different timelines \\u2014 but the main attractions remain the spectacular sword-and-sorcery action sequences and Cavill\\u2019s performance as a skilled warrior and magician burdened by his own talents.\", \"Written and directed by \\u201cThe Big Short\\u201d and \\u201cVice\\u201d filmmaker Adam McKay, the black comedy \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up\\u201d stars Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio as a pair of undistinguished scientists who discover that a comet is about to strike the Earth, obliterating life as we know it. The all-star cast includes Meryl Streep as a vain and shortsighted U.S. president, Mark Rylance as a quietly cocky tech guru, and Tyler Perry and Cate Blanchett as a pair of shallow, popular TV talk show hosts. These characters \\u2014 along with the skeptical general public \\u2014 block the heroes at every turn, in a movie that satirizes society\\u2019s unwillingness to acknowledge and tackle its toughest problems.\", \"Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley both shine in the writer-director Maggie Gyllenhaal\\u2019s adaptation of the Elena Ferrante novel \\u201cThe Lost Daughter.\\u201d The actresses play the same character at different ages: Leda Caruso, a brilliant scholar and mother who has sometimes felt resentful of her parental responsibilities. The movie mostly takes place at an island resort, where the vacationing older Leda keeps getting distracted by an overbearing family of tourists \\u2014 including a bewitching young mom named Nina (Dakota Johnson). As the story flashes back to Leda\\u2019s past, Gyllenhaal and company effectively dramatize the ambiguous feelings a lot of parents have toward the obligations that can get in the way of living freely.\", \"Also arriving: \\u201cLost in Space\\u201d Season 3 (Dec. 1), \\u201cSingle All the Way\\u201d (Dec. 2), \\u201cThe Great British Baking Show: Holidays\\u201d Season 3 (Dec. 3), \\u201cMixtape\\u201d (Dec. 3), \\u201cMoney Heist\\u201d Season 5, Volume 2 (Dec. 3), \\u201cShaun the Sheep: The Flight Before Christmas\\u201d (Dec. 3), \\u201cAsakusa Kid\\u201d (Dec. 9), \\u201cBack to the Outback\\u201d (Dec. 10), \\u201cHow to Ruin Christmas\\u201d Season 2 (Dec. 10), \\u201cThe Unforgivable\\u201d (Dec. 10), \\u201cThe Future Diary\\u201d (Dec. 14), \\u201cEmily in Paris\\u201d Season 2 (Dec. 22), \\u201cKitz\\u201d (Dec. 30), \\u201cCobra Kai\\u201d Season 4 (Dec. 31), \\u201cStay Close\\u201d (Dec. 31).\", \"A screwball comedy twist on the traditional holiday romance, \\u201cChristmas on the Farm\\u201d stars Poppy Montgomery as Emmy, a struggling New York writer who lands a huge book deal by passing off her late mother\\u2019s journals about life in rural Queensland as her own autobiography. When her publisher asks to spend an old-fashioned Australian Christmas with her new star author, Emmy has to scramble to pretend she\\u2019s a traditionalist farmer\\u2019s wife \\u2014 a ruse complicated by the arrival of the publisher\\u2019s attractive son.\", \"This semi-true crime story stars Olivia Colman and David Thewlis as the married couple Susan and Christopher Edwards, who lived a long time with a dark secret: that Susan killed her parents, and that she and Christopher lived off the pension checks of the corpses buried in the backyard. In \\u201cLandscapers,\\u201d the writer Ed Sinclair and the director Will Sharpe use their antiheroes\\u2019 love of movies to inject a little stylistic flair into what is ultimately a strange kind of mystery, delving into the reasons two lovers felt obliged to turn to violence and chicanery.\", \"The comedian Will Forte and his former \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d collaborators Jorma Taccone and John Solomon revive Forte\\u2019s cult favorite character MacGruber, a bumbling special agent modeled after the hero of the TV series \\u201cMacGyver\\u201d (but much, much sillier). MacGruber debuted in a string of \\u201cSNL\\u201d sketches that kept finding inventive new ways to rework the same punchline: showing how a momentary distraction could lead to utter disaster. Like the 2010 movie version, expect this new serialized \\u201cMacGruber\\u201d to mock \\u2014 with love \\u2014 over-the-top spy thrillers.\", \"Though it is classified as science-fiction, this mini-series adaptation of Emily St. John Mandel\\u2019s 2014 novel may strike some as a ripped-from-the-headlines drama. Set in the years before, during and after a devastating pandemic, \\u201cStation Eleven\\u201d primarily follows Kirsten (Mackenzie Davis), a member of a traveling theater troupe trying to keep culture alive in the makeshift settlements the plague\\u2019s survivors established. While tracking Kirsten\\u2019s journey through this sometimes-terrifying new world, the show flashes back to the way things used to be, telling ironic stories about troubled characters who had no idea how bad things were about to get.\", \"The late hip-hop artist Christopher \\u201cBiggie Smalls\\u201d Wallace \\u2014 A.K.A. \\u201cthe Notorious B.I.G.\\u201d \\u2014 was a pioneering rapper whose songs about growing up in a crime-ridden neighborhood influenced a generation of musicians. As this documentary makes clear though, there was more to Wallace than just his pulpy crime stories. With the help from interviews with Wallace\\u2019s mother, wife, friends and colleagues, the director Mark Ford paints a picture of a man of many interests, who was killed before he had the chance to fully prove that his work could fuse different genres and ideas into a new sound.\", \"Also arriving: \\u201cPositive\\u201d Season 1 (Dec. 2), \\u201cZoey\\u2019s Extraordinary Christmas\\u201d (Dec. 2), \\u201cBerlin Station\\u201d Seasons 1-3 (Dec. 3), \\u201cPen15\\u201d Season 2, Part 2 (Dec. 4), \\u201cThe Defence\\u201d Season 2 (Dec. 10), \\u201cHigh\\u201d Season 1 (Dec. 10), \\u201cBillionaire Scoundrel\\u201d Season 1 (Dec. 14), \\u201cAmsterdam Undercover\\u201d Season 1 (Dec. 17), \\u201cClaws\\u201d Season 4 (Dec. 20), \\u201cDragons: The Nine Realms\\u201d Season 1 (Dec. 24), \\u201cBump\\u201d Season 2 (Dec. 26), \\u201cPerfect Places\\u201d Season 3 (Dec. 28).\", \"The phenomenal Riz Ahmed stars in this tricky science-fiction thriller, playing a Marine who becomes convinced that the Earth has been invaded by evil alien insects that only he seems able to detect. The director Michael Pearce (who also co-wrote the script with Joe Barton) keeps the action in \\u201cEncounter\\u201d low to the ground. He also keeps the matter of the hero\\u2019s fragile mental state mostly ambiguous, making this movie into the story of a loving father determined to save his young sons from a threat that may not exist.\", \"Though it has never been a huge hit, the science-fiction series \\u201cThe Expanse\\u201d \\u2014 based on James S.A. Corey\\u2019s novels \\u2014 is such a favorite among genre connoisseurs that it was saved from cancellation back in 2018, just after Season 3. The upcoming Season 6 is being touted as the show\\u2019s finale; but there are still lots of stories to be told within this future universe, where human colonists scattered throughout the solar system (and beyond) are perpetually on the brink of war. Still, until \\u201cThe Expanse\\u201d gets rescued again, fans should savor what could be the last days of one of TV\\u2019s most exciting and well-plotted space sagas.\", \"Nicole Kidman plays the groundbreaking comedian Lucille Ball, and Javier Bardem plays her husband and business partner Desi Arnaz in the backstage drama \\u201cBeing the Ricardos,\\u201d set mostly during one week in the production of the 1950s sitcom \\u201cI Love Lucy.\\u201d The writer-director Aaron Sorkin \\u2014 who has tread this kind of ground before with his TV series \\u201cSports Night\\u201d and \\u201cStudio 60 on the Sunset Strip\\u201d \\u2014 uses a fragment of Ball\\u2019s life story as a way into a larger consideration of old-fashioned American showbiz, locked into an era marked by Communist witch-hunts and a staunchly paternalistic social order.\", \"Also arriving: \\u201cHarlem\\u201d (Dec. 3), \\u201cThe Ferragnez\\u201d (Dec. 9), \\u201cWith Love\\u201d (Dec. 17), \\u201cYearly Departed\\u201d (Dec. 23).\"]","href_hash":"26e89d9a53f911ec94b1fd16aaa5bbd2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"26e89d9a53f911ec94b1fd16aaa5bbd2"}},
