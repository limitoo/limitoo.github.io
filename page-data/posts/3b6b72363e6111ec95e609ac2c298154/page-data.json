Spectators can track runners by entering a runner\\u2019s bib numbers or first and last name into the \\u201cTracking\\u201d field on the app\\u2019s menu. Runners can also download the app and use a \\u201cshare tracking\\u201d function in their profiles to send a link to friends and family.\", \"Once you start tracking a runner, you\\u2019ll receive automatic push notifications throughout the race, including when the runner crosses the start line, hits the halfway point and crosses the finish line. You can watch runners in real time on the course using the \\u201cMap\\u201d field in the app\\u2019s menu.\", \"The app will also provide a spectator guide with tips for travel directions and the best viewing locations along the route, as well as a runner\\u2019s estimated finish time. \", \"Runner tracking is also available online at liveresults.nyrr.org.\", \"Viewers can catch the race live from home on ESPN2 nationally (8:30 to 11:30 a.m. Eastern time) and WABC-TV, Channel 7 locally (8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Eastern).\"]","href_hash":"3b6b72363e6111ec95e609ac2c298154"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3b6b72363e6111ec95e609ac2c298154"}},
