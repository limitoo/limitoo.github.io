An aide is seen approaching the president, who then opens his eyes and claps as the speech ends.\", \"The video soon went viral, and has been viewed more than 4.6 million times as of early Tuesday. Some criticized the president for the optics of the moment, but others expressed sympathy for the president's jet-lagged state.
