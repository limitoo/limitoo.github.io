It was a pleasure working with him, and we can already see from this short working relationship that he has great potential and will have a very bright future in motorsport.\\\"\", \"Lawson admits to nerves before his big drive, but says he felt at home after a few laps in a car that could be a glimpse into his future.\", \"French No.1 Gasly is off contract at the end of the 2022 season and is reportedly courted by several teams, including Alpine and Aston Martin, while he could also return to Red Bull in 2023 to partner Verstappen.\", \"Lawson, who's time of 1.24.517s was nearly three seconds down on Verstappen's fastest lap during Monday's Grand Prix, would be the logical fit to partner with Tsunoda, who is one of his best friends.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The biggest difference is just the downforce,\\\" he says. \\\"There's significantly more than anything I'm used to. \", \"\\\"We worked on a lot of different things in the run plan today, both short and long runs with different tyres, and one thing that was really cool and new to me was the live data.\", \"\\\"The ability to have the team update me as I'm out on track was something new to me. Getting feedback from Yuki too was also really great.\", \"\\\"We've been teammates before, so it was good to get his understanding and learnings, and it was nice to be back driving with him again.\", \"\\\"I really didn't want to get out of the car today - it's been amazing to get my first taste of F1.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"81f0f05a5e5211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"81f0f05a5e5211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
