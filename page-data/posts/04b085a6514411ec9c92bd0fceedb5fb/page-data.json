Nissan Motor is aiming for a 50% \\\"electrification\\\" of the company's model lineup, under what Uchida called the \\\"Nissan Ambition 2030\\\" long-term plan. Electrified vehicles include hybrids and other kinds of environmentally friendly models other than just electric vehicles.\", \"\\\"Nissan will continue to evolve its lithium-ion battery technologies and introduce cobalt-free technology to bring the cost of battery packs ... by 2028,\\\" the company stated in a press release. With automakers pledging to soon make most of their vehicles electric,\\u00a0lithium demand\\u00a0is expected to increase as much as tenfold in the next decade.\", \"Nissan's effort is focused mainly on electric vehicles to cut emissions and meet various customers' needs, said Uchida. Nissan also will reduce carbon emissions at its factories, he added.\", \"The company has been struggling to put the scandal of its former Chairman Carlos Ghosn behind it. Ghosn, who led Nissan for two decades, after he was sent to Japan by French alliance partner Renault, was arrested in Tokyo in 2018 on various financial misconduct charges.\", \"Uchida made no mention of the scandal but referred to \\\"past mistakes\\\" he promised won't be repeated at Nissan.\", \"Nissan's \\\"electrification\\\" rests on developing a new ASSB, or all solid state battery, that it categorized as \\\"a breakthrough\\\" for being cheaper and generating more power than batteries now in use.\", \"That means electric powertrains can be more easily used in trucks, vans and other heavier vehicles because the batteries can be smaller. The ASSB will be in mass production by 2028, according to Nissan.\", \"The costs of electric vehicles will also fall thanks to the battery innovation to levels comparable with regular gasoline cars, Uchida said.\", \"\\\"Nissan has emerged from a crisis and is ready to make a new start,\\\" he said.\", \"All top automakers, including Nissan's Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp., are working on electric vehicles, amid growing concern over climate change and sustainability.
