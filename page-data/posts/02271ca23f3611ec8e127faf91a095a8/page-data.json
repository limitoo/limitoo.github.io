They can be broken down roughly into three camps: Republicans who consulted with negotiators on the bill; Republicans who maintain the party\\u2019s traditional view that funding infrastructure is more important than fighting a president of a different party; and members of the liberal group known as the Squad.\", \"Six Democrats who are part of the progressive group known as \\u201cThe Squad\\u201d \\u2014 Jamaal Bowman of New York; Cori Bush of Missouri; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \\u2014 voted against Mr. Biden\\u2019s plan to spend $550 billion in new funds over 10 years to shore up roads, bridges and highways, improve internet access and modernize the nation\\u2019s power grid.\", \"The Squad has grown from four to six members since 2019, when Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the highest-profile progressive on Capitol Hill, entered Congress. Its members were among the leading supporters of the strategy to use the infrastructure bill as leverage for passing Mr. Biden\\u2019s broader agenda: a $1.85 trillion social safety net and climate change bill.\", \"Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has argued that the provisions in Mr. Biden\\u2019s bill to fight climate change are needed to offset the impact on the environment from a surge in funding for construction projects.\", \"Passing the infrastructure bill without the larger domestic policy package \\u201cmakes our emissions & climate crisis worse,\\u201d she wrote on Twitter in October. \\u201cIt keeps us in the emissions red.\\u201d\", \"Her position was shared by the nearly 100-member Congressional Progressive Caucus until centrist Democrats pledged Friday night that they would vote for the domestic policy bill no later than the week of Nov. 15, unless the Congressional Budget Office determines its costs are \\u201cinconsistent\\u201d with the $1.85 trillion estimate put forth by Mr. Biden\\u2019s staff.\", \"While most progressives then agreed to vote for the bill, members of the Squad did not view the centrists\\u2019 assurances as good enough and chose to stick with their position of demanding both bills pass at the same time. Ms. Bush said that passing the infrastructure bill alone \\u201cjeopardized our leverage\\u201d on the broader bill \\u2014 which includes monthly payments to families with children, universal prekindergarten, health care subsidies and a four-week paid family and medical leave program \\u2014 and endangered progressives\\u2019 ability to \\u201cimprove the livelihood of our health care workers, our children, our caregivers, our seniors, and the future of our environment.\\u201d\", \"Still, Ms. Pressley waited to make sure the infrastructure bill had enough votes to pass before she voted against the measure.\", \"That position infuriated some moderate Democrats. One of them, Representative Tom Suozzi of New York, equated the opposition of left-leaning fellow New Yorkers like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Bowman with far-right Republicans like Lee Zeldin of New York for voting against a bill that would funnel billions of dollars into the state for subways, sewers and broadband.\", \"\\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t make any sense,\\u201d Mr. Suozzi, who is contemplating a run for governor, told reporters at a New York political conclave in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Saturday. \\u201cThese are two sides of the same coin: People so far out on the fringe instead of trying to get stuff done to help people and make peoples livers better. That\\u2019s what people are sick and tired of.\\u201d\", \"Eight Republicans who voted in favor of the infrastructure bill \\u2014 Don Bacon of Nebraska, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Andrew Garbarino of New York, Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, John Katko of New York, Tom Reed of New York, Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey and Fred Upton of Michigan \\u2014 were part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who helped negotiate the infrastructure bill this summer, consulting with centrists in the Senate.\", \"The group known as the Problems Solvers Caucus, including Mr. Fitzpatrick, the Republican co-chairman, had once hoped to deliver as many as 29 Republican House votes for the bill, but saw members fall away once Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, and other top Republicans opposed it as they ramped up their campaign against Mr. Biden\\u2019s agenda.\", \"Still, with improvements to highways, bridges, dams, public transit, rail, ports, airports, water quality and broadband coming to the districts, eight members of the group cast their votes in favor of the plan.\", \"Mr. Garbarino, who represents part of Long Island, cited the benefits for New York \\u2014 including $24.9 billion for highways, bridges and transit; $15 billion to replace lead service lines for drinking water; and $470 million for New York\\u2019s Kennedy, La Guardia, MacArthur and Republic airports \\u2014 among his reasons for embracing the bill.\", \"The vote \\u201cwas about roads, bridges, and clean water,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was about real people, and the tangible action Congress could take to better their lives by rebuilding and revitalizing our nation\\u2019s crumbling infrastructure.\\u201d\", \"A final group of five House Republicans joined members of the Problem Solvers Caucus in bucking their party to support the bill. This group \\u2014 Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, Don Young of Alaska, Nicole Malliotakis of New York, David B. McKinley of West Virginia and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey \\u2014 can be roughly defined as embracing the party\\u2019s traditionalist view of funding infrastructure.\", \"Mr. Young, 88, is the Republican Party\\u2019s longest-serving member, having represented Alaska for 25 terms. He endorsed the bill in September, arguing the party has always supported funding roads and bridges and emphasizing that past infrastructure votes were \\u201cdarn near\\u201d unanimous.\", \"\\u201cWe need infrastructure in this country now,\\u201d Mr. Young said. \\u201cThis is the last opportunity we have to make sure those potholes are filed, those airports run right, that bridges are safe and our economy can continue to grow.\\u201d\", \"Others, much newer to Congress, said they shared Mr. Young\\u2019s view on the issue.\", \"Ms. Malliotakis, who is in her first term representing Staten Island, released a statement explaining her vote that listed various projects the funding could support in her community, including \\u201ccompleting the High-Occupancy Vehicles lane on the Staten Island Expressway,\\u201d fortifying coastal neighborhoods and expanding \\u201cour sewer systems to deal with the next Superstorm Sandy or Hurricane Ida.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSimply put, it\\u2019s this type of investment that will not only save city residents\\u2019 time and money, but also their properties and lives,\\u201d she said.\"]","href_hash":"02271ca23f3611ec8e127faf91a095a8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"02271ca23f3611ec8e127faf91a095a8"}},
