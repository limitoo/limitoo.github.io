We are better than this as a party and I absolutely expect better than this of our candidates.\\\" Weiser had congratulated Regan last week.\", \"Similar condemnations were made by the Kent County GOP chairman, House Speaker Jason Wentworth and Sen. Mark Huizenga, whose elevation to the chamber last fall opened up the Republican-heavy seat that Regan is favored to fill in a May election. Democrats and the conservative Michigan Freedom Fund had begun rebuking Regan a day before.\", \"\\\"As a Christian, a public servant and a father of two daughters, I find Robert Regan's comments about sexual assault to be revolting and immoral, and I strongly denounce them,\\\" Huizenga said in a statement. \\\"His statements about Russia's unprovoked attack of a sovereign country are contrary to our own nation's values, and his antisemitic posts claiming Jewish people control the banks and were behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks are shameful and disgusting.\\\"\", \"Democratic Rep.
