However, I guess the bulk of tahr control has been done from helicopters,\\\" he said.\", \"DOC traditionally uses a helicopter (or aerial control) method to cull tahr due to the rugged terrain of the alps and the ability to spot the animals in the snow.\", \"Brookman said tahr usually occupy the alpine tussock environment above the bush line, but this is changing.\", \"\\\"Lately, there's been a growing body of observation which suggests that tahr, particularly on the West Coast ... have been increasingly occupying areas of sub-alpine scrub and forest. And the additional cover they get from those habitats may mean that helicopter control is less effective.\\\"\", \"He described the method as \\\"old school\\\" and said the hunters would be DOC staff or professional pest controllers.\", \"\\\"In the trial, we'll be looking to see whether it can increase our effectiveness in those particular environments [Westland bush] either as a stand alone tool or in conjunction with helicopter-based work.\\\"\", \"Brookman assured recreational hunters helicopter methods had finished for the year and would not be ruining any summer hunting trips.\", \"Tahr control plans are developed annually with the Tahr Plan Implementation Liaison Group (TPILG).\", \"\\\"TPILG is a group of stakeholders that provide reference to DOC from across the hunting sector, conservation groups, other interested groups and critically, our Te Tiriti partners from Te R\\u016bnanga o Ng\\u0101i Tahu,\\\" Brookman said.\", \"Results from the trial are expected ahead of the next annual plan release in July 2022.\"]","href_hash":"a174125c65af11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a174125c65af11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
