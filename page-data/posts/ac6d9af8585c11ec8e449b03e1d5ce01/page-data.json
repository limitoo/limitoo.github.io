comet chaser\\u00a0is monitoring the progress of Comet Leonard as it streaks towards the Sun.\", \"The small comet is not yet visible in the southern hemisphere, but if\\u00a0it survives the next seven days, it could put on a nice show in Australian skies for Christmas.\", \"But as the saying goes, comets are like cats:\\u00a0they both have tails and they do precisely what they want.\", \"\\\"[Comets] are difficult to predict and that's what makes them\\u00a0so interesting,\\\" said Mr Mattiazzo, an amateur astronomer from Victoria who runs the Southern Comet Homepage.\", \"And right now, C/2021 AI Comet Leonard\\u00a0is threatening to break apart.\", \"\\\"It's hanging by a thread,\\\" said Mr Mattiazzo, who has been observing comets since 1986 and has discovered several\\u00a0of these astronomical objects.\", \"\\\"Given my observing experience, I know that this comet is slightly in trouble because it's at the borderline of whether it will survive its approach to the Sun or not.\", \"\\\"It's a day-to-day wait.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Where did Comet Leonard come from?</div>\", \"Comet Leonard was discovered on January 3\\u00a0this year by US astronomer Greg Leonard.\", \"At about just 1 kilometre across, the dirty snowball \\u2013\\u00a0or snowy dirtball \\u2013\\u00a0hails from way out in the\\u00a0icy reaches of our Solar System, astronomer Jonti Horner said.\", \"\\\"It's a lump of ice and rubble that is left over from the formation of the Solar System 4.5 billion years ago.'\", \"The comet moves on a highly elliptical orbit that takes it out\\u00a0about\\u00a03,700 times further from the Sun than we are.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/2f85742e9a1147670dcb451a6ae6c84e\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\",

taken tens of thousands of years to reach us.\", \"\\\"The last time it came through the inner Solar System was probably 80,000 years ago,\\\" Professor Horner said.\", \"The comet is predicted to swing around the Sun on January 3, 2022 \\u2013\\u00a0if it makes it that far.\", \"\\\"One good thing is the Earth approach happens before the Sun approach,\\\" Mr Mattiazzo said.\", \"As a comet gets closer to the Sun, it heats up and can break apart.\", \"\\\"If it ends up [breaking apart] after its Sun\\u00a0approach, that's fine.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">When can we see it?</div>\", \"If the comet hangs together, we'll see it in the skies above Australia from December 17 onwards.\", \"<img

hemisphere.\", \"Images Mr Mattiazzo has remotely taken using a US telescope show the comet has a\\u00a0halo of blue gas and a straight dust tail.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"When you see a flattened head on a comet, you know it's a small object, so it's going to battle to win the\\u00a0solar encounter,\\\" Mr Mattiazzo said.\", \"It\\u00a0will sweep past Earth on December 12.\", \"As it comes closer \\u2013\\u00a0flying past about 35 million kilometres\\u00a0away \\u2013\\u00a0it will get brighter but drop from view in the northern hemisphere.\", \"\\\"The northerners will lose out, they will only see it\\u00a0up to about December 11,\\\"\\u00a0Mr Mattiazzo said.\", \"Then the southern hemisphere will get the prime view.\", \"\\\"The fun will start when it is visible from December 17, that's when I'll be out every night trying to capture it with a telescope and a camera,\\\" Mr Mattiazzo said.\", \"On December 18, the comet has a close encounter with Venus, coming to within just 4 million kilometres of our closest planetary neighbour.\", \"That will make it the closest approach of a comet to Venus in recorded history, Professor Horner said.\", \"\\\"That means from the point of view of Venus, it would be really, really spectacular,\\\" he said.\", \"It also means we will be able to use Venus as a guide to find it in the sky.\", \"<img
