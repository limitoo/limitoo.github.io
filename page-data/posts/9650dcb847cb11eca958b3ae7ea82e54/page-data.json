For some conservative Catholics, the real question was more pointed: Should Catholic politicians who publicly support and advance abortion rights be denied the sacrament?\", \"Though the document shied away from explicitly challenging Mr. Biden, its very existence highlighted a divide between conservative American bishops and the Vatican, and pitted some of the nation\\u2019s most powerful prelates against the country\\u2019s Catholic president.\", \"It also illuminated sprawling rifts among ordinary American Catholics, falling along lines that have become familiar since the presidency of Donald J. Trump scrambled both political and religious loyalties. An emboldened Catholic right wing, including media outlets and activist groups, now feels increasingly free to antagonize Pope Francis and his agenda. \", \"The document, approved overwhelmingly, was the result of a contentious meeting in June, when the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops voted to draft the guidance after hours of debate. That vote was a victory for conservative bishops who have depicted Mr. Biden in particular as a grave threat to the church. On Inauguration Day in January, Archbishop Jose\\u0301 H. Gomez of Los Angeles, the conference\\u2019s president, issued a statement characterizing the new president as advancing policies that \\u201cadvance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage and gender.\\u201d\", \"This time, bishops took their debates over the issue behind closed doors in an executive session the evening before the vote.\", \"Though the new guidance does not single out individuals, it does emphasize the obligation of Catholic public figures to demonstrate moral consistency between their personal faith and their public actions. \\u201cLay people who exercise some form of public authority\\u201d have a special responsibility to \\u201cserve the human family by upholding human life and dignity,\\u201d the document states. And it says that bishops have a \\u201cspecial responsibility\\u201d to address situations in which there is a gap between public actions and church teaching. \", \"Pope Francis has not officially weighed in, but he maintains a warm relationship with Mr. Biden, who is the country\\u2019s second Catholic president and attends Mass regularly. In October, the pope welcomed the president to the Vatican for a private meeting. Mr. Biden told reporters afterward that the pope had called him a \\u201cgood Catholic\\u201d and that he should continue receiving communion. Mr. Biden received communion at St. Patrick\\u2019s Church in Rome the next day.\", \"Asked about the communion issue by reporters in September, the pope remarked that \\u201cI have never refused the eucharist to anyone,\\u201d though he noted that he had not knowingly been presented with the dilemma.\", \"Archbishop Christophe Pierre, the Vatican\\u2019s representative to the United States, referenced the discord in an address to the group on Tuesday. \\u201cThere is the temptation to treat the eucharist as something to be offered to the privileged few,\\u201d he said, echoing the pope\\u2019s maxim that the sacrament is not a \\u201cprize for the perfect.\\u201d\", \"The document approved on Wednesday does not address the question of public figures\\u2019 right to the eucharist head-on as some had hoped \\u2014 and others feared. And the 29-page guidance barely mentions the word \\u201cabortion.\\u201d \", \"Instead, it offers a detailed examination of the theological and spiritual significance of the eucharist, in which Catholics believe that bread and wine literally become the body and blood of Christ\", \". The text quotes the 20th-century activist Dorothy Day, St. Augustine and Pope Francis\\u2019 Twitter feed.\", \"Catholic leaders have expressed concerns for years that lay Catholics do not understand the church\\u2019s core teachings on the eucharist. Those anxieties sharpened when a Pew poll in 2019 found that more than two-thirds of American Catholics believe that the bread and wine of communion are mere symbols.\", \"But the ecclesiastical debate has also served as a proxy for battles over politics, power and the future of the Catholic Church.\", \"The meeting in Baltimore was the first in-person general assembly of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops since 2019. Last year\\u2019s meeting was canceled as a precaution during the coronavirus pandemic. In June, the bishops convened virtually.\", \"The weeks leading up to the meeting were roiled by conflict. In early November, Archbishop Gomez delivered a speech in which he dismissed social justice movements and \\u201cwokeness\\u201d as dangerous false religions. The speech, delivered virtually to the Congress of Catholics and Public Life, drew a sharp backlash from some scholars and progressives.\", \"In an opening address at the meeting on Tuesday, Archbishop Gomez struck a less inflammatory tone, asking how the church can engage an increasingly secular country. He lamented a breakdown of a shared national \\u201cstory\\u201d that was \\u201crooted in a biblical worldview and the values of our Judeo-Christian heritage.\\u201d The speech received a standing ovation from the bishops in Baltimore.\", \"The new document emphasizes the distinction between categories of sins and reminds Catholics that they should not receive communion in a state of mortal sin \\u2014 a grave offense committed willingly \\u2014 without first going to confession and receiving absolution. \", \"The text quotes from a 2007 text known as the Aparecida Document, named for a gathering of bishops in Central and South America and issued by a committee headed by Pope Francis himself, who was then Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio. That document has come to be read as a foundational text of his approach. And it contains sharp words for \\u201clegislators, heads of government and health professionals\\u201d who violate church teaching on abortion and other \\u201cgrave crimes against life and family.\\u201d Catholics in such positions of influence may not receive communion, it says.\", \"In May, the Vatican warned the U.S. bishops in a letter that they should engage in \\u201cextensive and serene dialogue\\u201d before drafting the document, cautioning that the vote could \\u201cbecome a source of discord rather than unity.\\u201d\", \"Conservatives described the result as a document that points to the importance of maintaining standards around the eucharist. Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas, who has been sharply critical of Mr. Biden, said in an interview that although the document did not name names, it \\u201cdoes acknowledge that not everyone should just walk up and receive.\\u201d\", \"The conference attracted onlookers and protesters with a wide variety of theological and political objections to the proceedings, and the direction of the church more broadly.\", \"On Monday, a coalition of liberal groups participated in a prayer walk outside the hotel that called on the bishops to \\u201cbe pastors, not political operatives.\\u201d\", \"On Tuesday, at a waterfront pavilion within view of the hotel where the conference was taking place, hundreds of conservative Catholics attended a combative prayer rally hosted by the right-wing Catholic media outlet Church Militant. The rally, titled \\u201cEnough Is Enough,\\u201d was intended to express a range of objections to the church hierarchy. Signs in the crowd included \\u201cNo Communion for Killers\\u201d and \\u201cLet\\u2019s Go Brandon,\\u201d a coded phrase that signifies a condemnation of Mr. Biden.\", \"One expected speaker at the Church Militant event, Stephen K. Bannon, did not appear after being indicted by a grand jury last week on two counts of contempt of Congress after he refused to provide information to a House investigation of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Mr. Bannon appeared in federal court on Monday.\", \"Mr. Bannon, an architect of Mr. Trump\\u2019s rise as a populist hero, has positioned himself in recent years as a \\u201cgladiator\\u201d of right-wing Catholicism. The Church Militant event was emceed by Milo Yiannopoulos, a media persona who has been largely drummed out of mainstream conservative venues over his comments minimizing the seriousness of pedophilia, among other issues.\", \"Gladys Garavito had traveled from Jacksonville, Fla., to attend the event with her sister. A lifelong Catholic, she described feeling disillusioned in recent years by the hierarchy\\u2019s failure to stand up to liberal politicians like Mr. Biden. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like there\\u2019s two Catholic worlds,\\u201d Ms. Garavito said, describing a growing divide between \\u201ccountry club Catholics\\u201d like the president and Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, and \\u201ctraditional\\u201d believers like herself.\", \"\\u201cThis is the church,\\u201d she said, gesturing to the defiant crowd around her. \\u201cThis is what the church should be, and this is what the church is meant to be.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9650dcb847cb11eca958b3ae7ea82e54"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9650dcb847cb11eca958b3ae7ea82e54"}},
