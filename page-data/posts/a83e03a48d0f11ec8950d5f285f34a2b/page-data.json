Fire and Emergency notes that the fire report has not considered this kind of risk assessment.\\\"\", \"As for the Mercy design, \\\"given the vulnerability of the patients and the extra time that may be required to evacuate the patients, occupants in the ICU may not be able to escape as the conditions outside of the room may be difficult for way-finding\\\".\", \"Operating theatres might need up to an hour to stabilise a patient to evacuate - but at Manuka St Hospital's redevelopment in Nelson it was not clear if the design allowed for this, another memo said.\", \"It is up to councils what to do with FENZ's advice. Engineers often amend a design.\", \"Sometimes they get in early, engaging in a Fire Engineering Brief or FEB, although several memos noted how designs proceeded as if all the problems raised in a FEB had been addressed, when they hadn't.\", \"In most of the 45 designs, FENZ says there was information that was wrong or missing. It frequently listed half a dozen basic details omitted, such as what materials are made of or how penetrations through walls will be sealed.\", \"Its criticism runs to a dozen pages - twice the size of most of the other memos - of design at Middlemore Hospital in South Auckland for new renal and catheter lab facilities.\", \"The design seemed to draw on \\\"pure speculation\\\" or \\\"a best guess\\\" around how many patients might need evacuating, and by how many staff, and did not consider a worst-case scenario or a \\\"fast\\\" fire, FENZ said.\", \"It assumed people would walk through smoke to get out, when advice indicated they might not.\", \"\\\"The suggested evacuation times ... appear entirely unsubstantiated and may not be adequate.\\\"\", \"The design was not robust enough, it said, going so far as to advise Auckland Council to \\\"refuse this consent\\\".\", \"The project was delayed but has gone ahead.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/280130/eight_col_pics_of_hosp_%281%29.jpg?1636760026\\\" alt=\\\"Whang\\u0101rei Hospital\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nWhang\\u0101rei Hospital. \\nPhoto: RNZ / Sam Olley\\n</div>\", \"The memos show months of toing and froing over designs in several cases.\", \"In an unusual case, FENZ's engineers told Whang\\u0101rei Hospital the building it was upgrading for children's and special care baby services, had exterior cladding on it that could spread a fire.\", \"The aluminium composite panel was of a fire-resistant type that's come under scrutiny since the fatal Grenfell Tower fire in London. The insulation in the wall at Whangarei also was non-compliant.\", \"DHBs have been asking since last year for formal instructions to guide fire engineers on healthcare facility designs. RNZ has asked authorities where this has got up to.\", \"More formalised rules covering fire designs on most commercial buildings were scrapped for hospitals in 2017 because they weren't working.\"]","href_hash":"a83e03a48d0f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a83e03a48d0f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
