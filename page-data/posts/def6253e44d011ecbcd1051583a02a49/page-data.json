So they can keep arguing about height definitions but they're going to keep dragging up coral if they trawl these areas.\\\"\", \"In order to protect Aotearoa's ocean life and prevent biodiversity collapse, trawling needed to be restricted, Hooper said.\", \"\\\"When it comes to the ocean, it is not all created equal. So when we choose what to protect, that should be based on the most biodiverse, important areas for marine life, and seamounts fit this bill.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"def6253e44d011ecbcd1051583a02a49"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"def6253e44d011ecbcd1051583a02a49"}},
