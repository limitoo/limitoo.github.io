biggest oil and gas development to be built in Australia in a decade, after sanctioning its $16.5 billion Scarborough project off Western Australia.\", \"In a move that has enraged green groups, Woodside announced it had approved the Scarborough development and the associated upgrade of its\\u00a0Pluto liquefied natural gas facility near Karratha, 1,600km north of Perth.\", \"The decision comes despite a furious, last-ditch bid by environmentalists to stymie the project after the Conservation Council of WA last week launched legal action, claiming the project\\u00a0required assessment under federal law.\", \"That decision also coincided with news that the boards of Woodside and BHP had agreed to merge their petroleum businesses in a $40 billion deal, which\\u00a0will create one of

be the biggest oil and gas development undertaken in Australia since the end of a $US200 billion ($275\\u00a0billion)\\u00a0investment splurge 10 years ago.\", \"The project will involve the construction of a 430-kilometre\\u00a0pipeline, linking the Scarborough gas field to the mainland, as well as a second production train at the Pluto LNG processing plant.\", \"At the peak of construction, as many as 3,200 jobs are expected to be created, with first production slated for 2026.\", \"Woodside's chief executive, Meg O'Neill, alluded to the project's importance to the company's future by noting it would provide cashflow and fund future developments for decades.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/8efeacefbcd9e4b05ab329f474a11b32\\\"

China and Japan.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The Scarborough reservoir contains only around 0.1 per cent carbon dioxide, and Scarborough gas, processed through the efficient and expanded Pluto LNG facility,

\"Graeme Bethune, the chief executive of analyst firm EnergyQuest, said the Scarborough project would buttress Woodside's financial position and made strong commercial sense given forecasts of high gas prices for years.\", \"Mr Bethune said the end of gas had been overstated and pointed to the scores of LNG projects on the table in the US, with\\u00a0energy superpower Qatar as evidence of this.\", \"However, he acknowledged the difficulty in Australian companies developing mega oil and gas projects and suggested Scarborough may be the last of its kind in the country.\", \"\\\"At least this gives them one major growth project, whereas the cupboard was looking a little bare previously prior to Scarborough and prior to the BHP deal,\\\" Mr Bethune said.\", \"\\\"Any new development like this is significant... it's the biggest oil and gas development in Australia for 10 years.\\\"\", \"Premier Mark McGowan welcomed the announcement and said Scarborough was expected to comply with WA's domestic gas reservation policy, under which gas equivalent to 15 per cent of reserves are sold into the domestic market.\"]","href_hash":"71516a7c4b7711ecae1b05aa430582f7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"71516a7c4b7711ecae1b05aa430582f7"}},
