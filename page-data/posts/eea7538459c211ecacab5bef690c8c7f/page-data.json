Think twice before giving cash, be sure offer thanks, and never ask about a gift you gave but never saw again.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-10T14:11:03.000Z","content":"[\"It has been two years since the holidays felt \\u201cnormal,\\u201d and you\\u2019re determined to make it special. You spend hours combing through your go-to department store, dodging Santa Clauses and unruly crowds to find the right gift. You open and close a dozen browser windows before adding that perfect item to your basket, sending a prayer to the internet gods that it arrives on time. Then, the moment comes to hand over the carefully selected present, tastefully wrapped. But instead of squeals of joy, you\\u2019re met with an anticlimactic \\u201cThank you.\\u201d\", \"How should you respond?\", \"The average American consumer will spend $694 on gifts for others this year, according to Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at GlobalData. That\\u2019s up about 7 percent compared with last year, when gift spending dipped 5.1 percent because of the coronavirus pandemic, which disrupted usual family gatherings during the holidays and caused severe Postal Service delays. Both the number of gifts that consumers plan to give and the number of people they\\u2019re shopping for this year are also higher compared with last year, he said.\", \"With so many gifts changing hands this season, what could go wrong? Plenty, according to Maralee McKee, the founder of the Etiquette School of America in Orlando, Fla., and Colin Cowie, a lifestyle expert who has worked with Oprah Winfrey and others during his 35-year career.\", \"\\u201cI think that when gift giving goes wrong, the person hasn\\u2019t put enough thought into the gift,\\u201d Ms. McKee said.\", \"No matter your role in exchanging gifts, there are many dos and don\\u2019ts. Here\\u2019s what you should know this season.\", \"There\\u2019s a hierarchy when it comes to giving, and it starts with those you\\u2019ve exchanged gifts with in the past for long enough that it\\u2019s a tradition.\", \"\\u201cIn most families, if your parents are still living, the parents will receive a gift,\\u201d Ms. McKee said. \\u201cThe grandparents will receive a gift. After that, it\\u2019s going to vary in every family.\\u201d\", \"Setting a price limit is most useful in office and corporate settings when large groups of people exchange gifts, like Secret Santa, Mr. Cowie said.\", \"Awkward feelings could develop if someone intentionally exceeds the limit, said Ms. McKee, who added that in such cases an explanation should be given.\", \"\\u201cThink of the person you\\u2019re giving the gift to,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBecause too often gifts are bought at the delight of the person giving the gift.\\u201d\", \"Absolutely not. Giving a gift or sending a holiday card in return is not required, Ms. McKee said, but she noted that this time of year people sometimes keep small items they can easily give away when unexpected situations arise.\", \"\\u201cKeep in mind, if you do give them a gift, you\\u2019ve opened the door for the same thing to happen next year,\\u201d she said.\", \"Cash can either alienate or delight the receiver, but it\\u2019s really a matter of personal taste or age (perfect for picky teenagers). It is, however, impolite to ask for cash. \\u201cOtherwise, that\\u2019s a slippery slope because you\\u2019re now soliciting a gift,\\u201d Mr. Cowie said.\", \"Giving cash can work in certain circumstances, but keep in mind the person and your relationship to them.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s fine as long as it\\u2019s not given as an excuse for not having to shop for a gift,\\u201d Ms. McKee said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s probably not the best gift, in fact it\\u2019s incredibly lazy, if someone in a romantic relationship were to give it\\u201d as it could signal putting a price on a relationship.\", \"You don\\u2019t. It\\u2019s customary to accept a gift with gratitude, even if the giver \\u201cmisses the mark,\\u201d Ms. McKee said. And it\\u2019s perfectly fine to regift the item or donate it to someone who may like it more.\", \"When passing along an unwanted gift to someone else, \\u201cExplain the gift, why you received it and why you thought of that person,\\u201d she said. Ms. McKee also noted that a regifted item should not take the place of an actual gift but instead be treated as a bonus present.\", \"After you give a gift, never ask about it, especially if you never see or hear about it again. \\u201cIf the receiver has something to say about it, they\\u2019ll say it,\\u201d Ms. McKee said. \\u201cDon\\u2019t ask, \\u2018How are you enjoying that? Where is the vase I bought you?\\u2019 You\\u2019ll put them in the awkward position of feeling like they need to fib.\\u201d\", \"A person never has to explain why he or she can\\u2019t give a gift, Mr. Cowie said. But if you receive one, he said, do give a proper thanks. \\u201cI find so often that people don\\u2019t respond to gifts,\\u201d he said. Phone calls, text messages or even handwritten notes to acknowledge gifts will do.\", \"On the other hand, it\\u2019s fine to openly discuss why you\\u2019re not exchanging gifts, in order to help others understand your decision, Ms. McKey said. \\u201cThe first rule of etiquette is never assume,\\u201d she said. \\u201cDon\\u2019t assume because they live in a particular home or have a particular job that their finances are neat and tidy, because you don\\u2019t know the whole picture of their life.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"eea7538459c211ecacab5bef690c8c7f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eea7538459c211ecacab5bef690c8c7f"}},
