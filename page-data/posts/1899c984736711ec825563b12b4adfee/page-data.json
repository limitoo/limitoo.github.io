There are two main ways they do this.\", \"The first relies on the fact that stars with planets don't sit motionless in the centre of their solar system. They're pulled into their own small circular or elliptical path by the gravitational tug of their planets.\", \"It's generally too hard for telescopes to see a star's subtle side-to-side shimmy.\", \"But as a star moves away from and towards Earth, its light stretches and becomes redder, then compresses and becomes slightly bluer - a change that telescopes can pick up.\", \"This way of detecting exoplanets is known as the radial-velocity method, or, as University of Southern Queensland astronomer Jonti Horner calls it, the \\\"wobble method\\\".\", \"And it was the dominant way of finding exoplanets for a decade or so after the first confirmed detections in the 1990s.\", \"But spotting these stellar wobbles is labour-intensive, sometimes requiring years of staring at a single star to see if its light appears to get redder and bluer over time.\", \"Enter: the transit - or \\\"wink\\\" - method, the second primary way to detect exoplanets.\", \"If an exoplanet's journey around its star is in Earth's line of sight, we'll see that starlight momentarily, but periodically, dip in brightness.\", \"\\\"The beauty of that is that you can use a wide-field camera and simultaneously measure the brightness of a large number of stars at a time,\\\" Professor Horner said.\", \"\\\"When you're looking at enough stars, you're playing a numbers game.\", \"\\\"Some of them will have planets that are lined up just right that they pass between us and their star every time they go around, and you'll see that star periodically winking.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/136653/eight_col_049_f0235048.jpg?1641935675\\\" alt=\\\"Illustration of the view from the innermost of the two exoplanets orbiting Gliese 667 C (largest star, a red dwarf) in the Gliese 667 system.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nIllustration of the view from the innermost of the two exoplanets orbiting Gliese 667 C (largest star, a red dwarf) in the Gliese 667 system. \\nPhoto: AFP or licensors\\n</div>\", \"The winking method's clocked up more than 3,700 exoplanets; the wobble method's found around 900.\", \"Add to these another 120 exoplanets that were spotted using a technique called gravitational lensing, where light from a star far, far off in the distance bends around an exoplanet.\", \"Only around 50 exoplanets have been directly imaged.\", \"An exoplanet's girth and heft are calculated from its star's wink and wobble too.\", \"A larger exoplanet produces a more substantial star wink, purely because it blocks more light, and an exoplanet's mass is given away by the amount it makes its star wobble.\", \"Factor in how quickly an exoplanet travels around its star, measured by the time between winks, and astronomers can start to get some idea of what it's like out there.\", \"For instance, a sizeable wobble and strong, fast winks points to something like a hot Jupiter - a gas giant that loops around its star quickly and closely.\", \"Once astronomers calculate an exoplanet's mass and size, they can calculate its density, and from there, start to work out what kind of stuff the planet is made from, Professor Horner says.\", \"\\\"Perhaps we can also work out what its internal structure is.\\\"\", \"For instance, a small but massive planet has little choice but to be mostly made from dense material, such as iron.\", \"The transit or wink method of exoplanet detection also has the added bonus of providing clues to atmosphere composition and chemistry.\", \"When an exoplanet momentarily passes between us and its star, a little of that starlight filters through its atmosphere (if it has one), and some of the light is absorbed, UNSW computational chemist Laura McKemmish says.\", \"\\\"What colours of light get through depend on what molecules are there, as well as clouds, and what temperature that atmosphere is,\\\" she says.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/136654/eight_col_049_f0218905.jpg?1641935778\\\" alt=\\\"Illustration of the view from an exomoon orbiting a ringed exoplanet in a polar orbit. \\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nIllustration of the view from an exomoon orbiting a ringed exoplanet in a polar orbit.  \\nPhoto: MARK GARLICK/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY\\n</div>\", \"Once you've got the atmosphere, you can start to think about the biology of the exoplanet, she adds, \\\"rather than it just being a spherical blob\\\".\", \"Telescopes on and orbiting Earth capture that light.
