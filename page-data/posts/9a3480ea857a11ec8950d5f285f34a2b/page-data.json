Rescue workers said women and children were among at least 13 people killed during the raid in Atmeh, a town close to the border with Turkey in rebel-held Idlib Province.\", \"Witnesses described the raid to The Times. One bystander said that U.S. forces issued demands of surrender by loudspeaker to a woman apparently in the house with children, and that he thought missiles were later fired at the house amid hails of gunfire.\", \"U.S. officials, however, said that al-Qurayshi perished by detonating a bomb. Little is known about the ISIS leader, who died as he lived most of his life: off the grid in the jihadist underworld.\", \"Context: The raid came days after a battle over a Syrian prison where ISIS fighters were held, the largest U.S. combat involvement with the Islamic State since the end of the caliphate three years ago.\", \"Officials in the U.S. said Russia was planning to use a fake video showing an attack by Ukrainians on Russian territory or against Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine, designed to fabricate pretext for an invasion of the country.\", \"U.S. officials would not release any direct evidence of the Russian plan or specify how they learned of it, saying to do so would compromise their sources and methods. But a recent Russian disinformation campaign lent credence to the intelligence.\", \"The Kremlin said yesterday that the U.S. plan to send 3,000 additional troops to Eastern Europe over concerns about Ukraine was intended to \\u201cstir up tensions.\\u201d Its spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, described the U.S. deployment to Poland and Romania as a threatening act \\u201cin the vicinity of our borders.\\u201d\", \"Turkey backs Ukraine: Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, agreed to expand Ukraine\\u2019s supplies of a long-range, Turkish-made armed drone whose use in combat for the first time in Ukraine last fall infuriated Russian officials.\", \"International relations: Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, will meet Xi Jinping, China\\u2019s leader, in Beijing today in a highly choreographed display of unity.\", \"Related: As Russia squeezes natural gas supplies, a parade of tankers carrying liquefied natural gas is coming to Europe\\u2019s rescue.\", \"Australia, the government says, is ready to \\u201clive with the virus\\u201d after nearly 95 percent of adults there have been vaccinated. But many people don\\u2019t feel ready to seesaw from an 18-month approach of snuffing out every case to one in which the floodgates are wide open.\", \"When one state announced that it was ending intensive contact tracing, people began to do their own via a Facebook group. After Australia\\u2019s prime minister declared lockdowns a thing of the past, so many residents of Melbourne and Sydney stayed at home as Omicron cases spiked that it was labeled a \\u201cshadow lockdown.\\u201d And despite borders reopening, the travel-loving nation has mostly stayed put.\", \"Asia-Pacific nations are not eager to emulate what Australia has done, with Japan, South Korea and Thailand pausing or rolling back reopenings. New Zealand is taking a more cautious approach, gradually reopening to travelers from abroad over the next nine months.\", \"The numbers: The Omicron tide peaked at 150,000 new daily cases on Jan. 13.

More recently, Pakistani doctors helped to fill a staffing crisis in the National Health Service.\", \"But the aftermath of Sept. 11 opened a Pandora\\u2019s box for British Muslims, including British Pakistanis, with a rise in Islamophobic attacks.

Her 70-year reign has encompassed profound changes, including the shrinking of the country\\u2019s empire, with many historians seeing the Hong Kong handover in 1997 as its last gasp.\", \"Throughout it all, Elizabeth has remained a stalwart of British royal traditions, never relinquishing the formality and pageantry of the role. Yet the actions of her descendants have ushered the royal family into a new chapter, often characterized by more time in the spotlight \\u2014 and a sometimes difficult relationship with the media.\", \"Many will remember the image of the queen grieving alone last year at a physically distanced funeral for Prince Philip, her husband of 73 years.
