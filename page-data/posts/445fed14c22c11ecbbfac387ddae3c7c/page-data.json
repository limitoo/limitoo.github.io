Several players then charged on to the field.\", \"The North Texas Junior College Athletic Conference previously announced Thursday it suspended Woodward for four games, and Phillips also was suspended for two games because he was ejected for taunting.\", \"Weatherford officials have said Woodward could face expulsion from school as the play caught widespread online attention.\", \"Heading into the game, Woodward had a 3.10 ERA, 30 strikeouts and four saves over 20 1/3 innings pitched, CBSSports.com reported.

It also suspended four additional Weatherford players and assistant coaches for two games.\", \"If that leaves North Central Texas without enough players for its next two games against Weatherford, it will have to forfeit, the league said.
