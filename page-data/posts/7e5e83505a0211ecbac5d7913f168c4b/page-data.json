It seemed to be primarily an example of the Ukrainian navy\\u2019s decrepitude, though it\\u2019s possible that Ukraine, too, could have been trying to push the boundaries and provoke Russia.\", \"Either way, the Russian security services and state news media quickly seized on the encounter, portraying it as an imminent threat.\", \"Russia\\u2019s domestic spy service, the F.S.B., announced late in the evening that it had intercepted the ship for failing to obey orders. That set off the Kremlin\\u2019s propagandists, who played up the move as a prelude to war. RT, a Russian government television station, began livestreaming coverage on YouTube under the headline \\u201cUKRAINIAN PROVOCATION,\\u201d with a military analyst suggesting the ship should be blown out of the water.\", \"\\u201cThis is the provocation everyone has been waiting for,\\u201d Andrei Medvedev, an RT contributor wrote.\", \"In the end, it was not, as the vessel returned to port without incident.\", \"A lumbering ship may not yet be enough to provoke a full-on Russian assault. But with Moscow having amassed nearly 100,000 troops on Ukraine\\u2019s borders, along with tanks, fighter aircraft and ballistic missiles, people on all sides of the conflict are jumpy.\", \" The brief flare-up not only underscores the dangers inherent in the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists, but also suggests that the situation remains volatile even after a video call this week between President Biden and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia aimed at ratcheting down tensions.\", \"Mr. Putin\\u2019s rhetoric on Ukraine has become increasingly ominous. And Ukrainian troops are arrayed along a 250-mile barricade of trenches and fortifications that regularly erupts in machine gun and artillery fire as they face off against the separatists in the Donbass region of Eastern Ukraine.\", \"Much is riding on diplomatic efforts in the next days and weeks, experts said.\", \"\\u201cI think that it\\u2019s obviously tense, but it\\u2019s not like we\\u2019re ready to roll,\\u201d said Eugene Rumer, the director of the Russia and Eurasia program at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\", \"Mr. Rumer raised the possibility that, once Russia makes the decision to invade, it could use a minor incident as justification.\", \"\\u201cIf Putin realizes this conversation with Biden is not going anywhere, that he\\u2019s not getting what he wants, that this is hopeless, then I can imagine that a drone incident or a shell that somebody lobs could provide the pretext to pull the trigger,\\u201d he said.\", \"Indeed, the decision by the F.S.B. to intercept a seemingly harmless ship, combined with the furious reaction from the Kremlin\\u2019s propagandists, has unnerved both Ukrainian and western officials, who fear that it serves as a model for how the Kremlin could use a contrived excuse to invade.\", \"Ukrainian observers said they found the timing of the F.S.B.\\u2019s announcement suspicious. It came out around the time the government released the details of a telephone call between Ukraine\\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and President Biden.\", \"In a statement on Twitter, the United States embassy in Kyiv delivered an unusually pointed response, saying that the Ukrainian ship did nothing illegal and accusing the Russian government of intentionally ginning up a controversy.\", \"\\u201cRussia\\u2019s false allegations are part of its ongoing campaign to distract from its latest aggressive, provocative action,\\u201d the embassy wrote.\", \"The ship \\u2014 ironically named Donbas, the heart of the separatist territory \\u2014 was intercepted in the Sea of Azov near the Kerch Straight, a narrow passage near Russian-occupied Crimea over which Ukraine and Russia have repeatedly clashed. In 2018, Russian forces opened fire on several Ukrainian naval vessels and arrested a number of sailors, who they accused of straying into territorial waters that the Kremlin claimed as its own after the annexation of Crimea.\", \"The F.S.B. said the Donbas had refused to obey orders to divert from a course leading to the Kerch Strait. \\u201cThese actions represent a threat to the safety of navigation,\\u201d its statement said.\", \"According to Ukrainian officials, the ship never came closer than 18 nautical miles from the disputed waterway.\", \"Ukrainian and Western officials say that the Russian authorities, including Mr. Putin himself, seem to be previewing their rationalizations for an invasion. This month, Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State, warned that Russia had \\u201cintensified disinformation to paint Ukraine as the aggressor to justify pre-planned military action.\\u201d\", \"These efforts appeared to continue even after the video call between Mr. Putin and Mr. Biden.\", \"In defiance of all evidence to the contrary, Mr. Putin on Thursday accused the Ukrainian authorities of carrying out \\u201ca genocide\\u201d against the residents of the Donbas. Though civilians in the separatist territories live under the protection of Russian-backed military forces, Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of RT and one of the Kremlin\\u2019s chief propagandists, immediately amplified the claims, suggesting she hoped Russia would come to the residents\\u2019 rescue.\", \"\\u201cMother Russia has more than once saved millions from different forms of genocide,\\u201d she wrote on Telegram.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know if he had that in mind,\\u201d she said of Mr. Putin, \\u201cbut I certainly hope he did.\\u201d\", \"The bellicose statements come against the backdrop of continuing violence along the so-called line of control separating Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists. On Thursday, two Ukrainian service members were wounded in attacks on front line positions, the country\\u2019s military\\u2019s press service reported.\", \"Meanwhile, the build-up of Russian troops on the border shows no sign of abating. Russia\\u2019s Defense Ministry announced that tank divisions from the western military district had practiced taking out anti-tank rockets similar to the Javelins provided by the United States and now deployed by Ukrainian forces in the country\\u2019s east. The exercises were held at training grounds in the Voronezh region, less than 200 miles from the Russia-Ukraine border.\", \"Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian General staff, warned in remarks to military attach\\u00e9s on Thursday that worsening tensions in the region could force Russia to respond. In his statement he specifically mentioned Russia\\u2019s opposition to the Javelins, which Ukrainian forces have not yet used on the battlefield, as well as Turkish-made Bayraktar drones, which have been used to attack separatists positions.\", \"\\u201cAny provocation by the Ukrainian authorities to solve the problems of Donbas using force will be suppressed,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"7e5e83505a0211ecbac5d7913f168c4b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7e5e83505a0211ecbac5d7913f168c4b"}},
