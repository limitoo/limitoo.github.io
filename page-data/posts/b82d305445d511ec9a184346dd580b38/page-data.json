tens of thousands of hectares of grazing land and wildlife habitat.\", \"Wolverton Station and Piccaninny Plains Wildlife Reserve had about 15,000 and\\u00a030,000 hectares burned, respectively, over the past three weeks.\", \"Saturday night brought 31 millimetres of rain,\\u00a0which helped, but did not completely extinguished the fires.\", \"An arson investigator from QFES visited the area recently but so far\\u00a0no charges have been laid.\", \"Sally and Graham Gray are devastated at the loss of carbon credits, feed and wildlife habitat at Piccaninny Plains, which they manage on behalf of the Australian Wildlife Conservancy.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/6b2de9d30c5573f6fa4d17d6323e90d1\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

October 29 there were four ignition points through Piccaninny,\\\" Ms Gray said.\", \"\\\"There was a fifth ignition point on Piccaninny the day prior and then right along the Peninsula Development Road\\u00a0on that same day there were fires lit, all from the roadside.\", \"\\\"It becomes pretty apparent that it's something that someone is [deliberately] doing.\", \"<img

working day and night with limited resources\\u00a0to fight the fires on the reserve.(Supplied: Sally Gray, AWC)</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Let people know'</div>\", \"The couple said they were at their wits' end after reporting suspected arson attacks on the property for years without any convictions.\", \"\\u00a0\\\"This has been happening ever since we've been here,\\\" Ms Gray said.\", \"\\\"There's a long history of these unplanned late fires that are not related to lightning strikes.\", \"<img

points, according to Ms Gray.(Supplied: Sally Gray, AWC)</div>\", \"Ms Gray said the motive behind the suspected\\u00a0attacks was unclear and called upon all residents and visitors to report suspicious activity.\", \"\\\"We really need everyone who is moving through the Cape to be a little bit more aware of what's going on,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"If you see a fire and you see someone pulled up on the side of the road in a very odd place \\u2026 take a number plate, let people know.\", \"\\\"Don't assume it's the property managers lighting a fire.\", \"<img

is all too familiar to Daryl Killin.\", \"He has\\u00a0been involved in the Savannah Burning program for many years, trying to bring about change to the fire regime on Cape York.\", \"According to Mr Killin, in a six-year period, a one-third increase in the amount of country subjected to strategic early burning has halved the amount of country burnt in late season fires.\", \"But despite the positive results, Mr Killin believes more resources are needed for fire prevention and fighting on the Cape, which covers an area of more than 10 million hectares.\", \"<img

significant rainforests, woodlands, wetlands and grasslands and iconic wildlife.(Supplied: Sally Gray, AWC)</div>\", \"\\\"These are very remote areas,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"You've often got to fly in there with helicopters and try to attack the fire front directly, which is very difficult to do \\u2026 if you don't have water available to you and a nearby road.\", \"\\\"We increasingly need to look at a more coordinated fire response, fighting these fires using proven techniques such as leaf blowers, that can be used to directly attack the fire at night time when the flame height's low and basically throw a bit of dirt over the front of the fire.\", \"\\\"But in order to do that kind of operation you need to have very good communications, good safety systems and different kinds of training and capability than is traditionally offered through avenues like the bush fire brigades.\\\"\", \"Mr Killin said he believed investment from the state government, along with contributions from the grazing sector and the savannah burning carbon industry could save thousands of hectares each year.\"]","href_hash":"b82d305445d511ec9a184346dd580b38"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b82d305445d511ec9a184346dd580b38"}},
