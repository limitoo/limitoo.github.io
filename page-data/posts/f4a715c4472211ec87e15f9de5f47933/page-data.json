According to the Associated Press, Janey was Boston's first woman and first Black resident to serve as mayor, though she was not elected to it.\", \"Janey took over the role from Marty Walsh, who stepped down to become the U.S. secretary of labor under President Joe Biden.\", \"\\\"City government is special. We are the level closest to the people, so we must do the big and the small, Wu said after taking the oath of office. \\\"After all, Boston was founded on a revolutionary promise: that things don't have to be as they always have been. That we can chart a new path for families now, and for generations to come, grounded in justice and opportunity.\\\"\", \"During her campaign, Wu's promises included pursuing rent stabilization and a fare-free public transit system. In the AP report, Wu said she would work with partners in the state government to try to implement these proposals.\", \"\\\"Not only is it possible for Boston to deliver basic city services and generational change\\u2014it is absolutely necessary in this moment,\\\" Wu said. \\\"We'll tackle our biggest challenges by getting the small things right.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1933604/michelle-wu-boston-mayor.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The election of Michelle Wu marked the first time that Boston voters elected a woman, or a person of color, to lead the city.
