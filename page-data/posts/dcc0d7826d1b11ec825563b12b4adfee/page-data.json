By comparisons, the typical millennial pays $16 a month, while Gen Zers pay $19. The poll also found that younger customers are much more likely to have the type of accounts that charge monthly fees.\\u00a0\", \"Bank overdraft fees in the U.S. have hit an all-time high. In 2021, the average fee for overdrawing your account rose to $33.58, a 22-cent increase over the past two years, according to a different Bankrate analysis. Among major U.S. cities, people living in Baltimore, Houston and Philadelphia paid the highest overdraft fees last year at more than $35. Cincinnati, Los Angeles and St. Louis paid the lowest fees at around $31.\", \"Big U.S. banks have generated about $9 billion annually in revenue from overdraft, ATM and other fees in recent years, according to the\\u00a0Center\\u00a0for Responsible Lending, or CRL.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, are pushing to shrink the amount of revenue banks generate from fees, arguing the charges primarily hit\\u00a0low-income customers\\u00a0and households of color. In response, some banks have eliminated overdraft\\u00a0or ATM fees.\", \"Capital One last month became the largest U.S. bank to say it would ditch overdraft and insufficient fund fees. CEO Richard Fairbank said Capital One made the move to bring \\\"humanity to banking.\\\" Ally Bank announced in June it would\\u00a0no longer charge its $25 overdraft fee\\u00a0for all customers, no matter what type of account they hold.
