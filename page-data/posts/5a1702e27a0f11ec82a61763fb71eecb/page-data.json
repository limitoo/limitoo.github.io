As he watched other drivers use the emergency lane to escape the gridlock, he started fuming about people who put their desires above everyone else\\u2019s, then wondered if such minor ethical lapses even matter.\", \"What started as a flash of irritation yielded an idea: What if there were a cosmic point system that tallied our good and bad behavior, and ranked people accordingly? From then on, when Schur saw drivers misbehaving, he would comfort himself by imagining them losing 15 points on their moral score cards.\", \"That fantasy helped shape the premise for Schur\\u2019s television series, \\u201cThe Good Place,\\u201d a metaphysical comedy set in an afterlife where people are assigned to the Good Place or Bad Place based on their ethical ranking. The show, which starred Kristen Bell as a pathologically selfish pharmaceutical saleswoman accidentally sent to the Good Place, posed complex thought experiments and explored moral principles from philosophers like Aristotle and Kant, all in the framework of a 22-minute sitcom.\", \"\\u201cThe Good Place\\u201d ran for four seasons on NBC and was a commercial and critical success. But when the final season aired in 2020, Schur, who\\u2019s also known for his work on comedies like \\u201cThe Office,\\u201d \\u201cParks and Recreation\\u201d and \\u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine,\\u201d felt unsatisfied.\", \"\\u201cI had this nagging feeling, like I wasn\\u2019t done talking about it,\\u201d Schur said in a video interview from his home in Los Angeles, where he lives with his wife J.J. Philbin, their children William and Ivy, their dogs Henry and Louisa, and a guinea pig named Coco. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t want to try to do another TV show on the same topic, because that just seemed weird. I\\u2019m not sure there\\u2019s another TV show that\\u2019s explicitly about moral philosophy that anyone would be interested in.\\u201d\", \"So, in a somewhat surprising pivot, he decided to write a book about ethics.\", \"Schur\\u2019s debut, \\u201cHow to Be Perfect: The Correct Answer to Every Moral Question,\\u201d which Simon & Schuster will release on Tuesday, is likely the first book about moral philosophy to feature endorsements from Steve Carell, Amy Poehler, Ted Danson and Mindy Kaling. Jeff McMahan, a philosophy professor at Oxford, called it \\u201can enjoyably boisterous guide to the moral life.\\u201d\", \"In about 300 pages, Schur covers some 2,500 years of Western philosophical thought, breaking down concepts like virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism and contractualism, analyzing principles espoused by Aristotle (\\u201ca good salesman, and he gets us all excited about his pitch\\u201d), Kant (\\u201ca pretty rigid dude\\u201d) and Camus (\\u201ca stone-cold hottie\\u201d), and examining arguments from contemporary philosophers like Judith Thomson, Peter Singer, T.M. Scanlon and Johann Broodryk. He raises quandaries that are easy calls (\\u201cShould I Punch My Friend in the Face for No Reason?\\u201d) along with more challenging thought experiments like the Trolley Problem (\\u201cShould I Let This Runaway Trolley I\\u2019m Driving Kill Five People, or Should I Pull a Lever and Deliberately Kill One (Different) Person?\\u201d) and fraught issues like whether it\\u2019s wrong to enjoy art and literature created by people who behave reprehensibly.\", \"As a philosophical layman taking on some of the most profound questions humans have pondered, Schur is, naturally, nervous about how the book will be received. \\u201cI\\u2019m terrified of people who know what they\\u2019re talking about reading it and saying, \\u2018You fool,\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s my greatest fear right now, is that someone is going to read it and out loud, alone in his or her office, say the words, \\u2018You fool.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"At the same time, he felt that as a comedy writer, he could bring a unique lens to the subject.\", \"\\u201cThe smartest people who ever lived have been working really hard for thousands of years to try to explain to us how we can be better people, and how we can improve ourselves, but they wrote so complicatedly and densely and opaquely that no one wants to engage with it,\\u201d Schur said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like a chef had come up with a recipe for chocolate chip cookies that were both delicious and also helped you lose weight, but the recipe was 600 pages long and written in German, and no one read it. And I thought, if we could just translate that to, like, a human language, this would be very helpful.\\u201d\", \"In some ways, the topic felt unavoidable. Schur, 46, has been preoccupied with how to be a good person for as long as he can remember.\", \"\\u201cI have been interested-in-slash-obsessed with the concept of ethics my whole life,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere have been moments when I\\u2019ve confronted something about my own behavior, where I realized I was behaving in a ethically questionable way, or had wandered into some complicated situation, that seemed like I would be better equipped to handle it if I knew what the hell I was talking about, ethically speaking.\\u201d\", \"Writing a book about the quest for ethical perfection, Schur risked coming across as unbearably pedantic or worse, sanctimonious, but he grounds his overviews of abstract doctrines in self-deprecating digressions. He confesses he still has books by Woody Allen on his shelves and hasn\\u2019t been able to renounce him even after allegations of sexual abuse came to light. He describes the self-loathing he would feel whenever he left a tip at Starbucks but paused to make sure that the barista saw him do it. He agonizes over his privileged status as an educated, affluent white man, worries that his hybrid car is still bad for the environment and frets that the money he spends on baseball tickets and other luxuries could have gone to people in need. (He\\u2019s donating his earnings from the book to several charities and nonprofits, he said.)\", \"Born in Ann Arbor, Mich., and raised in Connecticut in a casually Unitarian family, Schur has had a charmed career that he attributes to a series of lucky accidents, beginning with the day he stayed home sick from school and his mom let him watch Allen\\u2019s movie \\u201cSleeper.\\u201d At Harvard, where he majored in English, he joined the Lampoon, a comedy magazine that has served as a pipeline for TV writers, and those connections helped him land a job as a writer for \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d in 1998.\", \"He was later hired as a writer for \\u201cThe Office,\\u201d and around the third season, he signed an overall deal with NBCUniversal. He went on to cocreate \\u201cParks and Recreation\\u201d and \\u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine,\\u201d both wholesome workplace comedies. When the network gave him free rein to make a show about anything he wanted, he pitched \\u201cThe Good Place.\\u201d\", \"Early on, he ran into a problem: He didn\\u2019t know much about moral philosophy. So he started a self-taught course in ethics, reading works by Aristotle, Kant, Mill, Bentham, Rawls and others, and devouring academic papers he found online.\", \"When he found concepts to be impenetrable, he sought out professionals. He asked Pamela Hieronymi, a philosophy professor at U.C.L.A, to be an adviser for the show, and she gave lectures in the writers room and guided writers through conundrums like the Trolley Problem. \\u201cHe wants it to be digestible, but he doesn\\u2019t want to water it down,\\u201d she said of Schur.\", \"Schur also brought on the philosopher Todd May as a consultant after reading his book, \\u201cDeath.\\u201d Schur would sometimes send May an urgent email with a \\u201cphilosophical emergency\\u201d when he was worried he had bungled some ethical nuance.\", \"\\u201cHe is extraordinarily precise, and it\\u2019s really important to him to get the theories right,\\u201d said May, who also advised Schur on his book.\", \"The production sometimes felt more like a grad-school philosophy seminar than a sitcom set. William Jackson Harper, who played a conflicted philosophy professor on \\u201cThe Good Place,\\u201d recalled having conversations with Schur about thorny variations on the Trolley Problem that made his head spin. Bell, who studied the long document that Schur prepared outlining different ethical theories that the show covered, remembers having a discussion with Schur about whether it was OK to eat almonds.\", \"\\u201cThere aren\\u2019t a lot of people that have a commitment to examining their role in the world as deeply as he does,\\u201d she said.\", \"Danson, who played an immortal being and bureaucrat who operates the Good Place, said Schur brought seriousness and intensity to the set, an atmosphere that was unusual for a show that also trafficked in bathroom humor and physical comedy. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s a casual bone in his body,\\u201d Danson said.\", \"After creating a show that seemed to defy the boundaries of a sitcom, blending heady concepts with extreme silliness, Schur felt he had discovered a winning formula that he could deploy in a book. He sold \\u201cHow to Be Perfect\\u201d to Simon & Schuster in early 2020, just before the pandemic arrived and shut down much of the entertainment industry.\", \"As its release approaches, Schur is aware that he faces higher expectations than most debut authors. \\u201cI wanted the book to be conversational and engaging and funny enough so that people who had watched \\u2018The Good Place\\u2019 or anything else I\\u2019ve ever done felt like the same guy was talking to them, and I also wanted anyone who knows anything about philosophy to read it and think, like, hey, not bad,\\u201d he said.\", \"He\\u2019s somewhat reassured by the fact that \\u201cThe Good Place\\u201d was so well received, suggesting that there\\u2019s an audience for goofy riffs on ethics, and said he\\u2019s gotten positive responses from friends and colleagues who loved the show and the dilemmas it raised.\", \"\\u201cAnd if they were lying, then that\\u2019s their problem,\\u201d Schur added, \\u201cbecause they\\u2019ve been unethical.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"5a1702e27a0f11ec82a61763fb71eecb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5a1702e27a0f11ec82a61763fb71eecb"}},
