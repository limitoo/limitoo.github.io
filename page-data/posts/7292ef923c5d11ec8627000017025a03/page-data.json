At 4 p.m. ET, the 8-0 Cincinnati Bearcats were listed at +4000, the fifth-best odds in the country to win the national championship.\", \"By later in the evening, though, Cincinnati had dropped to the next spot at +5000 for what appeared to be no significant reason. Additionally, the team sat in these spots despite being ranked No. 2 in both the AP Top 25 poll and the AFCA coach's poll.\", \"Despite this, though, the odds were greater among other teams that were below the undefeated Bearcats in those polls, including the Oregon Ducks and Ohio State Buckeyes, both of whom have lost games.\", \"Another surprise concerned one of college football's most significant rivalries\\u2014the University of Michigan and Michigan State University. The two had played each other this past weekend, with the Michigan Wolverines falling to MSU's Spartans in an exciting back-and-forth affair.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1924990/fcs-logo.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A view of the NCAA Division I FCS logo can be seen on a banner during a college football game. </div>\", \"With the loss, Michigan drops to a 7-1 record, while the Spartans remain perfect with an undefeated 8-0 record. Beyond this, MSU is ranked No. 5 in the AP Top 25 poll, while Michigan dropped to ninth.\", \"Despite losing, however, the Wolverines ended up sitting one spot ahead of the Spartans in Fanduel's betting odds. While both teams have listed odds of +8000, Michigan has the seventh spot, with MSU in the eighth spot.\", \"The Michigan State Spartans have had the spotlight on them since the game because of running back Kenneth Walker III, who 24/7 Sports said had \\\"clinched\\\" a spot as a Heisman Trophy finalist.\", \"Despite the confusion among the odds, the consensus top spot among betters remains the same: The University of Georgia. The UGA Bulldogs have been dominant all season and are listed at -110 to win the national championship, the only team in the negative.\", \"Another big team to watch for is the Alabama Crimson Tide. The perennial contender has sat at number 3 in the AP Top 25 poll for a while, but still occupies great odds at +360.\", \"The Crimson Tide's only loss came in a dramatic upset, falling to Texas A&M in the final seconds of that game. However, despite this, they are still considered by many to have a great chance to reach the title game.\", \"The 2022 CFB Playoff National Championship will be played on January 10 at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana.\"]","href_hash":"7292ef923c5d11ec8627000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7292ef923c5d11ec8627000017025a03"}},
