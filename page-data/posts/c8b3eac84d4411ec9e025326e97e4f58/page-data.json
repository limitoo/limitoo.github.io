The pressure on hospitals relates to other consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, the authorities said.\", \"The staffing shortage, largely driven by the pandemic, has contributed to the loss of approximately 500 medical, surgical and I.C.U. hospital beds in Massachusetts, according to the state. And hospitals are seeing an influx of patients who need more complex treatment for health issues because they delayed visiting the doctor when Covid cases were higher.\", \"The order, issued on Tuesday, applies to hospitals that have less than 15 percent of beds available, and applies only to procedures that are scheduled in advance and can be delayed without having a negative effect on patients\\u2019 health. It does not apply to urgent and essential procedures.\", \"The authorities said the order would help prepare for the annual increase in hospitalizations typically seen after Thanksgiving and through January.\", \"Marylou Sudders, the state\\u2019s secretary of health and human services, said in a statement on Tuesday: \\u201cCovid hospitalizations in Massachusetts remain lower than almost every other state in the nation, but the challenges the health care system face remain, and this order will ensure hospitals can serve all residents, including those who require treatment for Covid-19.\\u201d\", \"In Massachusetts, new cases have risen from an average of about 1,300 early this month to more than 2,800, and hospitalizations are up 47 percent increase over the past 14 days, according to a New York Times database. As of Wednesday morning, 740 people were hospitalized for Covid-19, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.\", \"\", \"State officials worked with the Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association to develop the guidelines. Dr. Eric Dickson, the board chair of the association and the president and C.E.O. of UMass Memorial Health, said in a statement: \\u201cWhile we recognize that delaying some prescheduled surgeries may present a significant hardship for patients, we believe it is a necessary step to assure that all of the Commonwealth\\u2019s hospitals can continue to meet the needs of patients requiring emergency care.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c8b3eac84d4411ec9e025326e97e4f58"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c8b3eac84d4411ec9e025326e97e4f58"}},
