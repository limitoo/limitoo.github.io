Like Keys\\u2019s decision to no longer wear makeup in public, the album is in part a pushback against phony, superficial perfection. \\u201cI used to live hidden in a disguise,\\u201d she sings in \\u201cPlentiful,\\u201d an affirmation of both religious faith and faith in herself that opens the album.\", \"\\u201cKeys\\u201d also exposes the options available to a 21st-century musician, the countless digital tweaks and variations. It\\u2019s a double album with 21 songs, eight of them appearing twice. It begins with \\u201cOriginals,\\u201d tracks that Keys largely produced by herself, followed by \\u201cUnlocked\\u201d: alternate versions produced by Keys with the hitmaker Michael Williams II, who bills himself as Mike WiLL Made-It. Though the whole album is a studio production, \\u201cOriginals\\u201d has a home-alone spirit, while \\u201cUnlocked\\u201d heads for the car and the club. Each half tells a different story about how songs move listeners, physically and emotionally.\", \"The songs themselves explore desire, love and loneliness. Throughout her career, Keys has mingled the personal and the political, often invoking a woman\\u2019s strength and determination. But for most of \\u201cKeys,\\u201d she plays a woman in thrall to her feelings, by turns connected, needy, amorous, giving, desolate, jealous, and, eventually, healing. Most of the songs vamp through a handful of chords as Keys gives her voice room to leap, to curl, to muse, to syncopate; she has rarely sounded so jazzy and improvisatory.\", \"The track list of \\u201cKeys\\u201d isn\\u2019t completely symmetrical. Each half of the album varies the sequence and includes unique songs. But anyone can now reshuffle an album, and \\u201cKeys\\u201d invites every listener to think like a producer, hearing the possibilities of timbre, propulsion, weight and context for every sound, while making clear how much those choices matter.\", \"The \\u201cOriginals\\u201d half of the album promises intimacy. Unlike her 2020 album, \\u201cAlicia,\\u201d which involved dozens of collaborators, \\u201cKeys\\u201d usually brings in just a handful of musicians for each song. There\\u2019s still plenty of audio illusion in her \\u201cOriginals\\u201d versions, with samples (like the Sade drumbeat in \\u201cBest of Me\\u201d), multitracked backup vocals and scratchy-vinyl sound effects. Yet those songs determinedly conjure small, private spaces as she sings her way through mixed emotions. In the tearful \\u201cDead End Road\\u201d she\\u2019s desperately trying to save a failing relationship, hinting at Aretha Franklin in a gospel-style call-and-response with a choir that seems to be coming from inside her own head, still encouraging her to \\u201ctry to make it.\\u201d\", \"In \\u201cOnly You,\\u201d Keys declares, \\u201cI am nothing without you here\\u201d over reverberating piano chords, with the tempo fluctuating as if each line is occurring to her on the spot, though a band eventually joins her. And in \\u201cIs It Insane,\\u201d Keys is at the piano, leading a vintage-style jazz trio through complex chords as she sings about obsessing over an ex, deepening the grain of her voice like a latter-day Billie Holiday or Nina Simone while she begs, \\u201cTake away the pain.\\u201d\", \"The \\u201cUnlocked\\u201d productions put Keys back into the digital grid that often defines current pop. After a gauzy intro, the second version of \\u201cOnly You\\u201d announces the changeover with a steady-thumping beat and digitally chopped-up bits of piano and lead vocal along with sound effects, including sirens and a gunshot. It\\u2019s a sign of what\\u2019s to come: heftier beats, vocal phrases crisped into hooks, guest appearances (like a nonchalant Lil Wayne spot on \\u201cNat King Cole,\\u201d a song that challenges its hearer to become \\u201cunforgettable\\u201d).\", \"The \\u201cUnlocked\\u201d tracks have virtues of their own. They push Keys\\u2019s voice upfront, with a sharper focus. They give Keys a confident strut when she\\u2019s enjoying the romance in \\u201cSkydive\\u201d and \\u201cLove When You Call My Name,\\u201d and they shift \\u201cOld Memories,\\u201d a 1950s-tinged song about what music can trigger, from regret toward resilience. Mike Will also deploys little background interjections \\u2014 a vocal snippet, a saxophone flourish, a handful of plucked guitar notes \\u2014 as ingenious, near-subliminal attention-grabbers.\", \"But the \\u201cUnlocked\\u201d songs sound like public performances, neat and armored and solidly 4/4, more locked than unlocked. The \\u201cOriginals\\u201d hint at freer, messier, closer, unresolved feelings, daringly unguarded \\u2014 and thoroughly, openly human.\"]","href_hash":"ead5136859c211ecacab5bef690c8c7f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ead5136859c211ecacab5bef690c8c7f"}},
