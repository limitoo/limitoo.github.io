But it also prioritises specific goals set down in the strategy to be completed by 2025,\\\" Allan said.\", \"\\\"The implementation plan signals greater coordination of conservation effort to achieve the goals of the biodiversity strategy - ecosystems and indigenous species thrive, people are enriched through their connection with nature, prosperity and a thriving biodiversity are linked, and M\\u0101ori are exercising their role as rangatira and kaitiaki\\\".\", \"According to the Ministry of Conservation, 4000 of New Zealand's species are threatened or in risk of extinction, almost 30 percent of the country's terrestial species.\", \"The lack of information for individual species makes it hard for Department of Conservation to assign a conservation status. 37 percent of the country's indigenous land species are considered to be 'data deficient'.\", \"\\\"We've already reached a few 'getting the system right' milestones. We now have an Oceans Secretariat to support the government's commitment to a more holistic, integrated approach to managing our oceans. M\\u0101ori are being supported through Jobs for Nature to partner or lead biodiversity restoration projects that meet their aspirations,\\\" Allan said.\", \"Climate change should also be included in the strategy. The annual average temperature in Aotearoa has increased in 1.13 degrees Celsius in the last century.\", \"In the past 22 years, New Zealand had its five warmest years on record, with annual average temperatures above 13 degrees Celcius, according to Stats NZ.\", \"Minister of Climate Change James Shaw says the strategy will also help meet its climate change targets.\", \"\\\"Tackling the biodiversity crisis goes hand-in-hand with tackling the climate crisis. But for decades, successive governments have approached these issues separately.\", \"\\\"We are changing that to better harness the power of nature to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also help us adapt to the impacts of climate change\\\".\", \"The strategy will be reviewed and updated as new information and data comes in, including any emerging threats.\", \"The ministry says that the plan will be reviewed every five years to evaluate its progress and impact in New Zealand's biodiversity.\"]","href_hash":"ba624f28c0f811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ba624f28c0f811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
