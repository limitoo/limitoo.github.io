Trump never appeared in public with Glenn Youngkin, Virginia\\u2019s new Republican governor-elect. Other than delivering a six-minute speech during a conference call with supporters on Monday and issuing a few written statements, Mr. Trump was not that involved in Mr. Youngkin\\u2019s campaign. \", \"But that did not stop him and his supporters from claiming, mere hours after the race was called, that Mr. Youngkin could not have won the election without the former president and his legions of supporters.\", \"A little after 9 a.m. on Wednesday, Mr. Trump called into the John Fredericks Radio Show and, in typically grandiose fashion, claimed most of the credit.\", \"\\u201cWithout MAGA, he would have lost by 15 points or more,\\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to the shorthand he and his supporters use for the Trump movement. \\u201cInstead of giving us credit, they say, \\u2018Oh he\\u2019s more popular than Trump.\\u2019 It\\u2019s unbelievable.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Fredericks, who served as Mr. Trump\\u2019s Virginia campaign chairman during his presidential campaigns, said multiple times during the interview that he agreed. \\u201cIf there was no Trump in this election, there\\u2019s no Glenn Youngkin,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Youngkin in a news release in May \\u2014 but only after the Republican had secured his party\\u2019s nomination. The two men did not know each other and are not close. Republicans were concerned that the former president\\u2019s interference in the race could cost Mr. Youngkin in a state that voted for Mr. Biden by 10 percentage points.\", \"Mr. Youngkin kept his distance from Mr. Trump even as he leaned into issues that are popular with Trump supporters, including exaggerated claims of lax security around elections. \", \"After the interview, Mr. Trump\\u2019s office issued a single-sentence news release. It was Mr. Fredericks\\u2019s comment about the former president\\u2019s supposedly pivotal role in the race.\"]","href_hash":"b1e080f43cb911ec919f000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b1e080f43cb911ec919f000017025a03"}},
