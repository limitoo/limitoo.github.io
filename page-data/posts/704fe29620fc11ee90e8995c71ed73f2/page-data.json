He was taken to a hospital, where he remained in stable condition Wednesday with injuries including a collapsed lung.\", \"Cell doors on most federal prison units are typically open during the day, letting prisoners move around freely within the facility. Because Nassar was attacked in his cell, the incident was not captured on surveillance cameras, which only point at common areas and corridors.\", \"McMillan, 49, told prison workers that he attacked Nassar after the sexually abusive ex-U.S. gymnastics team doctor made a comment about wanting to see girls playing in the Wimbledon women's match, the person said.\", \"The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the attack or the ongoing investigation and did so on the condition of anonymity.\", \"Messages seeking comment were left with lawyers who've represented McMillan in his past cases.\", \"Sunday's attack was the second time Nassar has been assaulted in federal custody. He is serving decades in prison for sexually abusing athletes, including college and Olympic gymnastics stars, and possessing explicit images of children.\", \"The attack underscored persistent problems at the federal Bureau of Prisons, including violence, short staffing and an inability to keep even its highest profile prisoners safe.\", \"The Bureau of Prisons insists that there was adequate staffing at the prison where Nassar was stabbed, about 46 miles (74 kilometers) northwest of Orlando, though documents obtained by the AP show one-third of correctional officer positions remain unfilled at the prison.\", \"In a statement Wednesday, the agency said it was \\\"imperative that we increase our staffing levels\\\" and said it was recruiting officers and using financial incentives to try to retain workers. Officials said they are also still working to \\\"tackle the problem violence in our facilities\\\" and have enhanced their security procedures, but would not provide details.\", \"\\\"The BOP takes seriously our duty to protect the individuals entrusted in our custody, as well as maintain the safety of correctional staff and the community,\\\" agency spokesperson Scott Taylor said.\", \"McMillan is scheduled to be released from prison in May 2046, according to a Bureau of Prisons inmate database and court records, though that could change if he is charged and convicted of attacking Nassar.\", \"McMillan was originally sentenced to more than 20 years in federal prison after pleading guilty in Wyoming to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine in 2002. He had been expected to be released next year before his convictions for the Louisiana and Colorado prison attacks more than doubled his sentence.\", \"McMillan arrived at the Coleman, Florida, penitentiary last December, according to records obtained by the AP. He'd spent the previous four years at a federal penitentiary in Tucson, Arizona, following stints at federal prisons in Allenwood, Pennsylvania, and adjacent to the Supermax lockup in Colorado, the records show.\", \"Nassar was transferred to Coleman from the Tucson penitentiary in August 2018. His lawyers said he'd been assaulted within hours of being placed in general population at the Arizona prison.\"]","href_hash":"704fe29620fc11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"704fe29620fc11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
