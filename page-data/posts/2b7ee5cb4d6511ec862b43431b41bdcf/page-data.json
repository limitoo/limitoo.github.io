So the major impact was that volume of upfront urgent stuff and it had the effect of pushing out hearing so that our aged cases became increasing aged.\", \"Te Korowai Ture \\u0101-Wh\\u0101nau, which laid out 69 recommendations to improve the court, also acknowledged delay is endemic and impacts on almost every other issue in family justice services.\", \"Judge Moran said delay was especially concerning for the family jurisdiction as cases often involved relationship breakdowns and the arrangements of the care of children.\", \"\\\"If [families] are impacted by mental illness or methamphetamine the landscape can change and by the time it gets to hearing then you're dealing with a whole raft of issues that weren't there initially.\", \"\\\"The longer that people are apart and within a court process the more acrimonious they become and the more difficult it is to get them to focus on what might meet their children's needs because while they may be separated as partners they are parents for a long time and that damage can be irreparable if we can't get to it quickly.\\\"\", \"Shorter-term measures to reduce delay included the development of Family Court associates, a quasi-judicial role, who would oversee administrative cases to free up judges for those more complex.\", \"Judge Moran also said almost all of the 50 approved Kai\\u0101rihi, or Family Court 'navigators', are also in place to ensure families who need mediation, counselling or help from community agencies don't end up in court unnecessarily.\", \"The Family Court was established in 1981 as New Zealand's first therapeutic court but some working in the system have told RNZ it is failing to live up to this purpose.\", \"Judge Moran didn't agree and said she believes the court is fulfilling its therapeutic mandate but can always do better and wants to do better.\", \"She said Te Ao M\\u0101rama \\\"fits very neatly\\\" within the Family Court and expects this new court model will eventually be rolled out in every Family Court.\", \"She and other judges had been visiting courts to meet with judges, lawyers, iwi, police and other agencies who frequent the Family Court, like Oranga Tamariki.\", \"\\\"I think that generally people are excited about it and they understand the importance of it.
