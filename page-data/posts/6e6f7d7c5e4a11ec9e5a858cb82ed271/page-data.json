Within an hour, her inventory (about 20 pairs) had sold, including a Nike Air Jordan 1 design priced at $7,500.\", \"By then, Ms. Hall had learned what incited the rush: the announcement that Virgil Abloh, the designer of Off-White and the men\\u2019s artistic director for Louis Vuitton, was dead at 41 after a private battle with a rare cancer.\", \"In the immediate aftermath, sales and searches for Mr. Abloh\\u2019s designs reportedly surged on resale websites. But prices also surged, as seen on StockX, the \\u201cNasdaq for Sneakerheads,\\u201d where sellers set asking prices and buyers can place bids. While Mr. Abloh designed a range of clothes and accessories for Off-White and Louis Vuitton \\u2014 as well as water bottles for Evian and home goods for Ikea, among other curiosities \\u2014 the sneakers he released in collaboration with Nike have long been a fixation in the overactive sneaker market.\", \"On StockX, for example, a pair of Jordan 1\\u2019s were sold on Nov. 28, the day of Mr. Abloh\\u2019s death, for $10,500; in the rest of the month, the shoe\\u2019s price had not exceeded $7,549. (It was originally priced $190 in retailers in 2017.)\", \"To people familiar with Mr. Abloh\\u2019s legacy, this came as no surprise. He had been someone who could deftly pull the strings of the hype machine, and built the bridge between street wear and high fashion \\u2014 and did it all \\u201cin limited supply,\\u201d said Caitlin Donovan, who oversees handbags, street wear and sneakers at Christie\\u2019s Americas.\", \"\\u201cObviously the secondary market was going to see a huge spike,\\u201d she said.\", \"But the surge also raised ethical questions \\u2014 not just for the large and somewhat faceless middleman platforms like StockX and Goat, but also for the comparatively smaller players in the sneaker game watching as prices skyrocketed.\", \"It was a dilemma that Jaysse Lopez of Urban Necessities, a large Las Vegas consignment store that sold more than 300 pairs of Off-White shoes on the day Mr. Abloh died, first considered a few years ago. He was having a conversation with his wife (and co-owner) about how people can manipulate the market when someone with a loyal following dies.\", \"\\u201cI raised the question of, Was it fair for items to jump two, three, four or five times what they were worth before the demise of that person?\\u201d Mr. Lopez said. \\u201cSo I basically built in restrictions.\\u201d\", \"If his consignors want to change their pricing, Mr. Lopez allows no more than a 15 percent increase without manager approval, a system that was first tested, he said, after the death of Kobe Bryant, another Nike collaborator, when sneaker resellers were scrutinized for profiting off renewed interest in his line.\", \"Mr. Lopez also happens to be a collector of Mr. Abloh\\u2019s work. About a week before the designer\\u2019s death, he hosted a pop-up shop with eBay in Detroit, where he displayed \\u201cthe 50,\\u201d a series of 50 Nike Dunk Lows designed with Off-White that took him more than two months and $27,000 to collect. It may have been the first time all 50 had been exhibited in public by a private collector. (He has no plans to sell.)\", \"\\u201cI understand that the value goes up, but it also has to be within reason,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI just think from a moral standpoint that the focus in the first few minutes or hours shouldn\\u2019t be on \\u2018How much can I capitalize off this?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"At Sneak City, which does not consign but has a buy-sell-trade model, Ms. Hall did not modify pricing between hearing of Mr. Abloh\\u2019s death and selling out of his products, she said (unlike many StockX sellers).\", \"Since then, the store has replenished some of its inventory of previously owned Off-White sneakers, and prices are up.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s the nature of the sneaker market,\\u201d Ms. Hall said. \\u201cWhen people come in now to sell shoes, we look at StockX as the price reference, and we\\u2019ve upped our offers to reflect the market.\\u201d\", \"When Ms. Donovan at Christie\\u2019s learned of Mr. Abloh\\u2019s death, she initially wanted to remove a large lot of Nike x Off-White sneakers set to be auctioned in December, \\u201cout of respect,\\u201d she said. (Consigned in October, the lot\\u2019s estimated value started at $60,000.) Ultimately, she decided not to advertise the listing or put it on social media.\", \"Still, people found the listing, and Mr. Abloh\\u2019s death brought \\u201covernight a huge jump in bidding,\\u201d Ms. Donovan said. The auction closed on Dec. 9 at $62,500.\", \"Tracking the market today, Ms. Donovan said the initial frenzy has calmed, but she expects resale value to remain strong. (The heightened StockX prices gradually fell in the days after Mr. Abloh\\u2019s death, though they appear, from listings of recent sales, to be generally higher than when Mr. Abloh was alive.)\", \"\\u201cThe idea of not being able to have a part of his larger impact in fashion I think made people really want to go out and get a piece of it,\\u201d Ms. Donovan said. \\u201cFor some of the bigger pieces, it\\u2019s going to stay that way. If anything, as we get farther away from the new designs, it could even go upward.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6e6f7d7c5e4a11ec9e5a858cb82ed271"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6e6f7d7c5e4a11ec9e5a858cb82ed271"}},
