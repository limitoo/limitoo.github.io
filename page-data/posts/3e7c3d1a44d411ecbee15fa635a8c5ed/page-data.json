Officials believe the python slithered aboard when the vessel was anchored near Indian Key, which is located by the Everglades.\", \"\\\"Marco Island Police responded and made quick work of wrangling the reptile...Out of an abundance of caution the vessel was removed from the marina,\\\" the marina wrote on Facebook.\", \"The police department said in a social media post that they transferred the intruder into custody of local wildlife handler Bobby Monroe.
