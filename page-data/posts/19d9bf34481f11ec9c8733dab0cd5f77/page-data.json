When he did not do so quickly, because he has metal rods and pins in his leg and hip, an officer stomped on the back of his head.\", \"The man, Clarence Gailyard, 58, will now receive $650,000 in compensation from Orangeburg, S.C., the city announced on Wednesday.\", \"Body camera footage from July 26 shows Mr. Gailyard being stopped by Officer David Lance Dukes. The officer points a gun at Mr. Gailyard, who is on his hands and knees.\", \"In the video, Mr. Dukes, who was later fired, yells, \\u201cGet on the ground!\\u201d He then stomps on Mr. Gailyard, causing his forehead to hit the ground.\", \"Mr. Gailyard sustained a head injury. He was stopped by the police that day after \\u201can erroneous 911 call placed stating someone out there had a gun,\\u201d his lawyer, Justin Bamberg, said.\", \"Mr. Gailyard, who has had rods and pins in his body since being struck by a vehicle while riding a bicycle a few years ago, was holding a piece of wood wrapped in duct tape that he used to keep stray dogs away when he went walking, Mr. Bamberg said.\", \"In a statement on Wednesday, the city said that in addition to an apology, Mr. Gailyard would receive the compensation paid by the city\\u2019s insurance carrier. City officials said that the city would also establish a citizens\\u2019 task force to \\u201cprovide oversight and guidance with regard to interactions\\u201d between residents and the Orangeburg police.\", \"Sidney Evering, the Orangeburg city administrator, said in a statement that the \\u201cvast majority\\u201d of the city\\u2019s police officers \\u201cdo their jobs with honor and ensure that the citizens they are entrusted to protect and serve are treated fairly and with respect.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cHowever, when an officer falls short of these expectations and conducts themselves in ways unbecoming to their department and the city, that officer must and will be held accountable. That\\u2019s exactly what we have done in this instance.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Dukes was fired after an investigation into the encounter and was charged with first-degree assault and battery. His lawyer and the Orangeburg Department of Public Safety did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday night.\", \"At a news conference in August, Mr. Gailyard said he was still in pain. \\u201cEvery time I look in the mirror and see the scar on my face, it is not OK,\\u201d he said.\", \"In a statement to the city on Wednesday, Mr. Bamberg said that Mr. Gailyard was \\u201cpleased to put this very troubling incident behind him.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe appreciate how quickly Orangeburg city leadership moved to make this right by Mr. Gailyard,\\u201d Mr. Bamberg said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve handled numerous cases involving police violence previously, and rarely have I seen a city swiftly accept responsibility and also work to ensure that this never happens to another person.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Bamberg said he gave credit to Aqkwele Polidore, a sergeant who was at the scene in July, \\u201cwho refused to cover for a co-worker.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis incident should give all good officers around the country a positive sign that it is OK to take a stand against police brutality in your agencies,\\u201d Mr. Bamberg said. \\u201cAmazing things can happen when dedicated law enforcement officers choose what\\u2019s right over what\\u2019s \\u2018blue.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Mr. Bamberg also credited the city of Orangeburg for \\u201cchanging its police department for the betterment of both its own officers and the citizens it serves.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis is what progress looks like,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"19d9bf34481f11ec9c8733dab0cd5f77"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"19d9bf34481f11ec9c8733dab0cd5f77"}},
