While we all continued to grapple with urgent developing news about the coronavirus, climate change and global politics, authors widened the aperture, publishing books on a dizzying number of subjects: the history of Black artists in the film industry; an American woman who joined the Nazi resistance in Germany; midcentury creative ferment in New York City; the groundbreaking mathematician Kurt G\\u00f6del; the playwright Tom Stoppard. Other books told the stories of an 18th-century Irish poem, the \\u201cfirst civil rights movement,\\u201d one modest cotton sack that reflects the immense trauma of slavery. We read about gay nightlife and Juneteenth and Watergate, and all of this doesn\\u2019t nearly cover the entire list.\", \"In fiction and poetry, it was a year of well-established names delivering strong work, with new novels from Rachel Cusk, Jonathan Franzen, Colm Toibin, Dana Spiotta, Gary Shteyngart and Katie Kitamura, brilliant second novels by Atticus Lish and Asali Solomon, and a vital collection of poems about history and mortality by Rita Dove.\", \"Below, selections by The New York Times\\u2019s daily book critics of their favorite titles from the past 12 months. The choices come from our four staff critics, Dwight Garner, Jennifer Szalai, Molly Young and Alexandra Jacobs, as well as Parul Sehgal, who was a critic for The Times until July of this year.\", \"An annual note on methodology: The critics limit themselves in this process, each choosing only from those books he or she reviewed for The Times since last year at this time. For more of their thoughts about what they read in 2021, you can read\\u00a0their related roundtable discussion. \\u2014\\u00a0John Williams\", \"REIGN OF TERROR: How the 9/11 Era Destabilized America and Produced Trump, by Spencer Ackerman. (Viking.) Spencer Ackerman contends that the American response to 9/11 made President Trump possible. He presents the evidence for this thesis with an impressive combination of diligence and verve, guiding us through two decades and showing how any prospect of national unity in response to 9/11 buckled under the incoherence of the wars that followed. The resulting narrative, our critic Jennifer Szalai wrote, is \\u201cupsetting, discerning and brilliantly argued.\\u201d \", \"\", \"TRAVELING BLACK: A Story of Race and Resistance, by Mia Bay. (The Belknap Press of Harvard University.) In this superb history, the question of literal movement becomes a way to understand the civil rights movement writ large. \\u201cOnce one of the most resented forms of segregation, travel segregation is now one of the most forgotten,\\u201d Bay writes. Szalai wrote that Bay is \\u201can elegant storyteller, laying out the stark stakes at every turn while also showing how discrimination wasn\\u2019t just a matter of crushing predictability but often, and more insidiously, a haphazard jumble of risks.\\u201d \", \"\", \"JOURNEY TO THE EDGE OF REASON: The Life of Kurt G\\u00f6del, by Stephen Budiansky. (Norton.) The mathematician Kurt G\\u00f6del upended his profession\\u2019s assumptions with his \\u201cincompleteness theorem,\\u201d presented in 1930, when he was 24. But expertise in formal logic isn\\u2019t essential for anyone\\u2019s enjoyment of this moving biography. Budiansky brings a polymath\\u2019s interest to bear on a man whose life intersected with the political and philosophical upheavals of the 20th century. An \\u201cemphasis on the human and humane implications of G\\u00f6del\\u2019s life and work,\\u201d Szalai wrote, \\u201cgives this book its mesmerizing pull.\\u201d \", \"\", \"THE COPENHAGEN TRILOGY: Childhood; Youth; Dependency, by Tove Ditlevsen. Translated from the Danish by Tiina Nunnally and Michael Favala Goldman. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux.) Ditlevsen, who died in 1976, is beloved in her native Denmark. This one-volume collection of three memoirs is the portrait of an artist and an addict. Ditlevsen writes about her early years and her beautiful, capricious and cruel mother; the joy and necessity she found in writing poetry; and the dark ecstasy of discovering the opioid Demerol. \\u201cThere is a quality of trance, of autohypnosis, in her style,\\u201d Parul Sehgal wrote. \\u201cThey exert a particular fascination, these books. It\\u2019s like watching something burn.\\u201d\", \"\", \"KING RICHARD: Nixon and Watergate: An American Tragedy, by Michael Dobbs. (Knopf.) This kaleidoscopic book manages to find fresh drama in the story of Watergate. Dobbs\\u2019s entry in a crowded field distinguishes itself in part by limiting its narrative mostly to the first hundred days after Nixon\\u2019s second inauguration. \\u201cThis circumscribed frame allows Dobbs to deploy his observational gifts to full effect,\\u201d Szalai wrote. From a vast amount of raw material, he has \\u201ccarved out something intimate and extraordinary, skillfully chiseling out the details to bring the story to lurid life.\\u201d\", \"\", \"ALL THE FREQUENT TROUBLES OF OUR DAYS: The True Story of the American Woman at the Heart of the German Resistance to Hitler, by Rebecca Donner. (Little, Brown.) This book about Mildred Harnack, an American woman sentenced to death by the Nazi regime in 1943, is a family history too: Donner is Harnack\\u2019s great-great-niece. It is also a story of code names and dead drops, a real-life thriller with a cruel ending. Donner pieces together Mildred\\u2019s life from fragments, sifting through government archives, interviews, photographs, diaries and letters. Szalai called it an \\u201castonishing\\u201d book that conveys \\u201cwhat it felt like in real time to experience the tightening vise of the Nazi regime.\\u201d\", \"ON JUNETEENTH, by Annette Gordon-Reed. (Liveright.) Gordon-Reed, a Pulitzer-winning historian best known for her work\\u00a0on Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, takes a more personal approach in her latest book. In a series of short, moving essays, she explores \\u201cthe long road\\u201d to June 19, 1865, when the end of legalized slavery was announced in Texas, the state where Gordon-Reed was born and raised. Szalai wrote that the book displays Gordon-Reed\\u2019s \\u201cability to combine clarity with subtlety,\\u201d and to show that \\u201chistorical understanding is a process, not an end point.\\u201d\", \"COLORIZATION: One Hundred Years of Black Films in a White World, by Wil\\u00a0Haygood.\\u00a0(Knopf.) \\u201cColorization\\u201d tells the story of Black artists in the film industry, those in front of and behind the camera. It moves from the pioneer Oscar Micheaux through the careers of Paul Robeson, Dorothy Dandridge and Lena Horne, and up to the work of Spike Lee, Ava DuVernay and Jordan Peele. \\u201cThis is sweeping history, but in Haygood\\u2019s hands it feels crisp, urgent and pared down,\\u201d our critic Dwight Garner wrote. \\u201cHe carries you along on dispassionate analysis and often novelistic detail.\\u201d\", \"PATRICIA HIGHSMITH: Her Diaries and Notebooks, 1941-1995, edited by Anna von Planta. (Liveright.) In Patricia Highsmith\\u2019s diaries and notebooks, we see the young writer \\u2014 the future author of \\u201cStrangers on a Train,\\u201d the Ripley series and many other novels \\u2014 learning to mediate between her intense appetite for work and her need to lose herself in art, gin, music and warm bodies. \\u201cHighsmith is pointed and dry about herself and everything else,\\u201d Garner wrote. \\u201cBut the early chapters are special. They comprise one of the most observant and ecstatic accounts I\\u2019ve read \\u2014 and it\\u2019s a crowded field! \\u2014 about being young and alive in New York City.\\u201d\", \"SOLID IVORY: Memoirs, by James Ivory. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux.) The movie director James Ivory is closely associated with paeans to inhibition like \\u201cHowards End\\u201d and \\u201cThe Remains of the Day.\\u201d So his sexual frankness in this memoir might come as a surprise. He writes about his work with his romantic and producing partner, Ismail Merchant, and their close collaborator, the writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Our critic Alexandra Jacobs wrote: \\u201cAfter decades conjuring the Anglo-American aristocracy clinking cups in gardens and drawing rooms, Ivory, the survivor, is ready to spill the tea.\\u201d \", \"PLUNDER: A Memoir of Family Property and Nazi Treasure, by Menachem Kaiser. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.) Menachem Kaiser, the descendant of Polish Jews, grew up in Toronto. \\u201cPlunder\\u201d is about what happens after he takes up his Holocaust-survivor grandfather\\u2019s battle to reclaim an apartment building in Sosnowiec, Poland, that the family owned before the war. \\u201cKaiser is a reflective man on the page, with a lively mind,\\u201d Garner wrote. He \\u201ctells a twisting and reverberant and consistently enthralling story. It\\u2019s a weird story that gets weirder.\\u201d\", \"TOM STOPPARD: A Life, by Hermione Lee.\\u00a0(Knopf.) Now 84, Tom Stoppard has led an enormous life. Hermione Lee, the acclaimed biographer of Virginia Woolf, Edith Wharton and others, has wrestled it all onto the page. Stoppard\\u2019s best-known plays include \\u201cRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\\u201d \\u201cArcadia\\u201d and \\u201cThe Coast of Utopia.\\u201d He co-wrote the screenplay for \\u201cShakespeare in Love.\\u201d Garner called Lee\\u2019s effort \\u201castute and authoritative,\\u201d and said: \\u201cOne reason this book entertains is that Stoppard has had an opinion about almost everything, and usually these opinions are witty.\\u201d \", \"GAY BAR: Why We Went Out, by Jeremy Atherton Lin. (Little, Brown.) Jeremy Atherton Lin began writing this restless and intelligent cultural history of queer nightlife in 2017; more than half of London\\u2019s gay bars had shuttered in the previous 10 years. But the book is not an elegy. Broken into sections, each devoted to a particular bar and city, it tells of how clubs have disappointed the author as well as welcomed, astonished, exasperated and intimidated him. \\u201cThe treatment of time in the book \\u2014 the way the present is peeled back to reveal the past \\u2014 is beautiful, and original,\\u201d Sehgal wrote. \", \"IN THE EYE OF THE WILD, by Nastassja Martin. Translated from the French by Sophie R. Lewis. (New York Review Books.) In 2015, the anthropologist Nastassja Martin barely survived an attack by a bear in the mountains of Kamchatka, in eastern Siberia. This slender yet expansive book is her haunting, genre-defying memoir of the year that followed. She writes about the attack; about her work among the Indigenous Even people; and about philosophy, questioning the human propensity to try to assimilate everything into familiar terms. \\u201cWhat Martin describes in this book,\\u201d Szalai wrote, \\u201cisn\\u2019t so much a search for meaning as an acceptance of its undoing.\\u201d \", \"UNTIL JUSTICE BE DONE: America\\u2019s First Civil Rights Movement, From the Revolution to Reconstruction, by Kate Masur. (Norton.) This revelatory book is about the \\u201cfirst civil rights movement\\u201d \\u2014 the fight for Black people\\u2019s freedom and equality from the Revolutionary War to Reconstruction. One of its themes is how African Americans led the struggle, even as racially discriminatory laws made them vulnerable. \\u201cIf this is a cleareyed book, it\\u2019s still a heartening one,\\u201d Szalai wrote. \\u201cMasur takes care to show not only the limitations of what was achieved at each step but also how even the smallest step could lead to another.\\u201d \", \"ALL THAT SHE CARRIED: The Journey of Ashley\\u2019s Sack, a Black Family Keepsake, by Tiya Miles. (Random House.) This recent winner of the National Book Award for nonfiction is about women and chattel slavery as framed by a single object: a cotton sack that dates back to the mid-19th century, given by an enslaved woman named Rose to her daughter Ashley. Little about the sack is definitively known. Miles tries to learn and reconstruct what she can. Szalai wrote: \\u201cThe trauma of separation emerges as a central theme of the book, as Miles tries to imagine herself into the lives of the women she writes about.\\u201d \", \"A GHOST IN THE THROAT, by\\u00a0Doireann Ni Ghriofa. (Biblioasis.) The 18th-century Irish noblewoman Eibhlin Dubh Ni Chonaill composed the great poem \\u201cCaoineadh Airt Ui Laoghaire\\u201d after her husband was murdered by a powerful British official. The poet Doireann Ni Ghriofa\\u2019s book, which includes her translation of the poem, is a hybrid of essay, biography, autofiction and scholarship \\u2014 and a daily accounting of life with four children under the age of 6. \\u201cThe book is all undergrowth, exuberant, tangled passage,\\u201d Sehgal wrote. \\u201cThe story that uncoils is stranger, more difficult to tell, than those valiant accounts of rescuing a \\u2018forgotten\\u2019 woman writer from history\\u2019s erasures or of the challenges faced by the woman artist.\\u201d \", \"THE LOFT GENERATION: From the de Koonings to Twombly: Portraits and Sketches 1942-2011, by Edith Schloss. Edited by Mary Venturini. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux.) The German American writer and artist Edith Schloss\\u2019s memoir was discovered in rough-draft form after her death in 2011, and it\\u2019s been polished into a glowing jewel of a book. It recalls a Who\\u2019s Who of art-world characters, including Willem and Elaine de Kooning, Leo Castelli and Merce Cunningham. \\u201cAll five senses are shaken awake\\u201d by the book, Jacobs wrote. \\u201cIf nostalgia is a sixth and often fogging sense, it is absent in a book that feels manifestly present, clear and alive even while describing the past.\\u201d \", \"THE RIGHT TO SEX: Feminism in the Twenty-First Century, by Amia Srinivasan. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux.) In these rigorous essays, Amia Srinivasan wants nothing less, she writes, than \\u201cto remake the political critique of sex for the 21st century.\\u201d This is fraught terrain, and she treads it with determination and skill, writing about pornography and the internet, misogyny and violence, capitalism and incarceration. She also makes space for ambivalence, idiosyncrasy, autonomy and choice. \\u201cSrinivasan has written a compassionate book. She has also written a challenging one,\\u201d Szalai said. \\u201cShe coaxes our imaginations out of the well-worn grooves of the existing order.\\u201d \", \"THE EMPATHY DIARIES: A Memoir, by Sherry Turkle.\\u00a0(Penguin Press.) In this warm, intimate memoir, the clinical psychologist Sherry Turkle writes about her childhood in postwar Brooklyn; Radcliffe and Harvard in the late 1960s, when she was an undergraduate; and Paris in the early 1970s, where she studied the work of (and got to know) the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. This is \\u201ca beautiful book,\\u201d Garner wrote. \\u201cIt has gravity and grace; it\\u2019s as inexorable as a fable; it drills down into the things that make a life.\\u201d \", \"PESSOA: A Biography, by Richard Zenith. (Liveright.) Fernando Pessoa, the Portuguese poet, critic, translator, mystic and giant of modernism, published a few books that went mostly unnoticed during his lifetime. After his death in 1935, a trunk was discovered, brimming with his true life\\u2019s work, written not only by Pessoa but by a flock of his personas (he created dozens of them, including a doctor, a classicist, a bisexual poet, a monk, a lovesick teenage girl). Zenith\\u2019s book is \\u201cmammoth, definitive and sublime,\\u201d Sehgal wrote. He has \\u201cwritten the only kind of biography of Pessoa truly permissible, an account of a life that plucks at the very borders and burdens of the notion of a self.\\u201d \", \"SECOND PLACE, by Rachel Cusk. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux.) Rachel Cusk\\u2019s first novel since she concluded her acclaimed Outline trilogy is about M, a sharply observant middle-age writer who lives with her second husband on a remote piece of property. She invites L, a famous younger painter whose work she admires, to come and stay in their \\u201csecond place,\\u201d a cabin that\\u2019s an artist\\u2019s retreat of sorts. L arrives with a beautiful young girlfriend in tow, and the novel becomes a swirling hothouse. \\u201cIt\\u2019s as if Cusk has been reading Joyce Carol Oates\\u2019s best novels,\\u201d Garner wrote. \\u201cShe digs into the gothic core of family and romantic entanglements.\\u201d \", \"PLAYLIST FOR THE APOCALYPSE: Poems, by Rita Dove. (Norton.) Rita Dove\\u2019s new collection is about the weight of American history, and it\\u2019s also about mortality. It\\u2019s the first time she has publicly acknowledged that she has had a form of multiple sclerosis for more than 20 years. Some of these poems address health troubles. Some are about Martin Luther King Jr., Robert F. Kennedy, Muhammad Ali and Barack Obama. Garner called the poems \\u201camong her best,\\u201d and wrote: \\u201cDove\\u2019s books derive their force from how she so deftly stirs the everyday \\u2014 insomnia, TV movies, Stilton cheese, rattling containers of pills \\u2014 into her world of ideas and intellection, in poems that are by turns delicate, witty and audacious.\\u201d \", \"CROSSROADS, by Jonathan Franzen.\\u00a0(Farrar, Straus & Giroux.) Jonathan Franzen\\u2019s new novel, which starts a trilogy, is set in suburban Chicago. At its center are the Hildebrandts, another of the author\\u2019s seemingly solid Midwestern families. The patriarch, Russ Hildebrandt, is the local church\\u2019s idealistic associate pastor. Throughout the novel each of the major characters suffer crises of faith and of morality. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a mellow, marzipan-hued \\u201970s-era heartbreaker,\\u201d Garner wrote. It\\u2019s \\u201cwarmer than anything he\\u2019s yet written, wider in its human sympathies, weightier of image and intellect. If I missed some of the acid of his earlier novels, well, this one has powerful compensations.\\u201d\", \"INTIMACIES, by Katie Kitamura.\\u00a0(Riverhead Books.) Katie Kitamura\\u2019s fourth novel is about an unnamed woman who goes to work as an interpreter at an international court at The Hague. She\\u2019s in flight from New York City, where her father recently died. Like nearly everyone in this novel, she leads a globalized, deracinated life. At work, she interprets for \\u2014 and thus climbs inside the heads of \\u2014 notorious criminals. The novel\\u2019s heat lies in Kitamura\\u2019s abiding interest in the subtleties of human power dynamics. \\u201cIntimacies\\u201d is \\u201ccoolly written and casts a spell,\\u201d Garner wrote. \\u201cThe light it emits is ghostly, like that from under the lid of a Xerox machine.\\u201d\", \"THE WAR FOR GLORIA, by Atticus Lish.\\u00a0(Knopf.) \\u201cThe War for Gloria\\u201d is a solemn, punishing, kinetic portrait of a mother and son facing her mortal illness. The book\\u2019s protagonist, Corey, grows up all but fatherless in and around Boston and seeks ways to prove himself. He tends to his mother, Gloria, this book\\u2019s great, glowing presence, who has Lou Gehrig\\u2019s disease and only a few years to live. Garner said the novel \\u201cmore than pays off on the promise\\u201d of Lish\\u2019s debut, \\u201cPreparation for the Next Life,\\u201d\\u00a0which won the 2015 PEN/Faulkner award. It is \\u201cpowerful, intelligent, brooding and most of all convincing; it earns its emotions.\\u201d\", \"\", \"THE MAGICIAN, by Colm Toibin.\\u00a0(Scribner.) This subtle and substantial novel imagines the life of Thomas Mann, the Nobel Prize-winning author of \\u201cDeath in Venice\\u201d and \\u201cThe Magic Mountain,\\u201d among other classics. Garner called it a \\u201csymphonic and moving\\u201d work. \\u201cToibin seeks to grasp the entirety of Mann\\u2019s life and times, the way a biographer might, and he does so quite neatly. Maximalist in scope but intimate in feeling, \\u2018The Magician\\u2019 never feels dutiful. Like its subject, it\\u2019s somber, yet it\\u2019s also prickly and strange, sometimes all at once.\\u201d \", \"OUR COUNTRY FRIENDS, by Gary Shteyngart (Random House.) Gary Shteyngart\\u2019s new novel begins at the onset of the pandemic, with seven friends and one nemesis gathered at an estate in the Hudson Valley to wait out what they\\u2019re sure will be a quick blip in their convenient and prosperous lives. Predicaments abound, mysteries multiply and betrayals proliferate. Our critic Molly Young wrote that the book is \\u201cbrilliant about so much: the humiliations of parenting and of being parented; the sadism of chronic illness; the glory of friendship.\\u201d It is \\u201ca perfect novel for these times and all times.\\u201d\", \"\", \"THE DAYS OF AFREKETE, by Asali Solomon. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux.) Asali Solomon\\u2019s novel is a reverie, a riff on \\u201cMrs. Dalloway\\u201d and a love story. Liselle, its protagonist, is a Black woman living in Philadelphia. Her husband, who is white, cut corners while running for the state legislature, and the F.B.I. is closing in on him. We meet Liselle on the evening of a dinner party she is hosting after her husband\\u2019s decisive political defeat. In the back of her mind is a college girlfriend whose life veered in a sorrowful direction. Young wrote: \\u201cSolomon has a way of taking class lines that are often invisible and turning them into one of those laser museum security systems that you see in heist movies: neon, treacherous, uncrossable.\\u201d\", \"\", \"WAYWARD, by\\u00a0Dana Spiotta. (Knopf.) For Sam Raymond, the restless heroine of Dana Spiotta\\u2019s latest novel, menopause is reason enough to re-evaluate everything. Her body revolts just as her mother is starting to ail and her teenage daughter is growing remote and secretive. Sam is rash, funny, searching, entirely unpredictable. \\u201cWayward\\u201d is a \\u201cfurious and addictive\\u201d novel, Sehgal wrote. \\u201cSo much contemporary fiction swims about in its own theories; what a pleasure to encounter not just ideas about the thing, but the thing itself \\u2014 descriptions that irradiate the pleasure centers of the brain, a protagonist so densely, exuberantly imagined, she feels like a visitation.\\u201d\", \"In addition to our staff critics, Sarah Lyall, Janet Maslin and John Williams also review on occasion throughout the year, and here are some of the books they admired most in 2021.\", \"Lyall said that Simon Rich's latest collection of comic stories, \\u201cNew Teeth,\\u201d shows off the author\\u2019s \\u201cantic imagination\\u201d and \\u201cdelicious wit.\\u201d She was taken with Herv\\u00e9 Le Tellier\\u2019s \\u201cThe Anomaly,\\u201d a novel about the strange and mysterious fate of an international flight and its passengers, in which \\u201chigh entertainment meets serious literature.\\u201d\", \"Maslin wrote that Colson Whitehead\\u2019s heist novel, \\u201cHarlem Shuffle,\\u201d has \\u201cdialogue that crackles\\u201d and \\u201ca final third that nearly explodes.\\u201d She raved about Joshua Ferris\\u2019s \\u201cA Calling for Charlie Barnes,\\u201d describing it as his \\u201cmost dazzling\\u201d book so far. And she praised Jake Tapper\\u2019s \\u201cThe Devil May Dance,\\u201d a thriller set in glamorous locations: \\u201cThe seriousness of this book never gets in the way of the breathless fun.\\u201d\", \"Williams admired Christine Smallwood\\u2019s debut novel, \\u201cThe Life of the Mind,\\u201d about an adjunct professor. It\\u2019s driven by a constant flow of incisive psychological and social observations.
