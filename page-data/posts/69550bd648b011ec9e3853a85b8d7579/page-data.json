Jurors in Minneapolis deliberated for roughly 10 hours over two days in April before convicting Derek Chauvin, a former police officer, of charges including second-degree murder for killing George Floyd.\", \"A Florida jury weighed charges against George Zimmerman for more than 16 hours before acquitting him in 2013 of counts including second-degree murder for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin.\", \"It took about 35 hours over nine days for jurors in California to acquit the actor Robert Blake in 2005 of murdering his wife. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t read anything into it in terms of the length of the deliberations other than it\\u2019s so intensely stressful for the parties,\\u201d said Ion Meyn, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Law School.\", \"Mr. Meyn noted that Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s defense has sought to limit the number of times jurors could rewatch videos while prosecutors argued for unlimited viewing. That makes sense, Mr. Meyn said, because his lawyers would more likely want jurors to focus on Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s testimony.\", \"The defense lawyers\\u2019 best case is \\u201cif the jury believes what comes out of their client\\u2019s mouth,\\u201d Mr. Meyn said. As the hours have passed in Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s case, long stretches with no word from the jury have been punctuated by the parties being called back to court for notes from the jury, arguments over motions and other matters.\", \"The time taken and the jury\\u2019s request for the video evidence suggest the panel is using an evidence-based approach that is more likely to lead to a thorough deliberation and less likely a deadlock, said Valerie Hans, a professor at Cornell Law School who has extensively studied the jury system.\", \"Juries will sometimes take a \\u201cverdict-driven\\u201d approach in which people state their opinions early in deliberations, she said. \\u201cIf you say right away, \\u2018guilty\\u2019 or \\u2018not guilty\\u2019 you\\u2019ve made something of a public commitment\\u201d to a position that is less likely to change, Ms. Hans said.\", \"That approach is more likely to lead to a hung jury, she added.\", \"Mr. Rittenhouse, his family members and lawyers have holed up in a room one floor up from the courtroom where Bruce Schroeder, a Kenosha County Circuit Court judge, has been working through other cases while he waits.\", \"Not knowing what jurors are thinking takes a toll, said John A. Birdsall, a Milwaukee-based lawyer who is not involved in Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s trial but has endured jury deliberations lasting up to a week.\", \"He said he has spent those stretches trying to work on his other cases. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very nerve-racking. You\\u2019re trying to parse every question that comes down to gauge where they\\u2019re at,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut, of course, it\\u2019s all just guess work.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"69550bd648b011ec9e3853a85b8d7579"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"69550bd648b011ec9e3853a85b8d7579"}},
