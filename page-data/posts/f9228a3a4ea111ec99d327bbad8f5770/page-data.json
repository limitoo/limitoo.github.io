Its energetic star and creator wants to know what’s next.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-26T10:17:53.000Z","content":"[\"LOS ANGELES \\u2014 The past year in California has been the driest in a century. But on a recent mid-November afternoon, California was starting to look a lot like \\u2026 Ireland.\", \"At least it was in the edit bay for \\u201cIt\\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\\u201d where visual effects artists were diligently tweaking the color scheme to better resemble that of the Emerald Isle. Slowly, the parched cliffs of Bodega Bay began to look like the grassy Slieve League cliffs. The golden, dusty hills of Sonoma County took on the verdant, rain-soaked hues of County Donegal. Several episodes of the coming season are set in Ireland, where they were also supposed to be shot before the pandemic intervened. That meant adding a lot of green and gray in post.\", \"Clad in a black T-shirt emblazoned with a raised fist in support of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Rob McElhenney jumped up from the couch, as if yanked by an invisible string. He poked the screen with a decisive finger.\", \"\\u201cCan we make the mountain closer to a darker rock?\\u201d He sat down, then jumped up again. \\u201cCan we darken the sky?\\u201d Then again. \\u201cIs that enough of a pinnacle?\\u201d\", \"A big sigh. A pause. \\u201cI love this job,\\u201d he said.\", \"Offscreen, McElhenney, who created and stars in \\u201cSunny,\\u201d is in the midst of his own transformation, and it\\u2019s a lot harder when what you\\u2019re poking at is yourself. When the show returns to FXX for its 15th season on Wednesday, it will officially dethrone \\u201cThe Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\\u201d as the longest running live-action comedy series in American TV history, and it has already been renewed through Season 18.\", \"For McElhenney, it\\u2019s a milestone. But it\\u2019s also a midpoint, and a cause for reflection.\", \"He\\u2019s embarking on what he calls \\u201cthe second half\\u201d of his career. Thanks largely to the longevity of \\u201cSunny,\\u201d he is financially set for life \\u2014 he doesn\\u2019t really need to do anything more. And yet, in the past two years, he has cocreated and stars in the Apple TV+ comedy \\u201cMythic Quest\\u201d; codeveloped and sold a third, to-be-announced scripted show; recorded a \\u201cSunny\\u201d recap podcast; and is currently filming the docu-series \\u201cWelcome to Wrexham,\\u201d which will chart his journey as the new co-owner of a Welsh soccer team.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m only 44,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo, am I going to sit back and just wait to die?\\u201d\", \"Those who know McElhenney know complacency was never an option. They describe him as \\u201cthe most driven man I\\u2019ve ever met\\u201d (\\u201cSunny\\u201d executive producer and star Charlie Day); \\u201cthe captain that you want on your ship\\u201d (his \\u201cSunny\\u201d co-star and wife of 13 years, Kaitlin Olson); and \\u201cthe \\u2018Rocky\\u2019 soundtrack in human form\\u201d (Megan Ganz, who created \\u201cMythic Quest\\u201d with McElhenney and Day and is also an executive producer on \\u201cSunny\\u201d).\", \"Indeed, the boundaries between work and home seem blurry. Earlier that morning, McElhenney had ushered me into a detached home office behind the house he and Olson share with their two sons in Brentwood. His work space, loosely inspired by a Pennsylvania log cabin, was recently enhanced with a section of the Paddy\\u2019s Pub set \\u2014 complete with stools, flooring and a football-helmet-shaped neon sign \\u2014 that he paid the \\u201cSunny\\u201d art department to install.\", \"A voracious reader \\u2014 or, more often, listener \\u2014 of memoirs by successful people (recent selections include one by the Nike co-founder Phil Knight), McElhenney speaks with a measured, academic eloquence. He pauses only to sip water from an oversized Mason jar or tend to Moose, his and Olson\\u2019s rescue cat, who has a penchant for breaking the \\u201cno countertops\\u201d rule.\", \"He\\u2019s not actually funny. Or so he repeatedly insists. And he is given more to soft-spoken contemplation than to punch lines as he drifts through philosophical musings about power and ethics, about where he\\u2019s from and where he\\u2019s heading.\", \"\\u201cSometimes I find myself doing too many things because I\\u2019m just like, Oh, I\\u2019m here, and I have this opportunity and this access \\u2014 I want to take it all before I die,\\u201d he said, adding later: \\u201cAt what point does the accumulation of experience become greedy?\\u201d\", \"The McElhenney origin story he tells is a hero\\u2019s journey built in the grand tradition of the American dream: An outsider from a working-class Philadelphia family defies the odds to charm the Hollywood suits and achieve huge success with his buddies by his side.\", \"Growing up in South Philly, McElhenney clung to TV comedies as a source of escape and connection. When he was 9, his mother moved out to be with the woman who is now his stepmother, and he and his two younger siblings sought stability in NBC\\u2019s Thursday night lineup, religiously watching \\u201cThe Cosby Show\\u201d and \\u201cFamily Ties\\u201d with their father. During weekends at their moms\\u2019 house, it was \\u201cGolden Girls.\\u201d\", \"Acting was initially a last resort. Small and not athletic but longing deeply for connection, the teenage McElhenney eventually abandoned his attempts to play a sport at his all-boys Catholic high school and answered the siren song of a nearby sister school, which needed boys for its production of No\\u00ebl Coward\\u2019s \\u201cBlithe Spirit.\\u201d After a brief stint at Temple University, he moved to New York and eventually Los Angeles to pursue acting.\", \"The idea for one of TV\\u2019s most successful comedies was born modestly enough, coming to McElhenney in the middle of the night in 2004, two years after he moved to Los Angeles. He envisaged a scene in which a guy knocks on his friend\\u2019s door to ask for some sugar for his coffee. The friend tells him he has cancer. The first guy is really sorry to hear that \\u2014 but he still needs the sugar.\", \"As McElhenney put it, if the \\u201cmaxim\\u201d of \\u201cFriends\\u201d was \\u201cI\\u2019ll be there for you,\\u201d then the one for \\u201cSunny\\u201d would be \\u201cI\\u2019ll never be there.\\u201d\", \"While living in a converted West Hollywood garage and working as a waiter, McElhenney approached his fellow aspiring actors Day, Glenn Howerton and Jordan Reid (then McElhenney\\u2019s girlfriend) with a script, and they shot the original pilot for \\u201cSunny\\u201d on a hand-held camcorder. They shopped it around and, according to McElhenney, the fledgling FX offered the best chance for the team to retain creative control and to do the low-budget show their way.\", \"\\u201cIt was absolutely, 100 percent not what I was looking for,\\u201d John Landgraf, who was then president of entertainment at FX, said as he emphasized McElhenney\\u2019s total lack of experience as a writer, producer or showrunner. \\u201cBut it was funny. He had a voice.\\u201d\", \"FX paid them to shoot a more polished pilot and suggested it might have a better chance of standing out if they changed the characters from a group of self-involved actors in Los Angeles to a group of self-involved bar owners in McElhenney\\u2019s native Philadelphia.\", \"As McElhenney, Howerton and Day waited to hear if the show would be picked up, FX came back with a question: Would they be willing to hire a different actress for the sole female lead, Sweet Dee, who served originally as a moralizing foil?\", \"The guys agreed to find someone else, and Reid, who by then had split with McElhenney, was bumped, an experience she described in a 2016 essay for Observer as feeling like a betrayal by her friends. (Reid no longer begrudges the men for seizing their opportunity, she wrote in an email, and she and McElhenney each now say that they are once again friends. FX declined to comment on the casting issue.)\", \"Olson auditioned and won the part, which was then reworked to match the debauchery of the male characters.\", \"\\u201cRob actually apologized to me that they didn\\u2019t do that already,\\u201d Olson said. \\u201cHe definitely had a vested interest in making this character equal to the male characters, and it was very refreshing at the time.\\u201d\", \"Sixteen years after its debut, \\u201cSunny\\u201d remains resolutely committed to its brand of crass nihilism in an age of kinder, gentler comedies like \\u201cTed Lasso\\u201d and \\u201cSchitt\\u2019s Creek.\\u201d But while \\u201cSunny\\u201d remains intent on \\u201csatirizing ignorance,\\u201d as McElhenney put it, he also admits there have been missteps, like the treatment of a recurring transgender character, who was referred to as a slur in a way that made it seem as if the show, rather than the characters, was advocating her mistreatment.\", \"\\u201cWe can\\u2019t retroactively change things,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhat we\\u2019ve done is adjust for them.\\u201d\", \"For example, McElhenney\\u2019s character, Mac, went on a rocky coming out journey across Seasons 11 to 13 that then culminated in a tonal shift as he performed a poignant, four-and-a-half-minute interpretive dance after revealing his sexuality to his imprisoned father.\", \"And then there was the blackface. In the wake of last year\\u2019s nationwide racial justice protests, Hulu, which streams \\u201cSunny\\u201d in the United States, removed several episodes that depict characters, including McElhenney\\u2019s, in blackface. Rather than let the episodes disappear from collective memory, however, the \\u201cSunny\\u201d team confronted them in a Season 15 episode that dives into issues of cancel culture, atonement and white saviorism as the characters film their latest sequel to the \\u201cLethal Weapon\\u201d franchise.\", \"This time, however, there are Black actors instead of blackface \\u2014 including Geoffrey Owens, best known for playing Elvin on \\u201cThe Cosby Show,\\u201d who had appeared in earlier episodes and in \\u201cMythic Quest.\\u201d The new episode also has a Black director (Pete Chatmon) and Black co-writer (Keyonna Taylor).\", \"Over the last few years, public discourse and their own evolving thinking convinced McElhenney and the rest of the creative team that they should diversify the show\\u2019s perspectives, though it was initially unclear how that would serve their bigoted main characters.\", \"\\u201cAt its foundation, it\\u2019s a show about five ignorant, white people, right?\\u201d McElhenney said. \\u201cSo, at first we thought, well, how does it even make sense to have different points of view in there?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThen we were like, Oh my God, of course,\\u201d he added. \\u201cWho could better understand how it feels to be in the wake of ignorant white people than people who aren\\u2019t ignorant white people? Ignorant white men, specifically.\\u201d\", \"Women and people of color have increasingly been added to the \\u201cSunny\\u201d fold, a course McElhenney continued when staffing and casting \\u201cMythic Quest,\\u201d which was recently renewed for a third and fourth season. A workplace comedy set at a video game company, it stars McElhenney as an egomaniacal game creator opposite Charlotte Nicdao, a Filipina-Australian actress in her first major Hollywood role.\", \"Beyond McElhenney\\u2019s diversification efforts, Nicdao and Ganz said, he has also worked hard to offer guidance and opportunities for people who perhaps didn\\u2019t have as clear of a path forward in the industry as he did.\", \"\\u201cAs a woman, I\\u2019ve always felt uncomfortable asking anyone to take time out of what they\\u2019re doing to teach me something,\\u201d Nicdao said. \\u201cThe thing that Rob has done is create this environment where I\\u2019ve never had to ask.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI have, for the first time, considered, oh, maybe I want to produce,\\u201d she added. \\u201cMaybe I want to direct. Maybe I would actually be capable of that.\\u201d\", \"Likewise, Ganz, who met McElhenney when she joined \\u201cSunny\\u201d as a writer and co-producer in 2016, said it was McElhenney who pushed her to make her directorial debut, in the second season of \\u201cMythic Quest.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cRob\\u2019s like a supportive bully, in that he encourages you very aggressively to step outside of your comfort zone,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe believes in you maybe a few feet further than you believe in yourself.\\u201d\", \"His belief in others overflows from the abundance of confidence he has long had in himself and in his ideas. And that self-confidence is infectious. A few years ago, the actor Ryan Reynolds slid into McElhenney\\u2019s DMs. He was a fan of \\u201cSunny,\\u201d and they developed an online friendship strong enough for McElhenney to ask Reynolds if he wanted to join him in buying a Welsh soccer club called Wrexham and make a documentary series about the experience. This was before they had even met in person.\", \"Reynolds said yes, and they\\u2019re currently shooting \\u201cWelcome to Wrexham,\\u201d for FX. It\\u2019s about a an underdog soccer team but also about \\u201ccommunity and what we inherit and what we leave behind,\\u201d McElhenney said \\u2014 the type of big-picture questions he often finds himself pondering in the hours between his 5 a.m. wake up time and his current nightly routine of drinking a large Manhattan and rewatching \\u201cSuccession.\\u201d\", \"As earnest as McElhenney is about the generous aspect of his second act \\u2014 using his own success to create security and opportunity for others \\u2014 he is aware that he\\u2019s partly motivated by self-interest. By elevating new talent around him, he is making his own projects better. It also makes him feel good.\", \"\\u201cAm I doing it all in the service of something positive or good? I\\u2019d like to say that the answer is yes,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut sometimes, if I\\u2019m being honest with myself, maybe it is just that I don\\u2019t know what it is I\\u2019m looking for. Maybe when I find it, I\\u2019ll know.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f9228a3a4ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f9228a3a4ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}},
