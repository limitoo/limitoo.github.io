At a televised ceremony in the presidential palace, he signed a deal with the military intended to end a bloody standoff that has led to dozens of protester deaths and threatened to derail Sudan\\u2019s fragile transition to democracy.\", \"The 14-point agreement met with a wave of anger on the streets. Vocal critics slammed it as an unacceptable concession to a military that has controlled Sudan for 52 years of its 60-year history and that has sought to weaken the democracy transition from the start in 2019. Police officers fired tear gas and live bullets at jeering protesters.\", \"Hamdok will be allowed to form his own government, said a Western official familiar with the negotiations, though important points of contention between the two sides have not been worked out, including crucial arrangements for sharing power.\", \"Analysis: \\u201cHamdok preferred to become the secretary of a dictator over a symbol of an emancipatory movement,\\u201d said Magdi el-Gizouli of the Rift Valley Institute, a research body in East Africa. \\u201cWhoever marketed this as realpolitik underestimated the depth of the desire for change, and a new future, among the new generation in Sudan.\\u201d\", \"Protesters and activists in Barcelona are pushing back against foreign investment firms such as Cerberus, Blackstone and Lone Star, which have bought up thousands of homes in Spain and are now forcing out residents who can\\u2019t pay the rent after suffering financially during the pandemic.\", \"In some cases, protesters have physically blocked lawyers and accompanying police officers from gaining entry to buildings where they intend to force people from their homes. As residents are pushed out of apartments, the group sends squatters to occupy properties owned by the firms elsewhere in the city \\u2014 sometimes breaking in to gain entry.\", \"The problem has caught the attention of Spain\\u2019s national government, led by a left-wing coalition. It has proposed the imposition of rent controls on investment funds and other large landlords, which would cap rent for owners with more than 10 properties in areas where rent increases have outpaced inflation.\", \"Quotable: Miquel Hern\\u00e1ndez, a spokesman for the activist group War Against Cerberus, accused the firms of profiting from the economic distress caused by the pandemic. \\u201cThey\\u2019re treating them like any other asset,\\u201d he said, referring to the homes.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other virus developments:\", \"As the world\\u2019s largest economies shift to cleaner energy, countries rich in cobalt, lithium and other raw materials needed for batteries are suddenly playing the role of oil giants.\", \"Since 2016, China has closed its grip on the global cobalt supply after it acquired major mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, paving the way for the end of major U.S. investment in Congo\\u2019s cobalt and copper mines. China\\u2019s pursuit of the metal has given it an enormous head start in the race to dominate the electrification of the auto industry.\", \"China\\u2019s cobalt mine acquisitions, an investigation by The Times shows, occurred after the U.S. essentially surrendered the resources, failing to safeguard decades of diplomatic and financial investments in Congo. Fifteen of the country\\u2019s 19 cobalt-producing mines are owned or financed by state-backed Chinese companies, some of which are accused of withholding payments and ignoring promises to their Congolese partners.\", \"Background: The American president\\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, was part owner of a firm that helped facilitate a Chinese company\\u2019s purchase of one of the world\\u2019s richest cobalt mines from a U.S. company.\", \"Thirty years ago, the brutal killing of a wealthy socialite became one of France\\u2019s most enduring murder mysteries. The subsequent conviction of her Moroccan gardener, Omar Raddad, above, who has always maintained his innocence, is now in question, thanks to new DNA technology \\u2014 potentially reopening a case that has long unsettled France.\", \"From those first photos of Lady Gaga and Adam Driver in over-the-top apr\\u00e8s-ski looks on set, it was clear the biopic \\u201cHouse of Gucci\\u201d would be a spectacle. Gaga plays Patrizia Reggiani, the former wife of Maurizio Gucci, heir to the luxury brand\\u2019s fortune. In 1998, Reggiani \\u2014 dubbed \\u201cthe Black Widow\\u201d in the Italian press \\u2014 was convicted of plotting Gucci\\u2019s murder.\", \"Before her divorce from Gucci, Reggiani was an eccentric among the Italian jet set \\u2014 she once said, \\u201cI would rather weep in a Rolls-Royce than be happy on a bicycle.\\u201d After Gucci was shot outside his Milan office in 1995, Reggiani told friends and reporters that she had wanted him dead. In her diary, on the day Gucci was killed, there was a single-word entry: \\u201cParadeisos,\\u201d the Greek word for \\u201cparadise.\\u201d\", \"In 1998, The Times called Reggiani\\u2019s trial \\u201cthe ultimate real-life soap opera.\\u201d It combined \\u201csome of the country\\u2019s favorite obsessions: sex, money, designer footwear and astrology.\\u201d (Reggiani\\u2019s personal psychic was among the co-conspirators, admitting that she helped hire the man who shot Gucci at her client\\u2019s instruction.)\", \"Reggiani spent 16 years in prison.
