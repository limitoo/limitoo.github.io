Some 23 couples, many of whom had fled to Denmark to escape wars in Syria and Iraq, were subsequently separated by immigration officials.\", \"\\u201cThey have to be separated,\\u201d she said at the time to the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, \\u201cbecause I will not accept that in my system there could be examples of coercion.\\u201d\", \"One of the couples affected \\u2014 a 17-year-old pregnant woman and a 26-year-old man \\u2014 filed a complaint with the ombudsman of the Danish Parliament, who ruled that the separations were illegal.\", \"The trial is the latest controversy to embroil Ms. Stojberg, who presided over her government\\u2019s immigration policy at a time when rising numbers of migrants from the Mideast and Africa ignited an increase in anti-immigrant sentiment in many European countries.\", \"In 2016, she was criticized for falsely claiming that a public day care center in a Danish town had banned children from eating pork in deference to Muslims.
