A systematic review of global preterm birth published in 2019 showed that the U.S. was in the top ten for preterm births in 2014, ranking seventh, between Pakistan and Ethiopia. Another study found that in part, the \\u201cstresses of racism and income disparity\\u201d may be exacerbating bad outcomes for American moms and babies.\", \"As Sema Sgaier and Jordan Downey point out in a new Times Opinion article about the \\u201cshameful trends\\u201d in U.S. maternal health, mothers who, like Butler, deliver their babies in Alabama, are particularly at risk for preterm birth, along with other major issues. \\u201cOne out of every five women of reproductive age in Southern states,\\u201d they write, \\u201clive in counties with a high risk of death and other poor maternal health outcomes, such as postpartum hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia and preterm birth.\\u201d\", \"This level of needless suffering is enough to make you scream and punch a wall. Why are we like this? For a cathartic and rueful laugh, please read the comedy writer Bess Kalb on how she might have died six weeks after her first child was born if she had not had parental leave. I swear it is very funny despite also being very enraging.\", \"Kalb is currently pregnant with her second child, and has had some complications that may land her on bed rest for the remainder of her pregnancy, \\u201cwhich, as someone who has always longed for the lifestyle of a tragic Victorian heroine, is great news,\\u201d she writes. Though she notes that if she did not have paid leave through her union, she would also be experiencing the stress of worrying about how to afford keeping both herself and her baby alive.\", \"Let\\u2019s close out with two bits of good news. First, as Sheryl Gay Stolberg reported Wednesday, the White House estimated that close to 10 percent of kids ages 5 to 11 had their first vaccine dose already: \\u201cJust 10 days into our program being in full strength, we\\u2019re at 10 percent of kids,\\u201d said Jeff Zients, President Biden\\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator. \\u201cFor perspective,\\u201d Zients added, \\u201cit took about 50 days for us to reach 10 percent of adults with one shot. And when the polio vaccine was first rolled out for kids in the 1950s it took about three months to cross two and a half million shots in arms.\\u201d (And my Opinion colleagues asked three experts how you can stay Covid safe during the winter holidays.)\", \"And second, I\\u2019m over the moon about an event I\\u2019m doing with Michelle Buteau, one of the funniest people around \\u2014 whom you may know from her standup specials or movies such as \\u201cAlways Be My Maybe.\\u201d Our conversation will be on Dec. 8 at 8:30 E.S.T., so hopefully you can put your kids to bed and join us. You can share your Tiny Victories and we will answer your questions.\", \"RSVP here!\", \"Also don\\u2019t miss the incredible essay Buteau wrote for The Times, which included this perfect description of her parenting relationship: \\u201cTo my husband, I\\u2019m not just a helicopter mom. I\\u2019m a drone-on-top-of-a-snowplow mom. To me, my husband is too casual and relaxed. Toddler time is not a Jimmy Buffett concert!\\u201d\", \"If you want a chance to get your Tiny Victory published, find us on Instagram @NYTparenting and use the hashtag #tinyvictories; email us; or enter your Tiny Victory at the bottom of this page.
