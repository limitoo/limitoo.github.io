Territory has recorded two\\u00a0new local cases of COVID-19 overnight, Chief Minister Michael Gunner says.\", \"A returned international traveller has also tested positive.\", \"The two local cases are\\u00a0from Katherine:\\u00a0a 33-year-old woman who is\\u00a0the mother of a student at\\u00a0McFarlane Primary school and\\u00a0has connections to a previous positive case, and a 67-year-old man.\\u00a0\", \"The number of cases in the outbreak now stands at 37.\\u00a0\", \"There are now 423 close contacts, three of which are yet to be located.\", \"The Katherine Centrelink office has been listed as a new close contact exposure site.\", \"Anyone who visited Centrelink between 9:40am and 1:30am on Monday, November 15 must get tested immediately and isolate for 14 days.\", \"Robinson River will move from a lockdown to a lockout, which is expected to end on December 1.\", \"A lockout means fully vaccinated residents will be\\u00a0able to move about the community freely while wearing a mask but they\\u00a0must stay within the Robinson River area, which includes the surrounding homelands.\", \"\\\"Robinson River has shown all Territorians how a lockdown can be done and won in a remote community \\u2014 a\\u00a0highly vaccinated community, a high rate of testing and responding rapidly to an outbreak,\\\" Mr Gunner said.\", \"\\\"The vax rate in Robinson River has clearly made a massive difference.\\\"\", \"No new cases have been recorded in the Binjari and Rockhole communities under hard lockdown.\\u00a0\\\"Critical\\\"\\u00a0tests are due back later today.\", \"Katherine\\u00a0will remain in lockdown for a further 48 hours until 6pm Wednesday as\\u00a0authorities wait for the results of\\u00a01,300 COVID tests conducted\\u00a0in Katherine and surrounding communities, Mr Gunner said.\", \"Authorities have also detected traces of COVID-19 in nearby wastewater catchments.\", \"Four out of the current 37 cases are in hospital.\", \"The condition of a\\u00a065-year-old woman who was previously receiving oxygen has improved.\", \"Acting Chief Health Officer Charles Pain said while he was pleased no new COVID cases were detected in Binjari, \\u201cwe are expecting more\\u201d.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u00a0are in a hard lockdown to protect them,\\u201d he said.\", \"NT Police Commissioner Jamie Chalker said he was disappointed that about eight Binjari residents broke COVID rules by leaving the community yesterday.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Under the cover of darkness, they walked through a back track and ultimately got into the Katherine area,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Six of them were adults and they've now received $5,024 fines.\\\"\", \"About 200 close contacts are in Howard Springs quarantine facility, Dr Pain said, with that number expected to rise in coming days.\", \"Commissioner Walker said police were providing care packages to locked-down communities.\\u00a0\", \"He said an extra 30 NT police officers and about 40 Australian Defence Force personnel were on the ground\\u00a0in Katherine\\u00a0helping people get tested.\", \"Mr Gunner again urged Territorians to get vaccinated, labelling\\u00a0anyone who argued against his government's vaccine mandate for most workers as an \\\"anti-vaxxer\\\".\\u00a0\", \"\\\"If you are anti-mandate, you are absolutely anti-vax,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"If you support anybody who argues against the vaccine, you are an anti-vaxxer.\\\"\", \"Mr Gunner\\u00a0confirmed 400 public servants are set to lose their jobs after the NT's vaccine mandate took effect on November 13.\", \"He said that amounted to a reduction of around 300 positions, which he said would not have an impact on service delivery and would be used as a $30 million budget savings measure.\", \"Mr Gunner said that would allow the government to revise its wages offer to NT public servants, who have criticised a planned four-year wage freeze with $1,000 annual bonuses.\", \"The revised policy put to unions this morning now includes a $4,000 lump sum bonus in the first year and an annual $2,000\\u00a0bonus for the remaining three years.\", \"\\\"If there's a better idea that sticks to the funding envelope, I am all ears,\\\" Mr Gunner\\u00a0said.\", \"\\\"If the unions\\u00a0propose an alternative that's more expensive than this, then the only way to pay for it will be with job cuts, and I'll expect them to include in any proposal, what jobs they\\u00a0think could be cut to pay for it.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"706a10484b3e11ec815e7539275822d3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"706a10484b3e11ec815e7539275822d3"}},
