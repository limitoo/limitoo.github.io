But prestige franchises like these can defy all calculations.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-25T11:07:53.000Z","content":"[\"The Los Angeles Lakers will face the Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday, and from a prestige perspective, it\\u2019s the equivalent of Billy Joel and Elton John touring together.\", \"On court, it\\u2019s a different story, since both teams are having underwhelming seasons. But wins and losses are unlikely to ever significantly matter when it comes to determining the worth of each franchise. They are consistently said to be among the highest-value franchises in the N.B.A., and have been for some time, regardless of how they\\u2019ve performed on the court. The Lakers, of course, have won six championships since 2000 and have had multiple generational talents to attract fans in that span, including Shaquille O\\u2019Neal, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. The Knicks have had the opposite experience \\u2014 rarely winning or putting star players on the court since their N.B.A. finals loss to the San Antonio Spurs in 1999.\", \"Yet, earlier this year, Sportico, a sports business publication, estimated the Knicks and Lakers to be worth more than $5 billion each, two of only three teams, along with the Golden State Warriors, to be worth that much. Last month, Forbes had a similar take, putting the Knicks at $5.8 billion and the Lakers at $5.5. billion. (In 2000, Forbes said the Knicks were the most valuable franchise in the N.B.A. at $390 million. The Lakers were the runner-up at $360 million.)\", \"Franchises have become more lucrative in recent decades as N.B.A. revenues have skyrocketed, and generally, the super rich (on paper) have become richer.\", \"\\u201cThis gets into the next greatest fool theory of team ownership,\\u201d said Rick Burton, a professor of sports management at Syracuse University. \\u201cIt suggests that there will be a next greatest fool willing to pay that amount to get that franchise. And franchise values are essentially the most important job of the league commissioner, which is to drive up the asset appreciation of the franchise holders.\\u201d\", \"Or as Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, put it in an email: \\u201cWhen buyers have cash and are liquid, and business for the league involved is good, prices go up and vice versa.\\u201d\", \"But what does it mean when the Knicks and Lakers are said to be worth more than $5 billion? Here\\u2019s a look behind the curtain. (Representatives for the two franchises did not respond to requests for comment.)\", \"In the most basic terms: It is an estimate of how much a team would sell for if it was on the market. But it is nothing more than an educated guess.\", \"\\u201cAt the end of the day, we\\u2019re estimating what a private enterprise is worth,\\u201d said Kurt Badenhausen, a sports valuations reporter at Sportico. \\u201cNo different than estimating what the value of your house is worth.\\u201d\", \"Much like house valuations on online real estate sites, they are based on several factors, including location, who owns the arena the team plays in, and the team's local television deals. James L. Dolan, the owner of the Knicks, also owns Madison Square Garden, whereas the Lakers lease the space at Staples Center, which will become known as Crypto.com Arena on Christmas Day.\", \"\\u201cIf you have two teams, let\\u2019s say one owns the building and the other leases it, what I\\u2019m valuing is the economics,\\u201d said Mike Ozanian, a managing editor at Forbes who compiles its valuations. \\u201cIn other words, what are the revenues that the team generates at the building versus its expenses?\\u201d\", \"Assets related to the team don\\u2019t necessarily factor in, at least not completely. In the case of the Knicks, while Dolan owns MSG Networks, the regional cable channel that broadcasts games for the Knicks and several other New York-area sports teams, that doesn\\u2019t figure into the valuation of the team. However, the revenue generated from the network does.\", \"Valuators review public information on team finances, consult bankers involved in similar transactions, and consider previous sales and the scarcity of the product.\", \"The franchise worth changes, Cuban said, based purely on \\u201csupply and demand against cost and availability of money versus expected cash flows, if any, and expected appreciation.\\u201d\", \"In 2014, Forbes valued the Los Angeles Clippers at $575 million. Later that year, Steve Ballmer purchased the team for more than $2 billion. Much like when buying a house, sometimes it\\u2019s difficult to account for just how eager a given buyer will be.\", \"\\u201cWe do it with the best information we have based on a team\\u2019s finances, their arena situation and the market that they\\u2019re in,\\u201d Badenhausen said. \\u201cBut sports teams don\\u2019t get bought and sold like traditional businesses, because there is there is an intangible factor in there because while there\\u2019s thousands of businesses you can buy, there\\u2019s only 30 N.B.A. teams that you can buy.\\u201d\", \"Given the rarity of team sales, there aren\\u2019t many data points for comparison.\", \"As Ozanian put it: \\u201cYou could have precise information on a team and at the same time not come close to what the team sells for.\\u201d\", \"Sometimes, the accuracy of a number can be affected by how much information a team is willing to provide.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s possible there are times where, because one team speaks more than another, that the revenue and operating income numbers could be slightly more accurate for one than another,\\u201d Ozanian said. \\u201cBut in terms of the valuations, the enterprise values, I don\\u2019t think that plays a role because the people that I speak to to get my valuations are very much in know, as to the revenues and expenses and therefore very knowledgeable on the valuation.\\u201d\", \"Both franchises generate hundreds of millions of dollars from their local television deals and arenas, which drive revenue through merchandising, sponsorships and ticket sales, though some of that is distributed to other teams through the league\\u2019s revenue sharing system. And location matters, too.\", \"In fact, it might be the most important thing.\", \"\\u201cThey are also located in markets that have tremendous wealth,\\u201d Badenhausen said. \\u201cSo that if they were ever to come up for sale, you would have multiple bidders at multibillion dollar valuations. And the sky is the limit in terms of what somebody would be willing to pay for both these franchises.\\u201d\", \"There\\u2019s also the intangible.\", \"\\u201cYou have one shot to buy the New York Knicks,\\u201d Badenhausen said. \\u201cYou have one shot to buy the Los Angeles Lakers Lakers. They just don\\u2019t come up for sale, right?\\u201d\", \"The Knicks\\u2019 renovation of Madison Square Garden a decade ago also was a big boost.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s one of the oldest buildings in the N.B.A.,\\u201d Badenhausen said. \\u201cBut the renovation turned it into a modern-day cash register.\\u201d\", \"Badenhausen argued that even while the Knicks\\u2019 value has skyrocketed independent of their play, the years of poor performance have lowered the ceiling.\", \"\\u201cThe big market teams are definitely more immune to what happens on the court than small market teams,\\u201d Badenhausen said. \\u201cBut you could make a case that the Knicks would definitely be worth more if they were running out a playoff team every year that was challenging for N.B.A. titles. That 100 percent boosts teams\\u2019 finances, allows them to charge more for tickets, sponsorships and suites and all of those things. And so your revenue goes up and that helps drive valuations high.\\u201d\", \"But the team is still flush, Ozanian said, which is ultimately the biggest arbiter. Television deals are often long-term, and are locked in whether the team is good or bad. Both teams draw well in audience and sponsorships.\", \"\\u201cPotential buyers are not looking at the past,\\u201d Ozanian said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re generally looking at the future, and the amount of incremental revenue that comes in from having a good team versus a not-so-good team generally isn\\u2019t that much more.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"db7c70f84ddf11ec85ef4d7b6f4b4513"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"db7c70f84ddf11ec85ef4d7b6f4b4513"}},
