We all know the worst: the unimpressive secondhand sorcery of formulaic plots, flavorless songs and lifeless animation. But the best \\u2014 well, that\\u2019s the kind of magic that gets passed on for generations.\", \"So it\\u2019s not unlike the magic of Casita, the living house of the Madrigal family in Disney\\u2019s brilliant new animated film \\u201cEncanto.\\u201d Forget Alexa \\u2014 Casita\\u2019s a smart home like no other. She speaks in a language of clapped tiles and flapping window shutters, and helps keep things in order.\", \"And she has her traditions: When each young Madrigal comes of age, she grants them a gift and a door to a new bedroom, an impossibly large and elaborately designed chamber themed around a special ability. It all started years ago, when the Madrigal matriarch, Abuela Alma (Mar\\u00eda Cecilia Botero), and her family fled the violence of their village. After a tragic loss, however, a miracle appeared in the form of a candle that granted the kids their powers. There\\u2019s a shape-shifter, a prophet, a healer and more \\u2014 and then there\\u2019s Mirabel (a perfectly cast Stephanie Beatriz), the muggle of the clan.\", \"When Mirabel finds herself in the middle of a mystery about the future of her family\\u2019s magic, she goes on a mission to figure out how she can stop the worst from happening. It\\u2019s a surprisingly small-scale story: Instead of on a journey, the action unfolds in and around the Madrigal home. But that\\u2019s because \\u201cEncanto\\u201d is most interested in the love and struggles of family, without silly side characters or romantic leads.\", \"The computer animation, some of the best from any major studio in the last several years, presents a dazzling confabulation of hues and a meticulous weaving of precious details \\u2014 like the embroidery on skirts, the golden-brown crust of a cheese arepa and the selection of native Colombian flora.\", \"In \\u201cEncanto\\u201d there\\u2019s a robust engagement with, and respect for, Latino culture in all of its dimensions. The Madrigal family members\\u2019 skin tones range from lighter to darker, their hair textures from straight to kinky-curly. And the grand pooh-bah of the contemporary musical movie score, Lin-Manuel Miranda, provides a spellbinding soundtrack of songs combining salsa, bachata and hip-hop played with traditional folk instruments from Colombia.\", \"The directors, Jared Bush and Byron Howard, last collaborated on another of Disney\\u2019s brightest gems of the last decade, the racially aware \\u201cZootopia,\\u201d and they subtly incorporate an important political message into this film as well. This is a story about displaced people who build a home from nothing. Their history is the source of their magic, and they use that magic to selflessly improve their community, without needing to assimilate into it. Given our nation\\u2019s track record on these subjects, to see such a tale in a children\\u2019s movie is quietly extraordinary.\", \"But \\u201cEncanto\\u201d also resists having its magical characters fall into the trope of the model immigrants \\u2014 that they have only earned their place because of their special abilities. The Madrigal family members belong even when they\\u2019re not conjuring roses or transforming the weather. And even with these fantastic feats of wizardry, the Madrigals, with all of their relatable family dynamics, are believably loving, funny and flawed.\", \"If home is where the heart is, my heart\\u2019s with Casita.\"]","href_hash":"205811f44c9211ecbc5bf95ba6828a50"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"205811f44c9211ecbc5bf95ba6828a50"}},
