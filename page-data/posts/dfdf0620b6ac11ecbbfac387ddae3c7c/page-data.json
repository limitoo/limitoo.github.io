His office has repeatedly insisted the investigation, which led to charges being filed last July against the Trump Organization and its CFO, is ongoing.\", \"\\\"In the long and proud tradition of white-collar prosecutions at the Manhattan D.A.'s Office, we are investigating thoroughly and following the facts without fear or favor,\\\" Bragg said Thursday.\", \"The Trump Organization and its CFO, Allen Weisselberg, in February asked a judge to dismiss the criminal case against them.
