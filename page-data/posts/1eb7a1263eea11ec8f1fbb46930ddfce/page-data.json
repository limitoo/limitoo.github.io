New Yorkâ€™s 26.2 miles could be her toughest challenge yet.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-06T10:28:50.000Z","content":"[\"Molly Seidel and Jon Green hashed out their grand plan over several cups of coffee.\", \"Not long after she left her Boston-based training group in late 2019, Seidel heard from Green, a friend and former training partner, who wanted to know if she needed help planning her workouts. As someone who was trying to keep his own professional running career alive, Green was familiar with the challenges of striking out on your own.\", \"So they met one afternoon at a coffee shop, where Green spent nearly three hours asking Seidel about her goals and studying her training logs. He wanted to know the types of workouts she enjoyed and the types of workouts that bothered her. She was coming off a long series of injuries, and Green knew they would need to address those problems, too.\", \"\\u201cBasically,\\u201d Green said, \\u201cwe talked about everything you could think of.\\u201d\", \"Two years later, Seidel, 27, is an Olympic bronze medalist and a crowd favorite in Sunday\\u2019s New York City Marathon. One of American distance running\\u2019s most captivating and candid personalities, Seidel consistently cites Green \\u2014 now 26 and considered something of a coaching wunderkind \\u2014 as a major factor in her success.\", \"\\u201cJon Green,\\u201d Seidel said, \\u201cis the reason I have a marathoning career.\\u201d\", \"Since her surprise podium finish at the Tokyo Games in August, Seidel has had a whirlwind three months while trying to balance her preparation for New York. Green has settled into his new role as the head coach of Atalanta NYC, a women\\u2019s running team based in New York, while he continues to work with Seidel, who largely trains alone as a Puma-sponsored athlete.\", \"\\u201cYou have to look at how we work together as a partnership,\\u201d Seidel said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been able to support each other as we\\u2019ve grown from figuring this whole thing out.\\u201d\", \"Seidel and Green knew of each other as college athletes \\u2014 Green was a Big East Conference champion at Georgetown, while Seidel was one of the country\\u2019s most decorated runners at Notre Dame \\u2014 before they became close friends as teammates for the Freedom Track Club in Boston. They both left the team in 2019.\", \"\\u201cIt just wasn\\u2019t the greatest fit,\\u201d Green said.\", \"As they began to work together, one of the first things that Green did was eliminate the speedier workouts that had led to injuries for Seidel. The idea, Green said, was to avoid any training that was faster than 5-kilometer race pace. High volume, though, had never been an issue for her, and that was their primary focus ahead of the U.S. Olympic marathon trials in February 2020.\", \"\\u201cWhere she excels is doing easy mileage,\\u201d Green said, \\u201cand a lot of easy mileage. Like, 100-plus miles a week comes really easy and natural to her.\\u201d\", \"Yet Green also encouraged Seidel to be honest with him about her aches and pains. She is almost too tough for her own good, he said.\", \"\\u201cMolly will not tell me something is hurting unless it\\u2019s getting to the point where she feels I need to know,\\u201d Green said. \\u201cHer \\u20183\\u2019 on the pain scale is like a \\u20189\\u2019 for everybody else.\\u201d\", \"They both tempered their expectations for the marathon trials, and for good reason: Seidel had never run a marathon. The more realistic aim, at least at the time, was for her to use her marathon training as a base of aerobic fitness ahead of the U.S. Olympic track and field trials later that summer. \\u201cOur end goal was to set up for the 10,000 meters,\\u201d Green said.\", \"The marathon trials were staged in Atlanta, where Green wanted to be sure that he could follow Seidel\\u2019s progress on the course. So he hopped on Craigslist, identified people in the area who were selling used bicycles and asked if they would be willing to rent theirs to him for the day. Green got a lot of \\u201cnopes,\\u201d he said, before he found one slightly less skeptical gentleman.\", \"\\u201cHe wanted to know how he would get his bike back,\\u201d Green said, \\u201cso I wrote up a mini contract and sent him a photo of my license.\\u201d\", \"It turned out to be one of the best $30 investments ever: Seidel surged to a second-place finish to secure one of three spots on the U.S. team.\", \"In the wake of Seidel\\u2019s triumph in Atlanta, neither she nor Green boarded a rocket ship to fame and fortune. The onset of the pandemic delayed the Olympics by a year. Seidel, who before the trials made ends meet as a babysitter and a barista, added another job to her r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9: working for Instacart. Green, meanwhile, had decided to retire from pro running to pursue a full-time coaching job, but his timing was terrible: No one was hiring. So he helped out at his parents\\u2019 hardware store outside Boston.\", \"\\u201cSo much hand sanitizer,\\u201d he said.\", \"As the Olympics came into clearer focus, Green was unsure whether he would be able to watch Seidel race in person because of pandemic protocols. Thanks to some ingenuity and luck, Green found his way to the marathon course in Sapporo, Japan, about 500 miles north of Tokyo, just in time to blow through his cellphone\\u2019s data plan as he tracked Seidel\\u2019s splits.\", \"Green had positioned himself at a bottle station, and as she made her final loop of the circuit, he shouted \\u201cRule 5!\\u201d at her, which was essentially code for: Toughen up! Its origin was from a cycling book that Seidel had read, and it was something that resonated with her through all her training and all her comebacks.\", \"In fearsomely hot conditions, Seidel became the first American woman to win a medal in an Olympic marathon since 2004. Green said he was still not sure whether Seidel had grasped the significance of her achievement. \\u201cAnd maybe she never will,\\u201d he said.\", \"In recent weeks, Seidel has alluded to some of the mental and physical challenges of her profession. But she often thinks back to the old days, when she was serving coffee and her coach was working at a hardware store, and she tries to process it all.\", \"\\u201cThe whole decision to do a marathon was between the two of us,\\u201d Seidel said, \\u201cand it\\u2019s been so fun to see how this has progressed.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"1eb7a1263eea11ec8f1fbb46930ddfce"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1eb7a1263eea11ec8f1fbb46930ddfce"}},
