He was a player development coach with the N.B.A.\\u2019s Denver Nuggets when Carmelo Anthony was there. He was an assistant coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers during the four long years after LeBron James left for Miami. Dirk Nowitzki\\u2019s final years with the Mavericks and the rise of Luka Doncic? Mosley was there, too, as an assistant in Dallas.\", \"He spent 16 seasons on N.B.A. coaching staffs, developing his skills and hoping for his big break to be a head coach. He had heeded his mother\\u2019s advice about playing college basketball for a Black coach, to learn leadership skills from someone who looked like him. The doubts about his ever getting that kind of job only surfaced in recent years when he interviewed for \\u2014 and was turned down for \\u2014 seven N.B.A. head coaching jobs.\", \"\\u201cBecause you knew you were qualified,\\u201d Mosley said. \\u201cYou knew you had interviewed well. You knew that you had the ability to do it.\\u201d\", \"The N.B.A.\\u2019s coaching and executive ranks have long been dominated by white men, even though more than 70 percent of players are Black. But this year, Mosley became part of an unusual off-season, in which seven of eight head coaching vacancies were filled by Black candidates. Five of them, including Mosley, who was hired by the Orlando Magic in July, are first-time head coaches. The others are Wes Unseld Jr. of the Washington Wizards, Willie Green of the New Orleans Pelicans, Ime Udoka of the Boston Celtics and Chauncey Billups of the Portland Trail Blazers. Jason Kidd of the Dallas Mavericks and Nate McMillan of the Atlanta Hawks had been head coaches elsewhere before.\", \"\\u201cIf this was 15 years ago, we probably don\\u2019t get these positions,\\u201d Green said.\", \"The uptick \\u2014 13 of the league\\u2019s 30 coaches are now Black and two others are not white \\u2014 came during a broader national conversation about race and hiring practices. Black players harnessed their voices to seek change that they felt was overdue.\", \"\\u201cThis is a stain on the league that no one can deny,\\u201d Michele Roberts, the executive director of the players\\u2019 union, said in an interview, \\u201cand we\\u2019ve got to continue to do better.\\u201d\", \"Long before he became the coach of the Celtics, Udoka was a self-described student of the game. As a teenager in Portland, Ore., he would record games that featured some of his favorite college players, standouts like Syracuse\\u2019s Lawrence Moten and Lamond Murray of the University of California, Berkeley. Then he would head to the playground to mimic their moves. (Udoka still has a stack of VHS tapes at home.)\", \"\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t the most athletic or skilled guy,\\u201d Udoka said, \\u201cso I really had to use my brain for an advantage. I always thought through the game a certain way, and I think some coaches saw that in me, too.\\u201d\", \"Udoka grew up in a predominantly Black neighborhood, went to a Black high school and had Black coaches. He was not especially conscious of race, he said, since being in that environment was all he knew. But his high school coach \\u201cpreached family and togetherness and a brotherhood,\\u201d Udoka said, and he carried those lessons with him.\", \"Udoka was bouncing around the N.B.A. as a defense-minded forward when he got what he described as \\u201cthe coaching bug.\\u201d He helped found an Amateur Athletic Union team in Portland that included Terrence Ross and Terrence Jones, future N.B.A. players. Udoka also participated in coaching clinics hosted by the N.B.A. players\\u2019 union. After retiring, he joined the San Antonio Spurs in 2012 as an assistant under Gregg Popovich.\", \"The Celtics job opened in June when the team announced that Brad Stevens, who had coached the team for eight seasons, would be its new president of basketball operations. Jaylen Brown, one of the Celtics\\u2019 young stars, said in a recent interview with The Undefeated that he had told the team to hire a Black candidate. Representation was important to him, he said.\", \"\\u201cPlayers were asking and demanding and wanting to see more guys who looked like them,\\u201d Udoka said. He added: \\u201cIn coaching, I think there\\u2019s been a shift from Xs and Os and game plans to the value that\\u2019s placed on relationships. And there\\u2019s a natural cultural bond that Black coaches are going to have with their players.\\u201d\", \"Udoka said he was not suggesting that white coaches couldn\\u2019t bond with Black players. He cited Popovich, who is white, as someone who has long stressed the importance of relationships. But for a new coach on a new team, it would be na\\u00efve to believe that race was not a factor.\", \"\\u201cBasketball is mainly minority-based,\\u201d Celtics point guard Marcus Smart said in an interview. \\u201cSo having a minority as a coach, I can connect with him. I can say things to him, or he can say things to me, and we get it. Whereas it\\u2019s different when you don\\u2019t. You have to try to figure out, OK, how can I meet them halfway?\\u201d\", \"Still, a coach is a coach: Udoka suspended Smart for the team\\u2019s preseason finale for breaking an unspecified team rule.\", \"About three years ago, Rick Carlisle, as president of the National Basketball Coaches Association, was hearing from an increasing number of young assistants of diverse backgrounds who felt they were not getting a fair shake at head coaching jobs.\", \"The league and the coaches\\u2019 association soon began the N.B.A. Coaches Equality Initiative, a program aimed at developing young coaches and ensuring that qualified candidates are visible when jobs arise. Since 2019, there have been numerous workshops, summits, panel discussions and networking opportunities.\", \"And there is an app, a coaches database that was unveiled last year. It now includes profiles of about 300 coaches, whom the league\\u2019s power brokers \\u2014 owners, general managers, team presidents \\u2014 can access, Carlisle said. Coaches can upload their histories, their philosophies and even their interview clips. Think of it is as Bumble for the N.B.A. coaching set. But it is all part of a larger mission, said Oris Stuart, the chief people and inclusion officer for the league.\", \"\\u201cWe have ongoing conversations with our teams about the importance of making sure that, as they\\u2019re making decisions, the process is inclusive,\\u201d Stuart said in an interview. \\u201cWe focus on the importance of making sure that the best talent is considered, that we make a wide reach and that we go beyond the pre-established networks that people are working from.\\u201d\", \"But within the past year, the hiring processes for two white coaches \\u2014 including the one that landed Carlisle with the Indiana Pacers \\u2014 have been criticized for not appearing to be inclusive.\", \"The Minnesota Timberwolves fired Ryan Saunders as their coach in February and announced his replacement, Chris Finch, who is white, on the same day. The Timberwolves chose not to promote the team\\u2019s associate head coach, David Vanterpool, who is Black, which would have been typical after a midseason firing. (Vanterpool is now an assistant for the Nets.)\", \"The perception was that there was no way the Timberwolves could have seriously considered any Black candidates given their accelerated timeline, said Roberts, the executive director of the players\\u2019 union. The timing of the change, she added, \\u201cgot under a lot of people\\u2019s skin.\\u201d\", \"Within days, Carlisle and David Fogel, the executive director of the coaches\\u2019 association, released a statement in which the organization expressed its \\u201cdisappointment\\u201d with Minnesota\\u2019s search, saying that it is \\u201cour responsibility to point out when an organization fails to conduct a thorough and transparent search of candidates from a wide range of diverse backgrounds.\\u201d\", \"But just a few months later, in June, Carlisle accepted the Pacers job after what appeared to be an abbreviated search. Indiana had fired Nate Bjorkgren earlier in the month after just one season, and they had interviewed only one other candidate when they offered Carlisle the job. Chad Buchanan, Indiana\\u2019s general manager, said in an interview that the team wanted an experienced coach and that Carlisle had unexpectedly become available after he resigned from the Dallas Mavericks, which he had coached for 13 seasons and led to a championship in 2011.\", \"Buchanan sought to assure Carlisle by telling him that the Pacers had interviewed 17 candidates, of whom eight were Black and one was female, before hiring Bjorkgren eight months earlier.\", \"\\u201cThis was something I was concerned about,\\u201d Carlisle said, \\u201cbut when they gave me that information, I was comfortable moving forward.\\u201d\", \"As an economics major at Johns Hopkins University, Wes Unseld Jr. thought he would get into investment banking. But for two summers, before and after graduating in 1997, he interned for the Wizards. His father, also Wes, who was synonymous with the franchise from his Hall of Fame playing days, had moved into the front office as the team\\u2019s general manager after seven seasons as its head coach. The elder Unseld invited his son to learn the ropes, just in case the financial world was not for him.\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re going to be in this business, you\\u2019ve got to learn the business,\\u201d Wes Unseld Jr. recalled his father telling him. \\u201cSo I\\u2019m thinking, OK, I\\u2019ll be around basketball. \\u2018No, you\\u2019re going to intern in every department.\\u2019 Community relations, public relations, marketing, sales \\u2014 you name it, I did it.\\u201d\", \"Unseld, who was a very good Division III player for Johns Hopkins, soon realized that he could not leave the game behind, and he became one of the many unsung, behind-the-scenes fixtures in the N.B.A. After eight seasons as a scout for Washington, he spent the next 16 as an assistant for various teams around the league. He refined offenses. He built defenses. With the Wizards, he was known as The Genius for his attention to detail and his instinctive feel for the game. In Denver, he helped shape Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray into stars.\", \"Yet Unseld could not land a head coaching job. He said he was never sure if his race was a factor. \\u201cWhen an opportunity doesn\\u2019t pan out, sometimes it\\u2019s easy to ask, \\u2018Was it that?\\u2019\\u201d Unseld said. \\u201cAnd it may have been. It\\u2019s difficult to tell.\\u201d\", \"After a record 14 Black coaches were manning benches for teams at the start of the 2012-13 season, those numbers dipped in subsequent years, showing how tenuous progress can be. Unseld said the N.B.A. is \\u201ca network business like any other business.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re not connected to the decision makers, it can be difficult,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s an overt way of not interviewing or not giving people of color a chance, but maybe they just don\\u2019t have that network to pull from. It\\u2019s more of a systemic issue.\\u201d\", \"Roberts commended the coaches\\u2019 association for working to address that issue in recent seasons. But the real power, she said, has come from the players themselves.\", \"\\u201cA happy team is probably a more successful team,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd if the players think management is thumbing its nose at their articulated concerns about a coaching staff, then what\\u2019s their motivation to stay?\\u201d\", \"In New Orleans, Willie Green often thinks of his uncle, Gary Green, who coached him when he was growing up in Detroit, and who imbued him with the fundamentals. After several years as an assistant with Golden State and Phoenix, Green said he felt a heightened sense of responsibility.\", \"\\u201cWe have to be caretakers of these opportunities,\\u201d he said.\", \"In Boston, Garrett Jackson, a former player on Udoka\\u2019s A.A.U. team, is now one of Udoka\\u2019s video coordinators. And Mosley got his first win for the Magic with a narrow victory against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. He was gifted the game ball, then got back to business.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s like anything,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou just put your head down and do the work.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e0677b123c7311ecb0d2000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e0677b123c7311ecb0d2000017025a03"}},
