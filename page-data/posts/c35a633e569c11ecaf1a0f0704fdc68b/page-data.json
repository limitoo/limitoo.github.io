That\\u2019s less than the $1.7 billion the digital media group was reportedly worth when NBCUniversal invested in it a few years ago.\", \"But the deal makes BuzzFeed a public company, which many of its smaller competitors have been unable to achieve. BuzzFeed\\u2019s reception on the stock market will serve as a test for others, like Vice and Vox, that have considered a similar path.\", \"The SPAC market has \\u201cflipped\\u201d since BuzzFeed first pursued its deal, BuzzFeed\\u2019s chief executive, Jonah Peretti, told the DealBook newsletter. SPAC deals took off last summer, amid high valuations that attracted digital media companies (among many others). But as SPACs have fallen out of favor, many investors have asked for their money back before mergers, a feature of the financial vehicles that go public on the promise of identifying an acquisition target at a later date.\", \"Rising investor redemptions have left SPACs\\u2019 merger partners with less money than anticipated. BuzzFeed, which ended up with $16 million from the SPAC merger instead of more than $250 million that was raised by the vehicle before the deal, structured the transaction with that shift in mind, Mr. Peretti said, including a $150 million convertible bond.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t care how we go public,\\u201d Mr. Peretti said. \\u201cOnce we saw that we had our path through that market \\u2014 even though the market was cold \\u2014 it was just a means to an end to get public.\\u201d As a listed company, BuzzFeed plans to buy competitors in an industry where scale is crucial. As part of the SPAC deal, BuzzFeed announced an acquisition of the sports and entertainment publisher Complex, adding to its purchase of Huffington Post last November.\", \"E-commerce is a key part of BuzzFeed\\u2019s growth plan. With many of its competitors putting content behind subscription paywalls, Mr. Peretti said there was an opportunity to \\u201cbe the place where you can reach the broad public.\\u201d He sees other chances to accelerate BuzzFeed\\u2019s growth, like its shopping site that sells products directly to consumers, including via streaming video shows.\"]","href_hash":"c35a633e569c11ecaf1a0f0704fdc68b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c35a633e569c11ecaf1a0f0704fdc68b"}},
