Her eyes were wide and unblinking, her mind murky from the toxins of liver disease and low blood pressure.\", \"She was not a candidate for a liver transplant, the specialist explained, at least not now. He paused to give my patient and her husband time to absorb the decision. She pulled the hospital blanket up to her chin. Her husband simply nodded. Their daughter would later tell me that her father got \\u201cthe gist\\u201d of the conversation, even if he could not understand the details. When we asked if he had questions, he shook his head. No.\", \"After all, what could he say? My patient had stopped drinking only four months earlier, after decades of alcohol use, and most transplant centers look for six months of sobriety in cases like hers. Her medical record told a story of forgotten medications and missed appointments, and as a result, she carried with her the long shadow of \\u201cnoncompliance.\\u201d And though she had loving family members, it was not clear that they could offer the necessary at-home care to ensure her a successful recovery after transplant.\", \"My patient was not a \\u201cgood\\u201d candidate for a new liver. As a critical-care doctor, I\\u2019ve received this news alongside a patient before. Though my first instinct is often to rail against these realities, I have learned to recognize that transplant teams are doing the impossible work of balancing stewardship of a limited resource with their desire to care for the individual in front of them.\", \"A transplant program is also beholden to its metrics. If the one-year survival of transplant recipients is lower than expected or if transplant failure is higher than expected, a program could be put on probation or lose its certification entirely. For smaller or newer programs, one or two unsuccessful transplants could have an outsize impact on these overall numbers. This narrow focus on one-year outcomes can leave centers afraid to take a chance on a patient who might be perceived as a more borderline candidate.\", \"But in the days that followed my patient\\u2019s assessment, as I worried about how long she would live without a new liver, I began to reflect on the fact that evaluation for transplant is one of the few areas of medicine where a person can be declined a lifesaving intervention based on subjective criteria \\u2014 a medical team\\u2019s impression of how likely the patient is to start drinking again or reliably take medication. In any given case these considerations may make sense, but they can bring our biases into play: Studies show that in the United States, Black and Hispanic and low-income patients are less likely to receive organ transplants than similarly situated white and higher-income patients.\", \"\\u201cIn our minds, the norm or \\u2018ideal\\u2019 transplant patient is the well-supported, well-spoken, self-advocating, \\u2018adherent\\u2019 patient,\\u201d said Dr. Martha Pavlakis, the medical director of kidney and pancreas transplantation at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. \\u201cHow often do we admit it\\u2019s the \\u2018high-socioeconomic-status white patient\\u2019 that is seen as the norm that nonwhite patients are judged against?\\u201d\", \"What makes someone a \\u201cgood\\u201d transplant candidate? Maybe it is inevitable that doctors\\u2019 biases creep in when we must make fraught decisions about a scarce resource. The medical community has dealt with many similar issues before, and not always well. Back in the 1960s, when dialysis machines were limited in number, a Seattle committee of physicians, nurses and community members was charged with developing an allocation system. This so-called God Committee decided that social worth \\u2014 an assessment of a person\\u2019s contribution to society \\u2014 would help determine who would receive the lifesaving treatment. When I was in medical school, this history was shared as a cautionary tale. And yet now, years later, I find myself wondering how far we\\u2019ve really come.\", \"Early in my medical training, I crowded into a small conference room to observe members of a multidisciplinary transplant committee decide which of their patients would be listed for new lungs. As they discussed each person, the surgeons and medical doctors raised their concerns: One patient had heart disease so severe that the patient\\u2019s body might not tolerate the transplant; another had a body weight above the cutoff. The goal was to identify people who were sick enough to benefit but not so sick or medically complex that a transplant might do them harm.\", \"But these were not the only factors that mattered. Psychosocial considerations, such as whether a patient lacked strong support at home or had a record of missed appointments, were viewed as equally important. And in contrast to the evidence underpinning the medical criteria, these metrics were more subjective, influenced by what Dr. Pavlakis described to me as \\u201cgestalt and some anecdotes.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Keren Ladin, an associate professor at Tufts University, spent years sitting in on transplant meetings like this one to better understand the impact of nonmedical criteria on who gets listed. To deconstruct the process, Dr. Ladin, who is also the chair of the United Network on Organ Sharing Ethics Committee, coded the language used to make these decisions and communicate them to patients. She focused in particular on the requirement for social support, which she believes is \\u201ca bigger part of inequities in access to transplant than people think.\\u201d\", \"Social-support requirements vary based on the intensity of the surgery and the length of the required rehabilitation. But in general, a patient is expected to have one to three people who can commit to helping in recovery \\u2014 driving to appointments, managing medications or responding to overnight emergencies. In a health care system that does not guarantee these sorts of services for patients, the responsibility falls to family and friends. As a result, lower-income patients may be less likely to meet the requirements for robust social support because their loved ones often can\\u2019t afford to leave their jobs or they already care for other family members. This difficult reality can disqualify someone from receiving an organ, even though there is only tenuous evidence that social support \\u2014 as transplant programs define it \\u2014 is necessary for success after transplant.\", \"Of course, most patients will need help after transplant. But Dr. Ladin pointed me to an analysis of existing studies that found only a weak and inconsistent relationship between social support and medication adherence or survival after transplant. Marital status, for example, was not significantly associated with transplant success. Nevertheless, a nationwide survey of more than 500 transplant providers estimated that nearly one in 10 candidates for transplant were deemed ineligible because of inadequate social support. A majority of the providers surveyed said they felt that the support criteria disproportionately affected patients with lower socioeconomic status.\", \"Transplant committees\\u2019 subjective sense of who is \\u201clikable\\u201d can also affect whom the team is willing to advocate and whom they are not. Dr. Dinee Simpson, a transplant surgeon at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, recalled a troubling example from a committee meeting early in her surgical training. A Black man whose personality had \\u201cclashed with many providers\\u201d was being evaluated for kidney transplant. By all objective measures, she remembered, the patient seemed to be a good candidate. Then someone mentioned that he had a long fingernail on his little finger, which the person believed was an indication of cocaine use. The team ultimately decided not to list the man for a transplant. \\u201cI cannot believe I witnessed that,\\u201d Dr. Simpson recalled thinking. \\u201cSomething needs to change.\\u201d\", \"Now, decades later, Dr. Simpson is making that change, as the first Black female transplant surgeon in Illinois, where she founded and directs the African American Transplant Access Program at Northwestern University. In developing the program, Dr. Simpson worked to counter the distrust of the medical system that is prevalent in the Black community: Since studies show that racial concordance between patients and clinicians can improve trust and communication, she meets with all patients herself, giving them time to tell their stories and explaining the transplant process without using medical jargon. She has also hired a Black social worker and a health literacy coach. When it comes to the evaluation, the team brings a diversity of voices and viewpoints to the transplant committee that\\u2019s lacking at many institutions. As a result, in the two years since the program started, Dr. Simpson said, the number of Black patients listed for kidney transplant at the center has increased by 18 percent.\", \"This fall, Dr. Simpson performed a kidney transplant on a 45-year-old woman who had been declined for transplant at two other medical centers. The patient\\u2019s kidneys failed 13 years before, during pregnancy, leaving her tethered to dialysis. A single mother, she often had to choose between dialysis sessions and parental responsibilities \\u2014 taking her children to their own doctor appointments and attending parent-teacher conferences. As a result of those kinds of needs, she skipped dialysis from time to time, a decision that earned her a label of \\u201cnoncompliant.\\u201d\", \"But when members of Dr. Simpson\\u2019s team investigated, they learned that each time the woman had missed a dialysis session, she had called ahead to say she wouldn\\u2019t make it and most of the time she had rescheduled, a small act that spoke volumes: She was as responsible as she could be within the constraints of her reality. Dr. Simpson included that information when presenting the patient to the transplant committee. They decided to list her.\", \"Acknowledging that the traditional notion of support is a luxury that should not necessarily determine access to a lifesaving transplant, Dr. Simpson\\u2019s team tries to find creative solutions for patients and encourage transplant committees to be flexible in their definitions of support. A woman awaiting a kidney transplant was ultimately listed after the team cobbled together a patchwork of support, calling on community resources like her church. \\u201cYou have to think outside the box,\\u201d Dr. Simpson said. \\u201cBut that takes extra work. It takes effort.\\u201d\", \"That effort is not possible without social work, which is itself a limited resource. The program\\u2019s social worker, Shimere Harrington, spends time asking questions to understand why patients missed appointments, why they left another hospital against medical advice, why their life circumstances might affect the way they present themselves \\u2014 potentially coming off as \\u201cunlikable.\\u201d By digging deeper into patients\\u2019 circumstances, she said, she can provide a more nuanced narrative for the transplant committee and build the trust with patients that will be necessary for success after their surgeries.\", \"So much of transplant decision-making is about narrative, which is one reason misconceptions can take hold when patients do not speak English as their primary language. Hispanic patients are about half as likely as their white peers to receive kidney donations from family or friends \\u2014 a gap that Dr. Juan Carlos Caicedo, an adult and pediatric transplant surgeon who directs the Hispanic Transplant Program at Northwestern Medicine, is working to close. \\u201cPeople will argue that these are not good patients because they don\\u2019t follow recommendations, but they are dead wrong,\\u201d he told me. \\u201cThey are great patients, as long as they understand you.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Caicedo, who was born and raised in Colombia, encourages his patients to bring their entire family, including grandparents, to their medical appointments. To build trust, he takes on roles that would otherwise be delegated to a nurse or a social worker, like offering the introductory explanation of the transplant process himself. One 2015 study of Dr. Caicedo\\u2019s program found that since it began in 2006, the number of Hispanic patients who are added to the kidney transplant wait list at his center has increased by more than 90 percent and the number of Hispanics receiving kidneys from donors like family members or friends has gone up by nearly 75 percent. His team has distilled this work into a protocol that is now being tested at other transplant centers around the country.\", \"Change is happening. At my hospital, our lung transplant team is working to identify recipients from underserved communities who can become \\u201cambassadors\\u201d to educate others and build trust. Other centers are considering creative solutions, like volunteer programs to offer social support for patients who do not have their own. There\\u2019s also a push to rigorously track people who are disqualified from transplant to increase transparency around how nonmedical criteria affect various demographic groups. Perhaps most important, transplant teams are openly discussing and challenging their assumptions about who makes a \\u201cgood\\u201d transplant candidate. And in doing so, more lives may be saved.\"]","href_hash":"0b79c6574d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0b79c6574d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}},
