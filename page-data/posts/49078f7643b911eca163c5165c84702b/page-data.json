After Andy Warhol died in 1987, some 10,000 items, from 175 cookie jars to a 1974 Rolls-Royce, were auctioned off. Following the modernist painter Florine Stettheimer\\u2019s death in 1944, her paintings, which were never sold during her lifetime, were donated to museums across the United States.\", \"When the key land art figure Nancy Holt died at 75 of leukemia in 2014, her will called for the creation of an organization to guide twin legacies \\u2014 hers and that of her artist husband, Robert Smithson, who died in a 1973 plane crash at age 35. Holt\\u2019s estate included her magnum opus, a quartet of cosmically aligned concrete cylinders in Utah\\u2019s Great Basin Desert known as \\u201cSun Tunnels\\u201d (1973-76), which was acquired by the New York-based Dia Art Foundation, as well as a surprise. \\u201cWe discovered that we owned an island,\\u201d says the writer and curator Lisa Le Feuvre, who was hired as the Holt/Smithson Foundation\\u2019s director.\", \"Little Fort Island \\u2014 or Guard Island, as it is also known \\u2014 is a thin sliver of rock off the craggy coast of Maine, near the small town of Harrington (population 950), between Bangor and the Canadian border. It\\u2019s a few hundred feet long, with a small grouping of trees at its center. Holt and Smithson had bought it, sight unseen, for $3,000 in 1971, the year after he completed \\u201cSpiral Jetty,\\u201d his swirl of basalt stones that extends some 1,600 feet into Utah\\u2019s Great Salt Lake. Smithson made drawings for an earthwork there that would include a curving canal and land bridge, but after he actually visited the island, he changed his mind.\", \"\\u201cHe decided that it was too picturesque,\\u201d Le Feuvre says from her office in Santa Fe, N.M., where Holt once had a home. \\u201cI read that, and I never understood what he meant by that.\\u201d However, when she traveled there earlier this year, removing her shoes and trudging through knee-deep mud at low tide to reach the spot where Smithson had thought he might site the project, \\u201cI got it,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt is so beautiful.\\u201d\", \"THE ISLAND HAS now become a central, and characteristically idiosyncratic, component of the Holt/Smithson Foundation\\u2019s efforts to posthumously expand and extend the work of its eponyms. \\u201cHow do you build creative legacies of artists?\\u201d Le Feuvre asks. \\u201cYou do it through scholarship, through research, but the way that you really do it is by keeping the spirits of the artists alive.\\u201d The foundation has approached five revered artists of different ages and practices \\u2014 the multimedia artist Ren\\u00e9e Green; the filmmaker and draftsperson Tacita Dean; the visual and performance artist Joan Jonas; Oscar Santill\\u00e1n, whose work explores the gap between science and ecosystems; and Sky Hopinka, who looks at identity and the natural world through many mediums \\u2014 with a remarkably open-ended proposal: that they spend a couple of years learning and thinking about the island and in response propose any kind of work they can dream of, on the island or off, to be realized in some form or merely imagined.\", \"The five artists were selected in part because \\u201cthey\\u2019re all supercritical, and difficult, and love making knots rather than undoing them,\\u201d Le Feuvre explains; interviewed late this past summer, they were planning their trips and shaping their concepts. For Santill\\u00e1n, Holt and Smithson are responsible for \\u201cchanging the notion of artists representing nature to artists participating within ecologies.\\u201d The Ecuador-born artist makes works that form links between distances, times and materials. He has affixed buttons carved from a meteorite to a shirt he found in a rainforest and sewed an ethereal hanging weaving from the yarns of 10 existing textiles, one from each of the 10 centuries of the past millennium.\", \"While he describes himself as a \\u201cslow thinker\\u201d in an interview from the Netherlands, where he lives when not in Ecuador, Santill\\u00e1n, 41, says he is \\u201ctrying to bring together three different histories\\u201d in conversation with Little Fort Island: obscure 1960s biological-computing experiments, the study of plant intelligence and the Indigenous South American Quechua people\\u2019s concept that certain places are endowed with, as he puts it, \\u201csome kind of cognitive capabilities of [their] own.\\u201d (The anthropologist Marisol de la Cadena coined the English term Earth Being, a translation of the Quechua tirakuna, for such forms.) It\\u2019s all part of his \\u201congoing search for other ways of scientific knowledge that don\\u2019t fit into the Western grid,\\u201d he says.\", \"Dean, 56, and Green, 62, have actually made works in the past that reference Smithson, and Jonas, 85, knew the couple. Yet the island project is part of the foundation\\u2019s commitment to not be \\u201cpickling in vinegar Holt\\u2019s and Smithson\\u2019s work as it was in 1972,\\u201d as Le Feuvre says, \\u201cbecause, as we all know, that\\u2019s not how art works. It lives and breathes.\\u201d Earthworks change; their meaning does, too.\", \"\\u201cWe know that some of Smithson\\u2019s and Holt\\u2019s work is problematic,\\u201d Le Feuvre says, noting that an artist today would not dump a giant barrel of industrial glue outside the campus of the University of British Columbia, as Smithson did for his 1970 \\u201cGlue Pour.\\u201d (\\u201cDo not dump refuse,\\u201d read a nearby sign.) \\u201cSpiral Jetty,\\u201d Smithson\\u2019s most famous work by far, and one of the most recognizable pieces of art of the 20th century, has endured challenges of its own: Originally submerged for long periods in the Great Salt Lake, it is now fully visible thanks to decades of droughts; this has increased its popularity but also threatened its longevity as more people interact with it. (The possibility of oil drilling nearby poses a different kind of threat.)\", \"The openness of the foundation\\u2019s invitation appealed to Hopinka, 37, who describes the \\u201cconcerns or questions I\\u2019ve had about Smithson and Holt being white artists on Indigenous lands, making work that is permanent.\\u201d The youngest of the artists, he is a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation and descended from the Pechanga Band of Luise\\u00f1o people. His work in film, photography and poetry addresses the land and family, memory and history and, he says, \\u201cwhat it means to be Indigenous right now.\\u201d As a film and electronic-arts professor at Bard College in the Hudson Valley in New York, Hopinka has assigned to his students Smithson\\u2019s freewheeling writing \\u2014 which includes imaginative rambles through suburbia (\\u201cA Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey,\\u201d 1967) and New York\\u2019s Central Park, as well as forays into sci-fi movies, geology and the notion of entropy.\", \"Though not an artist, Le Feuvre, formerly a head of sculpture studies at the Henry Moore Institute in England, is taking a self-critical approach in running the foundation. While some artist\\u2019s foundations become philanthropic juggernauts (like Warhol\\u2019s) or rule-enforcing guardians (Felix Gonzalez-Torres\\u2019s) in perpetuity, Holt/Smithson will dissolve in 2038, the year the pair would have turned 100. It intends to relinquish lands it holds to local Indigenous nations, if they want them, or to nature conservancies.\", \"There is plenty to do before then. \\u201cOur big focus is on Nancy Holt,\\u201d Le Feuvre says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not that we don\\u2019t love Robert Smithson. But Nancy Holt needs this extra attention right now.\\u201d Much of Holt\\u2019s work went unsold during her lifetime, and so the foundation inherited about 90 percent of it; Le Feuvre attributes Holt\\u2019s lower profile and commercial obscurity to the marginalization of women artists of her era and the fact that Holt spent much of her time managing Smithson\\u2019s posthumous reception. In December, Spr\\u00fcth Magers will host a show of Holt\\u2019s work at its Berlin gallery, and a retrospective is being arranged at Bildmuseet in Umea, Sweden, next year.\", \"In the meantime, there is Little Fort Island. \\u201cThere\\u2019s something quite magical about islands,\\u201d Le Feuvre says, \\u201cand what I really love about them is that islands are where you see the world first. Islands are colonized first. They\\u2019re where people are sent to if you don\\u2019t want to see them anymore. It\\u2019s where you extract wealth from the land; it\\u2019s where you see climate change.\\u201d Smithson, she says, \\u201cwas a complete, crazy island fanatic.\\u201d Although his 1970 proposal for \\u201cIsland of the Dismantled Building\\u201d (a landmass covered in construction rubble) never came to fruition, his designs for a \\u201cFloating Island\\u201d (also from 1970), a 30-by-90-foot patch of sylvan landscape atop a barge, tugged around Manhattan, did so in 2005, thanks to Holt\\u2019s persistence. \\u201cHe loved islands,\\u201d Le Feuvre continues, \\u201cbecause they are all about edges. What\\u2019s so amazing about them is that you always know the coast is behind you and in front of you.\\u201d An island can be a microcosm of the world, but it can also be a place where the status quo is upended, and anything is possible.\"]","href_hash":"49078f7643b911eca163c5165c84702b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"49078f7643b911eca163c5165c84702b"}},
