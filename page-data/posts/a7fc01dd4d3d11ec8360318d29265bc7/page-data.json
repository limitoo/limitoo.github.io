Zelinsky\", \"\\u201cRed and Green and Blue and White\\u201d is not a Hanukkah/Christmas book, exactly, and that matters. Because while it can be tempting to conflate Hanukkah and Christmas, to blend them into one candlelit season of joy, that effort can feel inauthentic to the communities that celebrate these festivals. Instead, Lee Wind makes the holidays a backdrop for a story that\\u2019s more painful, but also more honest, and more meaningful in the end.\", \"The picture book opens subtly. \\u201cOn a block dressed up in Red and Green, one house shone Blue and White.\\u201d This line doesn\\u2019t draw loud attention to the power imbalance on the street. It simply states a fact. Next we meet Isaac and Teresa, friends who celebrate different holidays. While Isaac turns on a menorah decoration in his window, Teresa trims a tree. In many ways, the kids are similar, as both play, create (Isaac writes poems while Teresa makes art) and eat treats. The Caldecott Medalist Paul O. Zelinsky\\u2019s illustrations on these pages are cheerful and bright.\", \"Then night falls, and our story shifts. All the boisterous primary colors disappear in favor of cold gray, white and brown. We see a hand hurling something at Isaac\\u2019s window. \\u201cSMASH! ... A stone! Shards of glass falling.\\u201d When the glass breaks Isaac is still awake and watches the menorah \\u201cflicker out.\\u201d\", \"The effect is startling. It is perhaps important to explain that Wind makes no attempt to describe Isaac\\u2019s terror in the moment. We see his pain in the illustrations of the aftermath, in his fearful posture and worried eyes. So much in this book is understated, left to thoughtful readers\\u2019 imaginations. But when Isaac\\u2019s mom asks whether they should light the menorah again, Isaac knows \\u201cit would be like hiding\\u201d if they didn\\u2019t. So he relights it the next night and the new window glows like the one before.\", \"Meanwhile, across the street, we see Teresa watch the blue and white lights come back on and \\u201clet out a breath she hadn\\u2019t known she was holding.\\u201d In her relief and concern, she draws a menorah on a piece of paper, writes \\u201cFor Isaac\\u201d at the top and hangs it in her own window. In short order, other friends notice Teresa\\u2019s sign and draw menorahs to hang in their windows, too. Soon the whole community has joined in. On the penultimate spread we witness joyful solidarity: a sea of windows across town decorated with paper menorahs.\", \"There\\u2019s much to admire in \\u201cRed and Green and Blue and White,\\u201d but what\\u2019s most impressive is the economy, the restraint. This is an actual child\\u2019s story, so the concrete events feel more important than attempting to explain their meaning. In a sense, the story is simple: Two children experience something scary and respond with the tools at their disposal. Their actions are powerful enough to change the world around them. It\\u2019s beautiful.\", \"On the final page, we see Isaac and Teresa together, against swirling rainbow colors and text. \\u201cChristmas tree and menorah light / Red and green and blue and white / Stronger together / Shining bright!\\u201d read the words. In this image, Isaac is again writing a poem, and Teresa is drawing a picture. But while the tableau behind them blurs and blends, Isaac\\u2019s poem is still Isaac\\u2019s, and Teresa\\u2019s picture is still Teresa\\u2019s. As simple as the book has been, there\\u2019s an unexpected complexity here. We come together in strength, the story seems to say, but we retain our distinct selves. These kids aren\\u2019t celebrating each other\\u2019s holidays so much as supporting each other\\u2019s differences. It\\u2019s a message the world can use, throughout the year.\"]","href_hash":"a7fc01dd4d3d11ec8360318d29265bc7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a7fc01dd4d3d11ec8360318d29265bc7"}},
