Sutherland, Ms. Bracken\\u2019s lawyer, said that while she had agreed as a condition of bail to follow the long list of rules laid out in the injunction meant to prevent actively obstructing construction, the photographer will not have to stay out of the exclusion zone set up by police, allowing her to continue her work.\", \"Mr. Sutherland said the submission to the court from the police made at the request of the pipeline company does not demonstrate that she violated the injunction. Nevertheless, she must appear again at a hearing on contempt of court charges on Feb. 14.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s no allegation at all against Amber Bracken which would indicate a breach of the injunction,\\u201d Mr. Sutherland said. \\u201cWe absolutely categorically deny any breach.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Toledano\\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment, but Mr. Sutherland said that he had been released on the same terms.\", \"Ms. Bracken, a freelance photographer, was on assignment for The Narwhal, an online magazine based in Toronto. Last year, she was recognized by the Canadian Association of Journalists with an award for pushing back at earlier attempts by the police to exclude journalists from reporting on demonstrations against the same pipeline. She reported on that dispute for The New York Times, among other publications.\", \"Mr. Tolendano was at the site to make a documentary for some of the Wet\\u2019suwet\\u2019en First Nation who have established a checkpoint to keep pipeline workers off the disputed land.\", \"The exact circumstances of the arrests remained unclear.\", \"In a statement, the British Columbia division of the Mounted Police said that on a forest road near a drilling site for the pipeline, officers had found \\u201cobstructions, blockades, two building-like structures as well as a wood pile that was on fire.\\u201d\", \"After the people inside the buildings were told to come out or face arrest, \\u201cofficers broke through the doors, entered the structures and arrests were made without incident,\\u201d the police said.\", \"Jennifer Wickham, the producer of Mr. Tolendano\\u2019s film and a spokeswoman for the group at the checkpoint, said in a statement that the two journalists were in a \\u201ctiny house\\u201d with several of the Indigenous protesters \\u201cwhen police broke down the door with an ax and forced their way inside with guns drawn, attack dogs in tow, and assault rifles trained on the doors and windows.\\u201d\", \"She said that the two journalists identified themselves as members of the media \\u201cand were clearly photographing the events, but were arrested nonetheless.\\u201d\", \"The arrests were swiftly condemned by a variety of groups, including the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.\", \"\\u201cThe Canadian public has a right to know what is happening on the site, and journalists have the weighty responsibility to tell these stories,\\u201d Cara Zwibel, director of the fundamental freedoms program at the association, said in a statement. \\u201cTheir arrest and ongoing detention have no place in a liberal democracy.\\u201d\", \"While politicians in Canada cannot direct police investigations and activities, Marco Mendicino, who as federal minister of public safety oversees the mounted police, challenged the arrests in a series of Twitter posts.\", \"\\u201cI am aware of and am concerned about the fact two journalists remain in custody under a civil enforcement proceeding,\\u201d he wrote, adding, \\u201cAs the courts have held, it would be wrong for any journalist to be arrested and detained simply for doing their vital work on our behalf.\\u201d\", \"This year, the Supreme Court of British Columbia has twice rebuked the Mounties for blocking journalists from covering protests against the logging of old-growth forests on Vancouver Island.\", \"In 2019, three justices of the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador unanimously reversed the conviction of Justin Brake, a Canadian journalist who was arrested in 2016 for violating an injunction against protests by Indigenous groups against a hydro electric dam project in Labrador. They found that injunctions restricting access to protest areas should not apply to journalists and emphasized in the decision the need for reporting on Indigenous issues.\", \"While Canada\\u2019s Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, the laws governing the news media are not entirely clear, said Allan Hutchinson, a professor at the Osgoode Hall Law School at York University in Toronto.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve had grave problems in trying to carve out where people can exercise that freedom of expression,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe prospects look reasonable that the court will side with media, but nothing is guaranteed in these classes.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"853111044bfa11ecb70f2336c1bf3f85"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"853111044bfa11ecb70f2336c1bf3f85"}},
