So, too, do the biggest stars \\u2014 and not just athletes but coaches, executives, team owners and television personalities, too.\", \"That relationship between celebrity and audience was tested and picked apart repeatedly in 2021. The tennis star Naomi Osaka pulled back from her sport twice, and challenged conventions about how athletes, especially women, should be treated by fans and the press. Simone Biles, the gymnast who entered the Tokyo Olympics as the face of Team U.S.A., became the talk of the Games not by competing, but by acknowledging vulnerability and withdrawing from her enormous stage.\", \"Some lighter moments showed the shrewdness of the game. Floyd Mayweather trash-talked his way into a meaningless yet marketable exhibition against the YouTube star Logan Paul. And a few bigger developments pointed toward a landscape far different from what fans have been used to. College athletes gained the right to earn money off their fame. And some of the most transcendent stars, including Tiger Woods, Roger Federer and Serena Williams, showed that their biggest championships could be exceedingly difficult to recapture.\", \"Several books in 2021 scrutinized athletes and the people around them in ways that might have appeared less obvious to casual fans a decade ago, before the coronavirus pandemic and broader cultural conversations illuminated the already changing interactions between athletes and the general public.\", \"In GIANNIS: The Improbable Rise of an NBA MVP (Hachette, 400 pp., $30), the journalist Mirin Fader details the origin story of Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Milwaukee Bucks star who was born in Greece without citizenship and eventually led his team to an N.B.A. championship in July. (The New York Times published excerpts from the book when it was released in August.)\", \"Through extensive interviews with family members, coaches, teammates, friends and others, Fader presents Antetokounmpo as a rising talent who challenged notions of race in a country that does not offer citizenship as a birthright. Antetokounmpo and his brother Thanasis Antetokounmpo were granted citizenship in 2013 because of the potential of their basketball careers. It validated for the family that they were indeed Greek, even if some people in the country had trouble accepting Black people as Greek. \\u201cThere are hundreds of Black Greek kids growing up today who may never receive the opportunities Giannis did,\\u201d Fader writes, adding: \\u201cThese kids are not embraced, affirmed, the way Giannis is now.\\u201d\", \"Antetokounmpo\\u2019s parents arrived from Nigeria in 1991, three years before he was born. The family struggled to pay for food and bounced around apartments when they could not make rent. Antetokounmpo, at 13, met a coach who persuaded him to play basketball to chase a better life. \\u201cGiannis,\\u201d an expansion of a piece Fader reported for Bleacher Report in 2019, captures an endearing portrait of Antetokounmpo by using his family as its primary through-line as he made his way to the N.B.A. and the United States.\", \"The framing makes for a more compelling journey than what would normally be expected of a parade of tough coaches, on-court rivals and personal uncertainty. And it gives the necessary heft to Antetokounmpo\\u2019s emotional speech in 2019 after he won the league\\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award.\", \"\\u201cWhen you\\u2019re a little kid, you don\\u2019t see the future, right? Your parent sees the future for you,\\u201d Antetokounmpo said of his mother, Veronica. And \\u201cshe always saw the future in us.\\u201d\", \"The unpredictability of the future is at the heart of one of the most repeated stories about the quarterback Tom Brady: He was selected No. 199 in the 2000 N.F.L. draft by the New England Patriots and Coach Bill Belichick.\", \"Football fans know (and many loathe) what came next: six Super Bowl wins over two decades together. Their dynasty has been dissected so much that even the games Brady and Belichick have played without each other the past two seasons have become markers to reassess their partnership.\", \"And yet the ESPN writer Seth Wickersham, with thorough reporting and the experience of covering New England\\u2019s twists and turns, manages a noteworthy feat in IT\\u2019S BETTER TO BE FEARED: The New England Patriots Dynasty and the Pursuit of Greatness (Norton, 528 pp., $30) \\u2014 he humanizes Brady, Belichick and the Patriots owner Robert Kraft for outsiders in a way that can be exceedingly difficult. Hate the Patriots? This is Belichick as Walter White rather than Heisenberg, and Brady with intimate moments of self-awareness about his career and personal life. Love New England? Spygate, Deflategate and the other self-inflicted problems and toxicity within the organization were probably uglier than you thought.\", \"Wickersham does not shy away from any of the problems associated with New England\\u2019s rise and eventual breakup, with Brady going to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after Belichick bet against his quarterback\\u2019s idea of throwing passes into his mid-40s. Given the team\\u2019s attitudes toward journalists over the years, Wickersham actually may have boosted his account\\u2019s credibility with Belichick, Kraft and Brady declining to be interviewed specifically for this book and Belichick dismissing its contents. Their history is told in parallel with the growth of the N.F.L. itself, including the rise of Roger Goodell to commissioner and the machinations of team owners who are used to getting what they want.\", \"Months after a tense bar outing with a former assistant coach in 2008, Belichick reflected on the personal costs of his system of demanding loyalty. \\u201cYou put a lot of time and commitment in the relationship, but it\\u2019s not easy because of the competitive part of it,\\u201d Belichick told Wickersham. \\u201cYou really do care about each other, after all you\\u2019ve been through, and for all of that to dissipate because you\\u2019re in a competitive situation \\u2014 you\\u2019d like to find a way to keep both going in the right balance, and it\\u2019s not always the easiest thing to do.\\u201d\", \"Wickersham lays out the strains in the Brady-Belichick relationship over hundreds of pages. The Chicago Bulls great Scottie Pippen immediately goes after Michael Jordan in UNGUARDED (Atria, 320 pp., $28), a book that could more accurately be titled \\u201cDefensive.\\u201d\", \"Co-authored with the sportswriter Michael Arkush, the book is worthwhile for the 14-page prologue alone. Pippen offers a fiery rebuke to \\u201cThe Last Dance,\\u201d the Jordan-produced documentary that became a sensation during the early stages of the pandemic.\", \"Pippen believes he and his teammates don\\u2019t get enough credit for Chicago\\u2019s success in the 1990s, and that Jordan played down their roles to boost himself for younger N.B.A. fans who may favor LeBron James in discussions about all-time greats. \\u201cHe couldn\\u2019t have been more condescending if he tried. On second thought, I could believe my eyes. I spent a lot of time around the man. I knew what made him tick. How na\\u00efve I was to expect anything else,\\u201d Pippen writes.\", \"Pippen\\u2019s description of his own journey is certainly fascinating at times, as when he describes his roots in the small town of Hamburg, Ark., where his father struggled with arthritis and a stroke and where his brother was paralyzed by a school bully\\u2019s sucker punch. He connects his upbringing with his decision to sign an undervalued contract extension in 1991.\", \"\\u201cBecause of what happened to my brother and father, I learned early on how everything in your life can be taken away without the slightest warning,\\u201d Pippen said. \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t afford the risk I would get injured and end up with nothing.\\u201d\", \"Sadly, too many of Pippen\\u2019s other opportunities for reflection are overridden by defensiveness, anger or a lack of self-awareness or empathy. Sometimes the blame-shifting is trivial and funny: He holds Jordan and the coach Doug Collins to account for a 1988 stretch in which he missed 11 of 12 free throws. \\u201cI was to blame, needless to say. Although not entirely. Doug and Michael were also partly responsible,\\u201d he writes. \\u201cIn many games I barely touched the basketball. As a result, I couldn\\u2019t sustain any rhythm.\\u201d\", \"But Pippen shows more serious moments of dissonance, too.\", \"In perhaps the book\\u2019s most reflective moment, Pippen details his regret over not reaching out to Jordan after Jordan\\u2019s father died. \\u201cLooking back, I wish I could blame my youth for being so incredibly insensitive. I can\\u2019t. There is no excuse,\\u201d Pippen says. \\u201cA friend of mine lost his father and I didn\\u2019t say a word to him. I will have to live with that for the rest of my life.\\u201d\", \"Yet in the same chapter, he chides Jordan for not telephoning him after he was criticized for sitting out the last 1.8 seconds of a playoff game because he was angry that Phil Jackson, the team\\u2019s coach, had called for a teammate, Toni Kukoc, to take what became the game-winning shot. \\u201cNot that I expected Michael to call,\\u201d Pippen said. \\u201cThat would have been out of character for him. Then again, I didn\\u2019t call him, either.\\u201d Of course, it\\u2019s unclear how firm Pippen is on his own sentiments.\", \"In June, he said that he believed Jackson\\u2019s decision to turn to Kukoc, who is white, was motivated by racism. Pippen, who is Black, walks that claim back in his book: \\u201cI told myself at the time that Phil\\u2019s decision must have been racially motivated, and I allowed myself to believe that lie for nearly 30 years. Only when I saw my words in print did it dawn on me how wrong I was.\\u201d\", \"Then, while promoting the book, Pippen seemed to deny his own denial, which he attempted to clarify during a recent interview with The New York Times: \\u201cI feel like it was a moment where he did me wrong. How about that? How about I answer your question that way.\\u201d\", \"Posing questions to athletes, especially on television, has long been considered a dream career, and many sportscasters have become celebrities themselves, including Howard Cosell, Hannah Storm and Maria Taylor. Unfortunately, for women that fame also carries downsides that are not experienced by men \\u2014 scorn and scrutiny that arise precisely because they are women.\", \"Guy Harrison, an assistant professor of journalism and electronic media at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, makes this argument in ON THE SIDELINES: Gendered Neoliberalism and the American Female Sportscaster (University of Nebraska, 186 pp., $99) and adds that the many problems women face as sportscasters speak to wider ideas about feminism.\", \"His is a scholarly discussion that challenges both fans and media professionals to look inward rather than dismiss problems like online trolls, harassment, sexism and racism as simply the cost of becoming a public figure. \\u201cThe idealized female sportscaster subject is someone who the industry and its consumers expect to be an always autonomous and entrepreneurial figure, capable of successfully navigating gendered barriers \\u2014 such as sexual harassment \\u2014 and persevering,\\u201d Harrison writes.\", \"Harrison conducted focus groups of consumers and interviews with 10 women in various on-air roles. The professionals tell stories about poor treatment by co-workers and athletes, while the focus groups demonstrate beliefs that fall into negative stereotypes. The discussion can get a little arcane at times \\u2014 an explanation of the term \\u201cpostfeminism\\u201d includes a breakdown of why Harrison doesn\\u2019t hyphenate the word \\u2014 but the stories of sexism and professional double standards are resonant about an industry that has favored white men.\", \"They also apply beyond sideline reporters and on-air talent, and Harrison\\u2019s discussion could have benefited from more breadth and acknowledgment of how those relationships intertwine. \\u201cThere are other media industries that rely on the presentation of attractive women to draw an audience. Sports media organizations are not among those industries and need not try to be,\\u201d Harrison says.\", \"That ideal is certainly fair. But given how media companies operate, it is unrealistic to consider decisions about sports separately from decisions about other forms of entertainment programming.\", \"In college sports, many of the most important decisions have centered on the large television contracts that have become the primary moneymakers for the top university athletic programs. In THE BIG EAST: Inside the Most Entertaining and Influential Conference in College Basketball History (Ballantine, 272 pp., $28), the journalist Dana O\\u2019Neil tells the story of a league driven by men\\u2019s basketball, the sport that, along with football, has made college athletics a multibillion-dollar behemoth.\", \"The twists of the Big East Conference, known for its gritty teams and stars, including Patrick Ewing of Georgetown and Chris Mullin of St. John\\u2019s, are presented largely through the eyes of the coaches who became the faces of their teams: John Thompson Jr. at Georgetown, Jim Boeheim at Syracuse, Jim Calhoun at Connecticut and others.\", \"That presentation is consistent with how college basketball teams and conferences focus on coaches, which is much different from the athlete-driven N.B.A. O\\u2019Neil, who has more than 30 years of experience reporting on the Big East, draws readers into a series of romps with the league\\u2019s marquee names.\", \"Formed in 1979, the Big East built its reputation with tough games and siblinglike relationships among coaches and administrators. And with national championships came grandeur and a television contract with ESPN, though the league became caught up in a realignment of conferences that ultimately led to a split. \\u201cMention of the conference conjures up a well of sentiment, a heavy dose of yarn-spinning and more than a little awe at what everyone got away with,\\u201d O\\u2019Neil writes.\", \"There are moments throughout the book where it is difficult not to think about the tales of lavish outings (ostensibly for business) in a more modern context. One such episode is a coaches\\u2019 meeting in 1988 at a luxury Florida golf resort. P.J. Carlesimo, the coach of Seton Hall, encourages the Big East newcomer Rick Barnes of Providence to stack up on shirts and other items at a pro shop and charge them to the conference. \\u201c\\u2018I might have done that,\\u2019 Carlesimo says now with a chuckle,\\u201d O\\u2019Neil writes.\", \"Left unsaid, perhaps because it is so obvious, is that the misadventures of the highly paid coaches and administrators contrast with how their athletes were treated. The N.C.A.A. agreed this year, under pressure, to allow students who play sports to make some outside money from their fame.\", \"Of course, many college athletes have become more vocal in recent years about their circumstances as well as about broader social issues. Many who have demonstrated have nodded toward Colin Kaepernick, the N.F.L. quarterback who used the playing of the U.S. national anthem to protest police brutality and systemic inequity and subsequently found himself unable to secure a roster spot.\", \"In THE KAEPERNICK EFFECT: Taking a Knee, Changing the World (New Press, 240 pp., $25.99), Dave Zirin, the sports editor of The Nation, tells the individual stories of dozens of athletes who were inspired by Kaepernick to demonstrate. \\u201cThey are bound together by a belief in racial justice,\\u201d Zirin writes. He adds: \\u201cThey are bound together by the idea that they needed to take Kaepernick\\u2019s effort to start a conversation and put it into action. They are bound together by the strength to withstand backlash. They braved death threats. They stood up to bigots. They were in some cases threatened with expulsion from their team.\\u201d Through a series of vignettes, athletes share what led to their protests and their views of how their teams, families and others in their communities reacted to their demonstrations.\", \"These stories give a pointed sense of why the athletes would be willing to risk alienating themselves from their teams. \\u201cNothing in life is going to start by being silent,\\u201d said Winston Jones, a forward on the 2017 men\\u2019s basketball team at St. Michael\\u2019s College in Vermont.\", \"The stories are interesting, emotional and sincere. But Zirin misses opportunities by not talking often enough with the people around the players: teammates, administrators, coaches, parents and others. Their perspectives would have rounded out Zirin\\u2019s reporting, especially concerning the most severe claims of mistreatment. Some of the accounts end too early, as well, with little attention paid to what happened after a protest and the immediate reaction to it.\", \"Zirin\\u2019s point of view is clear. He supports the athletes and, with some noted exceptions, sees team and league administrators as obstructionists who favor their own business needs. But the oversimplification of some of the vignettes could carry an unintended effect: People who aren\\u2019t already predisposed to agree may dismiss the athletes prematurely.\"]","href_hash":"9a0686eb542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9a0686eb542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}},
