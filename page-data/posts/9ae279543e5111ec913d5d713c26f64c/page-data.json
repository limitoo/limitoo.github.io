It allowed residents to arrest each other if they had reasonable suspicion that someone had committed a felony and the police were not present. \", \"The defendants have said they thought Mr. Arbery was guilty of burglaries in the area when they chased him. No evidence has been produced to show that to be true.\", \"The jury will have to consider if the men reasonably suspected that Mr. Arbery had committed a felony.\", \"These kinds of laws exist in many states, but they are not uniform. Similar to \\u201cstand your ground\\u201d and \\u201ccastle doctrine\\u201d laws that allow people to use force to protect themselves or their homes, citizen\\u2019s arrest laws have come to national attention over the years. Critics argue that they enable people to act out of pre-existing biases and help foment environments where extrajudicial killings happen.\", \"\\u201cThis is based on racism,\\u201d said Ira P. Robbins, a law professor at American University who wrote an academic paper on the issue. \\u201cYou look at the Georgia law, for example. This is a law that was used for white people to help catch escaping slaves. There is a close connection between citizen\\u2019s arrest laws in the South and lynchings.\\u201d\", \"Among the criticisms of these kinds of laws is the belief that ordinary citizens are not well-versed in the complexities of the law when they take things into their own hands. \\u201cIt\\u2019s scary because it allows for vigilante injustice,\\u201d Mr. Robbins said.\", \"Georgia lawmakers partly dismantled the citizen\\u2019s arrest law last spring in response to Mr. Arbery\\u2019s killing, repealing the portion of the law that allowed a private person to arrest someone if that person witnessed \\u2014 or was told about \\u2014 a crime, or if someone suspected of committing a felony was trying to escape. The legislation carved out some exceptions for business owners, who can detain people on \\u201creasonable grounds\\u201d if they are suspected of shoplifting or other thefts. Other exceptions apply to licensed private detectives and security guards.\", \"Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, called the former statute \\u201can antiquated law that is ripe for abuse.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9ae279543e5111ec913d5d713c26f64c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9ae279543e5111ec913d5d713c26f64c"}},
