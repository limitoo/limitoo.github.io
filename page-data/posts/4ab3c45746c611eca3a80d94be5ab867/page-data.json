Get away from city light \\u2014 \\u201cthe darker, the better,\\u201d he says \\u2014 and find a place with as much visible sky as possible, like a spot in the mountains or desert. Close your eyes for a few minutes, to speed up their adaptation to the dark. \\u201cIf you have to have lights,\\u201d Oluseyi says, \\u201cthey should be red lights.\\u201d\", \"What we call shooting stars are chunks from comets and asteroids that can be seen year-round. But many more shooting stars are visible when the earth passes through debris fields at the same time every year. \\u201cWe call those meteor showers,\\u201d Oluseyi says. The Perseids and Leonids are typically the most reliable, in August and November. They\\u2019re as predictable as the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone, he says. During other times of year, check the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center for updates. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just like taking a fishing trip: You check the weather first because you\\u2019d want to know what\\u2019s happening in the sky before you go,\\u201d Oluseyi says. Check the earth weather in advance too.\", \"Even in clear skies, it can take awhile, sometimes a few hours, before you see what you want, so go with friends to make the long outings more engaging. You don\\u2019t have to limit yourself to waiting for only shooting stars. Indeed, sometimes it helps to scan for other things. \\u201cYou can look for satellites and constellations and double stars,\\u201d Oluseyi says. \\u201cYou can try to find Andromeda. Every time I go somewhere new, all over the earth, I gotta see what the night sky looks like from where I am.\\u201d Look up and let the shooting stars surprise you: \\u201cSuddenly you see something out of the corner of your eye and you turn your head and this bright, like, \\u2018Woo\\u2019 thing happens.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4ab3c45746c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4ab3c45746c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
