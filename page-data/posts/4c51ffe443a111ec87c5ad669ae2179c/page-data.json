In 2017, we began partnering with the New York Public Library to administer the honor now called The New York Times/New York Public Library Best Illustrated Children\\u2019s Books Award.\", \"The judges select the 10 winners purely on the basis of artistic merit. On the 2021 panel were Catherine Hong, a children\\u2019s literature critic; Jessica Agudelo, a youth collections librarian at the New York Public Library; and Paul O. Zelinsky, a Caldecott Medal-winning illustrator of many acclaimed picture books \\u2014 most recently \\u201cRed and Green and Blue and White,\\u201d by Lee Wind \\u2014 and a past winner of the award.\", \"Here you\\u2019ll find images from each winning book.\", \"The opening subway scenes suggest yet another picture book interested more in elegant design and beautiful, muted watercolor than in people or stories. But as the narrator (a subway train!) starts describing its life and the lives of its riders, gray faceless figures take on detail and luminous color \\u2014 a trove of richness we had no access to when they were strangers to us. A brilliant turnaround, a great concept and an endearing book. Not to mention its elegant design and beautiful watercolor.\", \"\\u2014 Paul O. Zelinsky\", \"Scribble, $18.99; ages 3 to 10.\", \"Awash in nocturnal blue, Dorl\\u00e9ans\\u2019s graphite pencil illustrations of a family of nighttime explorers evoke a luminous sense of wonder. From bedside lamps to the delicate beam of stars, hints of light punctuate each spread, cleverly directing the reader\\u2019s attention to hidden details \\u2014 an owl atop a tree, a badger skulking in the grass, a pair of mice among the rocks \\u2014 and reflecting the warm bond of a family.\", \"\\u2014 Jessica Agudelo\", \"Floris, $17.95; ages 4 to 8.\", \"An exploration of the concept of time is a daunting premise for a children\\u2019s book, but Morstad pulls it off with panache. Her warm, friendly renderings in pencil, marker and ink distill the book\\u2019s abstract ideas \\u2014 does time move slowly or quickly, in a straight line or a circle? \\u2014 with ingenuity and simplicity. The judges also appreciated Morstad\\u2019s judicious use of empty space, which leaves ample room for thought.\", \"\\u2014 Catherine Hong\", \"Tundra, $18.99; ages 3 to 7.\", \"Step right up and gaze upon the Fan brothers\\u2019 latest surreal world, featuring a cast of stylish insects, fitted with fanciful hats, as they marvel at the sight of an unfamiliar orb. Black-and-white graphite drawings, brilliant pops of color and a fiendishly expressive spider, all scrupulously rendered, convey the feel of a silent film.\", \"\\u2014 J.A.\", \"Simon & Schuster, $17.99; ages 4 to 8.\", \"This remixed fairy tale was an instant hit with our judges, who admired the way Gauld\\u2019s comics-style illustrations are simultaneously flat-out simple (its main characters are, after all, stick figures) and complex (the royal inventor\\u2019s chockablock workshop). Meticulous, diagrammatic and, yes, awfully cute, these boldly outlined, crosshatched images amplify the story\\u2019s deadpan humor and are as delightful to behold as the story\\u2019s happily-ever-after ending.\", \"\\u2014 C.H.\", \"Neal Porter/Holiday House, $18.99; ages 4 to 8.\", \"Ra\\u00fal the Third\\u2019s dynamic use of panels draws attention to every corner of the page, bursting with clever detail. His vivid cartoon style is enlivened by his signature hand lettering and Elaine Bay\\u2019s palette of purple tones, creating a visually rich and utterly fun homage to border town life.\", \"\\u2014 J.A.\", \"Versify, $14.99; ages 4 to 7.\", \"In one of the year\\u2019s most unusual-looking books, Broadley has turned a quiet meditation on nighttime, both sleepy and sleepless, into a manically pulsating graphic experience that is as rewarding as it is unexpected. With the look of elaborate colored woodcuts, the highly stylized pictures transport us to a world of their own.\", \"\\u2014 P.Z.\", \"Pavilion, $19.95; ages 4 to 8.\", \"\\u201cUnspeakable\\u201d tells the story of the thriving Black community of Tulsa, Okla., and its destruction at the hands of racist mobs on one terrible day in 1921. To know that Cooper\\u2019s own grandfather was a member of that community, and passed down stories about the day, adds yet more dimension to the profound emotion this book elicits. Small wonder that Cooper\\u2019s exquisitely rendered faces are masterpieces of empathy. Bold in design, subtle in color, \\u201cUnspeakable\\u201d is Cooper\\u2019s last book; he died in July.\", \"\\u2014 P.Z.\", \"Carolrhoda, $17.99; ages 8 to 12.\", \"Floca\\u2019s images of New York City and the essential workers who have kept the city alive throughout the Covid-19 pandemic are conjured in delicate lines and subdued watercolor hues, beautifully echoing the quiet, often unsung nature of their heroism. Refreshingly, there are no clich\\u00e9d street scenes of the Big Apple here. Floca has captured an insider\\u2019s view of the transformed city with love and tenderness.\", \"\\u2014 C.H.\", \"Caitlyn Dlouhy/Atheneum, $17.99; ages 4 to 8.\", \"With its anthropomorphized characters dressed in knickers and its murky, moody palette, this book \\u2014 about a young bunny and his father who long to know what\\u2019s on the other side of a forbidding forest \\u2014 feels like a vintage gem. While the images channel some of the comforting qualities of Beatrix Potter\\u2019s, they also have unsettling and surreal qualities that recall artists like Henry Darger and Amy Cutler, lending this fable-like story a tantalizing undercurrent of darkness.\", \"\\u2014 C.H.\"]","href_hash":"4c51ffe443a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4c51ffe443a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}},
