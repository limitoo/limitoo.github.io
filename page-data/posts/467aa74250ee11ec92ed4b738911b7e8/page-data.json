State agencies and private companies went to work building hundreds of wind and solar farms to power businesses, vehicles and homes.\", \"But there is a problem.\", \"New York effectively has two separate electrical grids: upstate, where most of the state\\u2019s growing clean-power supply is generated, and in and around New York City, the area that consumes the most energy and relies most heavily on power from fossil fuels. The power lines that connect the two, already clogged with a traffic jam of electrons, cannot carry more. \", \"Gov. Kathy Hochul has announced two massive transmission-line projects to help bridge that divide, a step that environmental advocates hope is a sign that she is accelerating the state\\u2019s efforts to address climate change and environmental inequities. \", \"By law, New York has just nine years to more than double the share of the electricity it uses that is generated from wind, sun and water to 70 percent, from less than 30 percent today. \", \"That requires unifying and expanding the state\\u2019s divided electrical grid and reshaping it to work less like a one-way transmitter and more like an ecosystem. The grid must grow to supply 75 percent more power by 2040, and be flexible: On blustery days it should send surplus wind power north from turbines off Long Island to consumers upstate, and in summer send plentiful energy south from rural solar farms to the city. \", \"The governor unveiled the transmission-line projects amid a series of steps to cut emissions and redress environmental inequalities, including doubling the state\\u2019s solar energy expansion goal and creating a program to improve air quality in low-income, long-polluted areas. \", \"Last month, Ms. Hochul\\u2019s administration blocked upgrades to two gas-fueled power plants, weighing in on a critical debate over whether the state should immediately stop permitting new fossil-fuel infrastructure. \", \"\\u201cGoals are goals,\\u201d Ms. Hochul, who attended the global climate conference in Glasgow, said earlier of the state\\u2019s climate law. \\u201cI want results.\\u201d\", \"The new transmission lines promise to bring renewable energy directly to New York City, aimed at making the state\\u2019s \\u201ctale of two grids\\u201d \\u2014 cleaner upstate and heavily reliant on fossil fuel downstate \\u2014 \\u201ca thing of the past,\\u201d said Doreen Harris, who heads the state\\u2019s energy development agency. At last analysis, just 21 percent of the city\\u2019s power came from sources that do not emit planet-warming gases \\u2014 a fraction that soon fell to 3 percent with the closure of the Indian Point nuclear plant. \", \"One line, called Clean Path New York, will stretch 179 miles from Delaware County in the Western Catskills to a substation on the East River. Another, the Champlain Hudson Power Express, will run a buried cable from Canada down the Hudson River to Queens. The Champlain Hudson line will be built and owned by the global investment firm Blackstone, while the Clean Path will be controlled by the New York Power Authority and private developers. The developers have agreed to 25-year contracts.\", \"The state has not released details of the projects\\u2019 costs or expected effect on New Yorkers\\u2019 electricity bills. What is known is that the projects will cost billions of dollars, much of it funded by private companies, and amount to the state\\u2019s largest infrastructure investments in years. Together with recently greenlit offshore wind projects, the transmission lines set the state on track to meet its 2030 goal of getting 70 percent of the electricity consumed in the state from renewable sources. \", \"But the path remains murky to the state\\u2019s tighter 2040 target of using 100 percent energy from renewable or nuclear sources. \", \"Pulling off a transition to renewable energy will require the state to navigate political, economic and technological challenges. \", \"Deciding whether to approve new gas pipeline and power-plant projects pending in Brooklyn, for instance, will force the state to side with either environmental advocates or gas and power utilities. Building hundreds of wind and solar farms means sometimes contending with local opposition; a new state law allows renewable-energy developers to override local regulators, but that too may cause backlash. \", \"The transition will also take careful economic planning, energy analysts caution: In a future where everything from home heat to transportation is powered by electricity, the price and reliability of that electricity will matter more than ever.\", \"State regulators selected projects they believe will maintain that balance. The Clean Path line will tap the state\\u2019s growing wind and solar energy supply, carrying it along routes where the state already has the right to build power lines. The private developers on the project include global energy developer Invenergy and the real estate developer Related.\", \"The investment from Related \\u2014 a company better known for giant real estate developments like Hudson Yards in Manhattan \\u2014 is another indication of how deeply new climate polices would transform the state\\u2019s economy. A raft of new climate regulations includes carrots and sticks pushing companies to venture into renewable energy. \", \"In Related\\u2019s case, building the transmission line gets the company renewable-energy credits that it can sell at a profit. That will help offset hefty penalties Related says it will owe, under a new city law, for fossil-fuel energy used by its buildings, even new, energy-efficient ones.\", \"The other project, Champlain Hudson, is even more ambitious, reaching 339 miles to pull down enough hydropower to deliver 20 percent of the energy New York City uses on an average day. Sophie Brochu, president and chief executive of Canada\\u2019s state-owned utility, Hydro-Qu\\u00e9bec, which will supply the power, called it \\u201can umbilical cord\\u201d from the dams in the far reaches of Qu\\u00e9bec to Queens.\", \"Over the course of the project\\u2019s circuitous, 10-year trajectory, the line\\u2019s promised output has grown by a quarter as technology has improved. The route has changed as well \\u2014 stretching and twisting in response to local opposition. \", \"Opposition was varied: Local power producers objected to buying Canadian energy. Environmental groups warned of disturbances to wildlife. Seven Hudson Valley towns said construction would stir up toxins in the river that supplies their drinking water. In Canada, some Indigenous groups have contended the export violates their territory and environment.\", \"Transmission Developers, the Blackstone-backed company that will build and own the line, says it has worked closely with opponents to find safe solutions, including financing environmental research and negotiating partnerships and benefits with affected Indigenous populations: Donald Jessome, the chief executive, said the company reached out to all affected \\u201cright from Day 1.\\u201d \", \"Hydro-Qu\\u00e9bec has offered a partnership stake with the Mohawk tribe, said a leader, Mike Delisle, although the details have not been hammered out. \", \"\\u201cIt is a true partnership,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe will be co-owners with the 57-kilometer line that goes from our territory.\\u201d\", \"But not all Indigenous groups have been included to the same degree. \", \"\\u201cWe still disagree with the project,\\u201d said Lucien Wabanonik, a leader with the Lac Simon council in Quebec who has opposed Hydro-Qu\\u00e9bec exports to the U.S., saying they would have \\u201cbig consequences\\u201d for the land, people and wildlife in the area. \", \"\\u201cWe as a nation did not get any compensation,\\u201d he said, adding: \\u201cStolen land, stolen resources.\\u201d\", \"For Ms. Hochul\\u2019s administration, it seemed the benefits of the project \\u2014 1250 megawatts of reliable, renewable hydropower, delivered straight to New York City, with most permits already approved \\u2014 outweighed any potential backlash. \", \"The main reason: Hydropower produces guaranteed energy every day of the year, a critical backstop as New York begins to increasingly rely on energy sources that are clean but intermittent because supply varies with weather. Wind power delivers about 30 percent annually of the energy it could produce if, hypothetically, it ran on full capacity every day; solar produces less than 15 percent, according to findings of the New York Independent System Operator, the organization that ensures a reliable power supply.\", \"There are other challenges: Even if the state can build enough solar and wind farms, and a grid to support them, today\\u2019s energy storage systems can only hold an eight-hour electricity supply. . Developing technology like green hydrogen, which could be critical for sectors like steel and cement production looking to decarbonize, is not yet available on a commercial scale.\", \"Gavin Donahue, president of the Independent Power Producers of New York, which represents both fossil fuels and renewables, said meeting the goals would require a \\u201cherculean\\u201d effort that will \\u201cfundamentally change\\u201d New Yorkers\\u2019 way of life. \", \"\\u201cThere will have to be real \\u2014 and very difficult \\u2014 conversations on the horizon,\\u201d he said.\", \"But breaking ground at what will be a massive new green hydrogen facility in Genesee County recently, Ms. Hochul was enthusiastic about New York\\u2019s potential. \", \"\\u201cThis is the place where the clean energy revolution is happening,\\u201d she exclaimed, later adding: \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be an all-the-above approach.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"467aa74250ee11ec92ed4b738911b7e8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"467aa74250ee11ec92ed4b738911b7e8"}},
