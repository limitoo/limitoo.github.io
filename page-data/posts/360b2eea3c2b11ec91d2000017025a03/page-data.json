You can sign up here to receive it on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\", \"Six years ago in Paris, world leaders celebrated a breakthrough in global climate politics: After more than two decades of failure, nearly every country finally agreed to reduce \\u201cas soon as possible\\u201d the amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases they were pumping into the atmosphere.\", \"Those leaders knew, though, that their pledges were woefully insufficient to avert disaster and would need to be ratcheted up at a later date. That is why they have gathered in Glasgow this week, and it also why John Kerry, the Biden administration\\u2019s climate czar, called the summit the \\u201clast best hope for the world to get its act together.\\u201d\", \"So how\\u2019s the world doing? Here\\u2019s what people are saying about how to think about the summit, what \\u201csuccess\\u201d there might look like and what the implications will be for global climate politics if it isn\\u2019t achieved.\", \"Global temperatures have already warmed by 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. A decade ago, the world was on pace to warm by a total of 4 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, an outcome widely seen as catastrophic.\", \"But over the past 10 years, greenhouse gas emissions have been falling in many countries, including the United States. As a result, the end-of-the-century projection now hovers around 3 degrees of warming.\", \"\\u201cThere has been a genuine shift over the past decade,\\u201d Niklas H\\u00f6hne, a German climatologist, told The Times\\u2019s Brad Plumer and Nadja Popovich. \\u201cYou can say that progress has been too slow, that it\\u2019s still not enough, and I agree with all that. But we do see real movement.\\u201d\", \"The reason for much of the movement is technological:\", \"But scientists say the current trajectory is still nothing to celebrate. The United Nations climate science body recently warned that at sustained global warming levels between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, which together hold enough water to raise global sea levels nearly 40 feet, could melt irreversibly for thousands of years until they virtually disappear. That would condemn future generations to a relentless rise in sea levels that would sink many of the world\\u2019s great coastal cities.\", \"[\\u201c\\u2018Bad For Humans\\u2019: The World Is On Track To Warm 3 Degrees Celsius This Century\\u201d]\", \"To avoid such scenarios, Fred Pearce notes at Yale Environment 360, it is not enough for world leaders to keep promising net-zero emissions by 2050. They will have to take much more ambitious steps to slash their emissions by 2030.\", \"At least 140 countries did make new commitments before Glasgow to do so. But even if countries follow through on these new commitments \\u2014 and that\\u2019s a big if \\u2014 the world could still warm by about 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100. That is well beyond both the 2 degree limit enshrined in the Paris climate agreement and its aspirational target of 1.5 degrees.\", \"\\u201cThe good news is that the 2050 net-zero targets for the first time put the \\u2018well below\\u2019 2 degrees and 1.5 limits of the Paris agreement within reach,\\u201d H\\u00f6hne told Pearce. \\u201cBut the bad news is that no single country is on target to implement the short-term 2030 policies needed to be on track to meet their own net-zero targets.\\u201d\", \"In Foreign Affairs, the economist William Nordhaus argued last month that international climate policy has failed in part because of what economists call the \\u201cfree rider\\u201d problem: The benefits of reducing emissions are broadly shared, but the costs \\u2014 including, crucially, profits lost by leaving fossil fuels in the ground \\u2014 are nationally borne, which incentivizes countries to rely, or free-ride, on others to take action.\", \"[\\u201cNot one single country on earth is willing to stop extracting fossil fuels\\u201d]\", \"When it comes to climate change, not all free riders are created equal. Today, the Group of 20 \\u2014 19 countries and the European Union that represent most of the world\\u2019s economic output \\u2014 accounts for 80 percent of the world\\u2019s yearly emissions. Assign national responsibility for every ton of greenhouse gas that humans have put in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution, and the tally becomes even starker: One-quarter came from the United States, a share that\\u2019s slightly larger than the E.U.\\u2019s and about twice as large as China\\u2019s.\", \"Because of this historical \\u201cclimate debt,\\u201d many lower-income countries say their actions will depend on those of richer countries. Especially after President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris agreement, many world leaders were eager to see President Biden come to Glasgow having secured some legislative achievement that matched his rhetoric on climate change.\", \"But Biden has no such achievement in hand: His own party has pared back his climate plan working its way through Congress, stripping the legislative sticks meant to draw down the use of fossil fuels and leaving only carrots for the deployment of emissions-free energy. Those carrots could still \\u201cprobably get us close\\u201d to Biden\\u2019s climate pledges, The Atlantic\\u2019s Robinson Meyer writes, but passage is far from guaranteed.\", \"[\\u201cThe U.S. Is Not a Climate Leader\\u201d]\", \"Aid is another factor at play. In 2009, rich countries pledged to give $100 billion a year to help poor countries address climate change, but they haven\\u2019t kept their promise. Diplomats from Canada and Germany last week expressed \\u201cconfidence\\u201d the goal would be met in 2023.\", \"But after a decade of inaction, that goal may now be out of date. \\u201c$100 billion a year is nowhere sufficient to adapt to the damages brought on by climate disruptions, let alone pivot the energy systems of poor countries away from fossil fuels,\\u201d The Times\\u2019s Somini Sengupta reports.\", \"The ethical calculus of climate action is further complicated by the fact that some large developing countries have become major emitters. China is now the world\\u2019s largest, having surpassed the United States in 2006, with the European Union in third place and India in fourth.\", \"China and India, in particular, have come under fire for not making bigger commitments ahead of Glasgow. In the near term, China has promised only that its annual emissions will peak sometime before 2030, which Kerry said \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t advance the ball sufficiently.\\u201d India has not even set such a date, arguing that it is still much poorer than other major emitters and needs more time to develop.\", \"It is because of these competing demands of fairness, political possibility and scientific necessity that climate diplomacy often finds itself at an impasse. \\u201cLeaders in China and India argue that when the U.S. and other countries were emerging from poverty in the past, they didn\\u2019t have to worry about what kind of energy sources they were using,\\u201d The Times\\u2019s David Leonhardt writes. But \\u201cIf China cares as little about the planet as England did during the Industrial Revolution, everybody will suffer.\\u201d\", \"[\\u201cChina can make or break a global climate deal. What will it be willing to give?\\u201d]\", \"Last week, Kerry\\u2019s message about the summit abruptly changed: \\u201cGlasgow was never going to be, you know, the definitive one meeting,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was going to galvanize the raising of ambition on a global basis.\\u201d\", \"Kerry\\u2019s reversal may be nothing more than an attempt by the Biden administration to save face. But he\\u2019s not alone in downplaying the summit\\u2019s significance. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to categorically trash the [U.N. process] and throw the baby out with the bath water, but it\\u2019s time to be realistic about what it can and can\\u2019t do,\\u201d Jessica Green, a professor of political science who focuses on climate governance, told James Temple at the MIT Technology Review.\", \"What\\u2019s the alternative? One, Temple writes, is something called \\u201cexperimentalist governance,\\u201d a model in which smaller institutions and governments that don\\u2019t need global consensus can set binding standards that prompt broader changes in polluting industries. One example that proponents of \\u201cexperimentalist governance\\u201d point to is California\\u2019s regulation of vehicle pollution, which arguably helped push automakers to develop electric vehicles.\", \"[\\u201cHow to Fix the Climate\\u201d]\", \"\\u201cThe hope,\\u201d Temple explains, \\u201cis that a variety of governments or regulators trying a variety of approaches can provide critical lessons on what does and doesn\\u2019t work, and drive a process that makes it cheaper and easier for other areas to enact emissions reduction policies and adopt cleaner technologies.\\u201d\", \"Some of the technologies on which climate hopes get pinned are nascent, like carbon capture, and it\\u2019s not clear when or if they will ever reach mass commercial viability.\", \"But for rich nations to shift away from fossil fuels \\u201cdoes not depend on huge scientific breakthroughs, welcome as they would be,\\u201d Leonhardt points out. \\u201cIt can happen largely with existing technologies, like wind, solar and nuclear power and the electrification of vehicles.\\u201d And despite the free-rider problem, countries do have some self-interested reasons to reduce pollution from fossil fuels.\", \"Depending on how you look at it, putting one\\u2019s faith in a more piecemeal approach to stopping climate change might seem both hopelessly quixotic and more realistic than the exclusively top-down diplomatic model at work today. As Greta Thunberg recently said in an Opinion Video essay: \\u201cAll political and economic systems have failed, but humanity has not yet failed.\\u201d\", \"Do you have a point of view we missed?
