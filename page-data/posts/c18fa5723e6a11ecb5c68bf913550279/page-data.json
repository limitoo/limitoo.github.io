An Ulster County judge denied him bail on November 4. Baldner is also accused of pepper-spraying the vehicle that the Goods family occupied and ramming his car into theirs twice, causing it to flip. He has been indicted on charges of murder, manslaughter and reckless endangerment.\", \"Baldner's lawyers had requested a $100,000 cash bail and home confinement, which the judge denied. The New York state troopers' Police Benevolent Association has provided legal representation for the former trooper, who was suspended without pay.\", \"This was not the only time Baldner has been accused of ramming a vehicle and endangering lives. His denial of bail is also the result of a 2019 incident in which he \\\"endangered the lives of three passengers\\\" after ramming his car into theirs. He allegedly also had a similar incident in 2017.\", \"\\\"Rather than being accidental, the defendant's actions on December 22 were deliberate, willful, and depraved,\\\" said Assistant Attorney General Jennifer Gashi in court.\", \"Monica's family supported the decision to deny bail, with her mother, Michelle Surrency, saying outside of court that \\\"he got reprimanded...that's where he deserves to be.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1921388/file-photo-teddy-police-car.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A young girl was killed after the car she was in was rammed by a trooper and flipped; the police officer chargedin the incident has been denied bail. Above, a teddy bear in a police car. </div>\", \"The Goods family was traveling through the Hudson Valley on the New York State Thruway when Baldner stopped them for speeding.\", \"It is alleged that Baldner then used his police vehicle to ram the Goods' SUV, causing it to flip over several times until it came to rest upside down, according to prosecutors.\", \"The case is being prosecuted by the office of Attorney General Letitia James, which has jurisdiction over deaths caused by police officers.\", \"\\\"You have a trooper that has lived in this area for almost two decades. He has a family, he has kids, he owns a house. He's not going anywhere,\\\" Thomas Mungeer, president of the state troopers' Police Benevolent Association, said outside of court.\", \"Supporters of the Goods family demonstrated outside of court.\", \"Local news station CBS New York reported that Baldner stopped Tristin Goods after he was driving at more than 100 mph on I-87. Baldner's defense team had also offered his passport, which was also denied. The Ulster County District Attorney is looking into whether Monica's father could face charges for his actions during the incident. Baldner is expected to be back in court in February, and protesters say they will be advocating for jail time due to previous similar actions.\"]","href_hash":"c18fa5723e6a11ecb5c68bf913550279"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c18fa5723e6a11ecb5c68bf913550279"}},
