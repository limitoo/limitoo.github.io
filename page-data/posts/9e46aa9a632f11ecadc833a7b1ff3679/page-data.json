Next to the front door, a Santa figurine greets visitors and a dog\\u2019s snout peeks through a window, as if an advertisement for domestic bliss.\", \"Except.\", \"This home is in Wilmington, a mostly Latino working-class enclave north of the Port of Los Angeles, where the effects of the supply chain crisis have spilled over in a big way. For the past several months, the street that the house is on has served as a 24-hour thoroughfare for semi trucks headed to and from the port.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s like a highway,\\u201d said Imelda Ulloa, who has lived in this home for more than 20 years.\", \"Ulloa, 57, can\\u2019t open her windows anymore because of how much noise and dust flood in. She doesn\\u2019t invite guests over to barbecue because the din of engines drowns out their conversations. Her grandson isn\\u2019t allowed to play out front because it\\u2019s too dangerous.\", \"One afternoon last week, I stood on Ulloa\\u2019s stoop and counted: In 10 minutes, 44 trucks drove by, inches from her front gate.\", \"Police and city officials ramped up ticketing of trucks in Wilmington after an increase in complaints from residents, but the sheer volume of vehicles makes it difficult to eliminate the problem.\", \"\\u201cObviously clearing out the ship backlog is going to be No. 1,\\u201d said Jacob Haik, deputy chief of staff for Councilman Joe Buscaino, who represents the Harbor neighborhood.\", \"As with many consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, the disruption in the supply chain has revealed something that has always been true, said Manuel Pastor, a sociology professor at the University of Southern California: A small group of people pay a high price for what we view as quick and easy access to goods.\", \"So much of the discussion around the port backlog \\u201chas focused on \\u2018How do we maximize the throughput?\\u2019\\u201d Pastor told me. \\u201cBut the throughput is through someone\\u2019s neighborhood.\\u201d\", \"Wilmington residents are accustomed to dealing with the effects of living just a few miles from North America\\u2019s largest port, which handles a big percentage of the shipping containers entering the United States by sea.\", \"But the few trucks that drove in front of Ulloa\\u2019s home on Drumm Avenue when her children were growing up didn\\u2019t stop them from playing tag with neighbors or skateboarding in the street.\", \"Such activities would be impossible now. Trucks are regularly stalled outside her house, forming a colorful chain that extends tens deep.\", \"As we sat last week in her living room, decorated with family pictures and bouquets of flowers, Ulloa and I were interrupted by a near-constant roaring of engines and honking even though the windows and doors had been shut.\", \"It isn\\u2019t just Drumm. Elsewhere in Wilmington, residents have put up homemade barricades to protect their children from trucks. Roads have been damaged because they weren\\u2019t built to withstand throngs of heavy vehicles. In October, a container fell off a truck and crushed a parked car.\", \"Wilmington, which is home to about 50,000 people, already has high levels of pollution from nearby oil fields and suffers some of the state\\u2019s highest rates of cancer and asthma. This latest development is unlikely to help.\", \"Ulloa used to clean her patio and car once every two weeks, but so much grime accumulates now that she rinses them twice a week.\", \"\\u201cYou wash your car in the morning and it\\u2019s dirty in the afternoon,\\u201d she told me.\", \"Other residents say their commutes have grown because it takes so long to merge in and out of the traffic outside their homes. Drivers delivering takeout meals or packages have to park down the street because there\\u2019s no way to pull into the driveways.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re living in a port \\u2014 that\\u2019s what it feels like,\\u201d said Cesar Vigil, who lives next door to Ulloa. He acknowledged that the port plays a vital function: \\u201cBut at what cost?\\u201d\", \"In general, semi trucks aren\\u2019t supposed to drive on residential roads unless it\\u2019s the only way to reach their destinations, officials say. But with a record-breaking amount of goods coming into the port, drivers may be taking shortcuts to try to pick up an extra load or could be searching for places to drop off empty containers amid a shortage of storage facilities.\", \"Haik said that trucks in Wilmington must sometimes travel near homes because they are close to businesses. But the police can check whether drivers\\u2019 manifests match the routes they take, he said.\", \"\\u201cThe enforcement is over there,\\u201d he told me. \\u201cEventually we\\u2019re going to catch them.\\u201d\", \"Since September, port police officers have issued 700 moving violations to truck drivers, including for going down roads they weren\\u2019t supposed to, said Sgt. Glenn Twardy of the Los Angeles Port Police. They have also handed out 1,000 citations to trucks parked illegally and impounded 400 chassis that had been left in the streets.\", \"Twardy, who has worked in the area for more than 15 years, said that while some port activity encroaching into Wilmington has always been unavoidable, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never seen it this bad.\\u201d\", \"According to Ulloa, the traffic in front of her home slows on Sundays but doesn\\u2019t completely stop. Holidays are the only time when the number of trucks passing by drops to maybe one or two, she said.\", \"Thinking about the upcoming reprieve made her almost giddy.\", \"\\u201cI love those days,\\u201d she told me, grinning. \\u201cYou can sit on your patio.
