Navient on Thursday agreed to settle the suit, according to Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who led the suit. Navient will pay $95 million in restitution to student borrowers and $142 million to the attorneys general. It will also cancel $1.7 billion in private loans.\", \"\\\"Navient repeatedly and deliberately put profits ahead of its   borrowers \\u2013 it engaged in deceptive and abusive practices, targeted   students who it knew would struggle to pay loans back, and placed an   unfair burden on people trying to improve their lives through   education,\\\" Shapiro said in a statement.\", \"Navient didn't immediately respond to a request for comment\", \"The suit accused Navient of steering students at for-profit schools into high-priced subprime loans despite knowing that most borrowers wouldn't be able to repay their debt. The AGs' investigation also concluded that Navient discouraged borrowers from enrolling in income-based debt repayment plans, instead putting them in loan forbearance plans that were more expensive.\\u00a0\", \"By doing so, Navient \\\"stopped [borrowers] from paying down the principal on their loan and led many  to accumulate more debt and never-ending interest payments,\\\" Shapiro said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Navient's harmful conduct impacted everyone from students who  enrolled  in colleges and universities immediately after high school to  mid-career  students who dropped out after enrolling in a for-profit  school in the  early to mid-2000s,\\\" the statement said.\", \"About 66,000 borrowers will receive restitution payments from Navient of $260 each.
