They grazed on fields and pastures and drank from streams.\", \"They also evaded numerous attempts to corral them. But they were finally captured last week, the Maryland Department of the Environment said in a statement on Tuesday.\", \"The two zebras had been among the most wanted residents of Prince George\\u2019s County since they escaped with a third zebra from a farm in August.\", \"The third zebra was found dead in a snare trap a month after the escape, the Maryland Natural Resources Police said in October. All three animals had been living on a farm owned by Jerry Lee Holly, 76, in Upper Marlboro, Md., according to the authorities.\", \"The details of the capture and the circumstances of their initial escape were still unclear. But the zebras have now been \\u201creturned to the herd,\\u201d the Department of the Environment said in the statement. The department did not respond to questions on Tuesday.\", \"But what is known is that the monthslong ordeal came to a close on Monday, when the federal Agriculture Department told the Prince George\\u2019s County Animal Services Division, which was handling the case, that the zebras had been returned the previous week, the Department of the Environment said.\", \"Neither the Agriculture Department nor the animal services division was \\u201cinvolved in the direct capture of the zebras,\\u201d the Department of the Environment said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the case.\", \"The animal services division did not respond to emails or phone calls on Tuesday.\", \"The adventures of the wayward zebras drew widespread attention, with their every move documented on social media. The zebras even inspired a parody account on Twitter, @MarylandZebra.\", \"\\u201cWell, Well, Well \\u2026 they got us,\\u201d the account posted on Tuesday afternoon after news emerged of the zebras\\u2019 capture, which was reported by WUSA-TV, a station in Washington, D.C.\", \"Another post that afternoon said, \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t over @LarryHogan,\\u201d referring to the governor of Maryland.\", \"It is not clear what is next for the zebras or their herd on Mr. Holly\\u2019s farm.\", \"While their compatriots were on the loose, a zebra was found dead inside Mr. Holly\\u2019s enclosure, the authorities said in October.\", \"He was charged with three counts of animal cruelty, each of which carries a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail and a fine of up to $1,000, county prosecutors said in a charging document in October. The authorities accused Mr. Holly of failing to provide a zebra with food and proper shelter, and of depriving a zebra of necessary sustenance and inflicting unnecessary pain.\", \"Mr. Holly could not be reached on Tuesday at several phone numbers listed under his name.\", \"For the captured zebras, gone are the days when they had unfettered access to the state\\u2019s fields, pastures and streams. Unless they escape again, they have ended their run as Maryland\\u2019s favorite fugitives.\", \"As @MarylandZebra put it on Tuesday, \\u201cWe had an amazing time.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9e371bd85d4011ecada08d1a54dd2ca2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9e371bd85d4011ecada08d1a54dd2ca2"}},
