Hulme's debut novel - came about became almost as well-known as the book itself: 17 years in the writing, Hulme told RNZ in 2011 that its long path to publication was testament to her own self-belief.\", \"\\\"The first moment of genesis for The Bone People was actually a short story that I wrote when I was tobacco picking at Motueka and that was back in the late 1960s,\\\" she said, with the final chapter not completed until December 1983.\", \"\\\"It was also evidence of the fact that I really believe in myself and I know what works,\\\" Hulme said.\", \"\\\"There's been a lot of criticism of that particular book inasmuch as I never let an editor near it.\\\"\", \"After famously being passed over by numerous publishers, The Bone People was eventually picked up in 1983 by the small Spiral Collective - a publisher with a focus on female artists and voices.\", \"\\\"I'm delighted, both for family's sake and for Spiral Collective's sake that it actually worked out so extraordinarily well,\\\" Hulme told RNZ.\", \"The novel explores the relationships between three characters: reclusive painter Kerewin Holmes, alcoholic widower Joe Gillayley, and his young mute foster son, Simon.\", \"It won the 1984 New Zealand Book award for fiction, the Pegasus prize for M\\u0101ori literature, and in 1985 the ultimate accolade - the Booker Prize in Britain.\", \"The Booker website describes the book as focusing on the \\\"mysterious relationships between three unorthodox outsiders of mixed M\\u0101ori and European heritage\\\".\", \"Hulme said she was driven, in the novel, to address the impact of violence on both the victims and on those meting it out.\", \"\\\"It seemed to me that in some New Zealand works I'd read, violence ... by men, to women and children was just skated over, it was, you know, a thing that happened 'ho, ho, ho'.\", \"\\\"I wanted, if I could, to show it wasn't only dreadful to the victims of violence, it did horrible and corrupting things to those who perpetrated it.\\\"\", \"She said she had also received some criticism for portraying herself as a M\\u0101ori author, but made no apologies for that, noting the importance of both her M\\u0101ori and her European roots in her writing.\", \"\\\"There's a couple of places in The Bone People where I make very definite recognition of all strands of my whakapapa.\\\"\", \"In addition to the Booker prize, various of Hulme's works were honoured with the Katherine Mansfield Memorial award, for a short story in 1975, the M\\u0101ori Trust Fund prize in 1978, the New Zealand writing bursary in 1984, and the Chianti Ruffino Antico Fattor award in 1987.\", \"For many years Hulme led a solitary life in the tiny West Coast township of \\u014ck\\u0101rito, where she was a devotee of whitebaiting and pipe-smoking.\", \"She had more recently moved to Waimate in Canterbury and was living there when she passed away.\"]","href_hash":"6a7a7b4a67aa11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6a7a7b4a67aa11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
