Final exams scheduled for this week have been switched to an online format. Fitness centers and gyms were closed, and athletic events set for Sunday have been canceled. Most visitors were barred from campus, but offices and labs will remain open.\", \"\\u201cIt is obviously extremely dispiriting to have to take these steps,\\u201d Martha E. Pollack, the university\\u2019s president, wrote in a statement. \\u201cHowever, since the start of the pandemic, our commitment has been to follow the science and do all we can to protect the health of our faculty, staff and students.\\u201d\", \"The moves come less than a week before the university\\u2019s winter break, when many students and staff members travel for the holidays. Cornell students who have tested negative within the past 48 hours are permitted to leave campus. School leaders encouraged them to get tested again once they get home, and to quarantine until they know the results.\", \"No infected students at Cornell have experienced severe illness, Ms. Pollack wrote, but \\u201cthe point is that higher transmissibility leads to exponential growth.\\u201d She added that it was \\u201cimperative not to let such infections run unchecked, but to take steps that limit transmission.\\u201d\", \"The Omicron variant of the coronavirus, first identified in southern Africa, appears to spread more rapidly than the Delta variant, even among vaccinated people. An early South African study found that Omicron may be less likely than Delta to cause hospitalizations. Pfizer said Wednesday that its boosters protect against the variant.\", \"Ninety-seven percent of Cornell\\u2019s population is fully vaccinated, according to the school\\u2019s Covid-19 dashboard.\", \"Other colleges have also taken measures recently to head off the spread of the virus on campus.\", \"Last week, Middlebury College in Vermont moved to remote instruction for the rest of the semester. DePaul University in Chicago and Southern New Hampshire University each said this month that they would switch to all remote instruction, at least for a time, when classes resume in January.\"]","href_hash":"93fd98105d1611ecb9897b1e6e745194"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"93fd98105d1611ecb9897b1e6e745194"}},
