Jaslyn Adams' mother has demanded an apology. AP reported that a coalition of community groups are calling for him to resign, protesting at the McDonald's where Adams was killed.\", \"\\\"This is a deplorable message, and one that is completely unacceptable for the CEO of a powerful multinational corporation \\u2014 let alone a corporation that markets aggressively to communities of color and publicly proclaims that 'Black lives matter' \\u2014 to espouse,\\\" U.S. Representative Bobby Rush of Illinois said in a statement Wednesday.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931558/chris-kempczinski-mcdonalds-ceo.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski faced increasing criticism Thursday, including more calls for resignation, following texts messages he sent to Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot in which he seemed to blame the gun-violence deaths of two Black and Latino children on their parents.
