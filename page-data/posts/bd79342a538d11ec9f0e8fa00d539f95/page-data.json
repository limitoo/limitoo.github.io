The company and its partners have distributed more than two billion doses worldwide.\", \"But reports of the rare side effect \\u2014 an autoimmune response that has led to dangerous and sometimes fatal clotting in a small number of cases \\u2014 were among a series of setbacks that tarnished the shot\\u2019s reputation and caused many European countries to limit its use. It has yet to receive authorization in the United States, although the company has said that it hopes to achieve approval soon.\", \"\\u201cWe hope our findings can be used to better understand the rare side effects of these new vaccines \\u2014 and potentially to design new and improved vaccines to turn the tide on this global pandemic,\\u201d Prof. Alan Parker of Cardiff University\\u2019s School of Medicine, one of the researchers involved in the study, said in a news release.\", \"The findings, which were published on Thursday, in the journal Science Advances. suggest that the problem is linked to the vaccine\\u2019s use of another, harmless virus \\u2014 an adenovirus \\u2014 to deliver a coronavirus gene into human cells, in order to train the immune system to recognize and battle the virus.\", \"The shot is injected into muscle tissue, but the report suggests that if the adenovirus leaks into the bloodstream it can bind to a protein in the blood called platelet factor 4, or PF4, which is involved in the natural clotting process.That process, in turn, could lead to the release of antibodies against the protein, causing platelets to cluster and blood clots to form in very rare cases, the authors of the article said.\", \"\\u201cWith a better understanding of the mechanism by which PF4 and adenoviruses interact there is an opportunity to engineer the capsid, or outer shell of the vaccine, to prevent this interaction occurring,\\u201d Dr. Parker said.\", \"The Johnson & Johnson vaccine also uses an adenovirus, and has also been linked to the rare blood clotting disorder. The Pfizer or Moderna shots are based on a different technology, one that does not involve a helper virus.\", \"Concerns about the rare side effect first emerged in March, causing many European nations began to rethink the vaccine\\u2019s use in some age groups.\", \"The reaction was first discovered by scientists in Germany and Norway, but how or why it took place had remained a mystery.\", \"Public health experts have expressed concern that the rare vaccine-related reactions have fueled hesitancy, particularly in Europe, and continue to emphasize that the AstraZeneca vaccine\\u2019s benefits far outweigh the risks.\", \"In Britain, where the vaccine first went into use in January, the National Health Service reports that \\u201cthe risk of this extremely rare side effect is around 1 in every 100,000 first doses\\u201d whereas the benefit of one dose leads to an 80 percent reduction in deaths. As of Aug. 11, the side effect had been linked to 73 deaths in Britain, according to the country\\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Britain has given more than 25 million first doses of the vaccine.\"]","href_hash":"bd79342a538d11ec9f0e8fa00d539f95"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bd79342a538d11ec9f0e8fa00d539f95"}},
