He faces a maximum of 20 years in prison on the charge, but federal prosecutors are seeking a sentence of 51 months behind bars, the longest requested sentence in a January 6 investigation to date.\", \"Images of a shirtless, spear-carrying Chansley entering the halls of Congress and sitting in the Senate president's chair became iconic representations of the mayhem of January 6, when hundreds of pro-Trump rioters stormed the building and briefly delayed the formal counting of the electoral votes.\", \"Multiple videos and pictures showed the defendant inside and outside the Capitol building, yelling at officers. He made his way into the Senate chamber, where he scrawled, \\\"It's Only A Matter of Time. Justice Is Coming,\\\" on paper covering the desk where Vice President Mike Pence had been presiding over the Senate just minutes before, investigators said.\\u00a0\", \"On January 7, Chansley voluntarily called the FBI and admitted to his role in the attack, surrendering\\u00a0two days later.

My actions were not an attack on this country. That is incorrect.
