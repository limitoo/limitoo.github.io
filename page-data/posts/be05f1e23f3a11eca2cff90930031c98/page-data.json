It will become one of Change.org's most signed petitions if it reaches its goal of 3 million signatures. At its current pace, it's expected to hit that benchmark by early December.\", \"Six smaller petitions on Change.org calling for monthly payments have also grown in support in recent months.\", \"The first smaller petition asks Biden and Democrats to \\\"publicly endorse giving everyone a $2000/month UBI until the crisis is over.\\\" More than 389,700 people have signed the petition since it was launched over a year ago.\", \"The second smaller petition calls for the Biden administration and Congress to immediately deliver \\\"$2,000+ for every American per month.\\\" About 224,390 people have signed the petition as of Saturday. It was initially launched by John Smith with a goal of reaching 50,000 signatures, but Smith amended the benchmark to 300,000 after it quickly gained more support than anticipated.\", \"Created by Tyson Su, a third smaller petition urges the Senate to enact legislation that would provide $2,000 monthly checks for the duration of the pandemic for unemployed individuals and those earning under $130,000 a year. The petition has gained over 181,980 supporters as of Saturday\\u2014just 18,020 short of its 200,000 goal.\", \"A fourth smaller petition, launched under the Trump administration during the early stages of the pandemic, calls for the federal government to \\\"fight for monthly payments.\\\" About 74,125 have signed the petition as of Saturday\\u2014just 875 short of its goal of 75,000.\", \"A fifth smaller petition asks Biden and Congress to support a group of senators who called for the White House to include further direct payments in the next federal recovery bill. It has gained 61,057 signatures as of Saturday.\", \"In March, Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, and Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, along with a slew of other progressive lawmakers asked Biden to support recurring stimulus checks in a letter.\", \"Over 80 congressional Democrats and more than 150 economists\\u2014including Jason Furman, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under the Obama administration\\u2014have all backed further stimulus payments this year.\", \"Launched by Clayton Morris, a sixth smaller petition calls for the government of the \\\"richest country in the world\\\" to give its citizens $2,000 monthly cash payments until the pandemic ends. It has garnered 31,484 signatures as of Saturday.\", \"Collectively, the seven petitions have drawn over 3,913,400 signatures and continued to receive support over the weekend.\", \"Despite the mounting pressure, the Biden administration has repeatedly ignored calls for further stimulus and signaled that it is no longer a priority, pivoting instead to passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill and larger spending package that's key to the president's domestic agenda, neither of which contain any cash payments.\", \"Congressional lawmakers have also not expressed any intention to include stimulus checks to their fall legislative agenda.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927707/stimulus-check-petition-monthly-2000.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">President Joe Biden listens during a roundtable meeting with Americans who will benefit from the COVID-19 pandemic relief checks that are a part of the American Rescue Plan on March 5, 2021 in Washington, DC.</div>\"]","href_hash":"be05f1e23f3a11eca2cff90930031c98"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"be05f1e23f3a11eca2cff90930031c98"}},
