This is the last thing we could do. There is no other solution if we ever want to get to Europe.\\u201d At least 11 people have died at the border in recent weeks.\", \"Hours later, Belarusian border guards began moving hundreds of migrants from their frozen encampment to the shelter of a nearby warehouse. It was not immediately clear what plans the authorities had for those they were moving, but many feared that the relocation was a prelude to deportation.\", \"Context: Yesterday\\u2019s clash, the worst in a monthslong impasse on the European Union\\u2019s eastern flank, underscored the perils of a standoff between Belarus, a close ally of Russia, and Poland, a member of NATO and the European Union, each determined not to bend.\", \"E.U.-Belarus relations: European officials have called the crisis a \\u201chybrid war\\u201d engineered by Belarus\\u2019s leader, Aleksandr Lukashenko, to pressure the bloc into lifting sanctions on his country. Belarus insists that it is a humanitarian catastrophe created by Europe\\u2019s refusal to accept migrants.\", \"Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant, announced a deal yesterday to allow its promising Covid-19 antiviral treatment to be made and sold inexpensively in 95 developing countries, mostly in Africa and Asia, many of which are lagging in their vaccine rollout. It follows a similar agreement by Merck.\", \"\\u201cThe fact that we now have two manufacturer-anywhere licenses for these two drugs is a big change, and it draws a big contrast with the restrictive licensing so far for vaccines,\\u201d said James Love, who leads Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit organization that researches access to medical products.\", \"Pfizer has applied to the Food and Drug Administration to authorize the pill. The U.S. is planning to pay more than $5 billion for a stockpile, enough for about 10 million courses of treatment, after the company gears up production next year, according to people familiar with the agreement.\", \"Challenges: The impact of the pills from Pfizer and Merck will depend on whether patients have easy access to Covid testing. The treatments must be given within a few days after symptoms start. Experts predict that will be more difficult in countries where people have less reliable access to health care providers.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of Ethiopians belonging to the Tigrayan ethnic group have been rounded up and detained in the capital and beyond in recent weeks. The crackdown comes amid a grisly war between the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, and Tigrayan rebels in the country\\u2019s northernmost region.\", \"Tigrayans had dominated the Ethiopian government and army for decades until Abiy took power in 2018 and sidelined their leaders. But since the war began, the Tigrayans have routed the Ethiopian Army in Tigray and swept south. They recently captured two strategic towns and threatened to advance toward the capital.\", \"The resulting government roundups have swept up anyone of Tigrayan descent, many of whom had no ties to the rebels or even any affinity for them. Among them are older people and mothers. People have been seized off the streets, in their homes and even in workplaces and taken to overcrowded cells in police stations and detention facilities.\", \"Background: The ethnically motivated detentions come amid a significant rise in online hate speech, which is adding fuel to the civil war that is tearing apart Africa\\u2019s second-most- populous nation. Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, who is traveling to Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal this week, has expressed worry that Ethiopia could \\u201cimplode.\\u201d\", \"On social media, Refaat Alareer, a professor at the Islamic University of Gaza, rages against Israel. But in the lecture hall, he studiously analyzes the work of some of the country\\u2019s leading poets \\u2014 and surprises some of his students.\", \"\\u201cMaybe this changed something in my mind about their experience,\\u201d one Palestinian student said of studying Israeli poetry. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like we share things. We relate.\\u201d\", \"A bronze statue of a girl with fists on her hips first appeared a short distance from Wall Street in 2017. Since then, her defiant expression has captured the imagination of women looking for a symbol of economic empowerment, and she became known as \\u201cFearless Girl.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cFearless Girl\\u201d has since 2018 graced the steps of the New York Stock Exchange \\u2014 but she may be facing eviction, Zachary Small reports for The Times, after public officials delayed a hearing on making the bronze a more permanent part of the city\\u2019s landscape. The artwork\\u2019s three-year permit to remain in place will expire on Nov. 29.\", \"\\u201cWe are being left in limbo,\\u201d said Kristen Visbal, the artist who created \\u201cFearless Girl.\\u201d\", \"The 250-pound statue was commissioned by the financial firm State Street Global Advisors to push for more gender diversity in the corporate world. Though thousands of tourists gather every year for selfies with the 4-foot-tall sculpture, detractors have called the work an act of \\u201ccorporate feminism\\u201d and a \\u201cmarketing coup\\u201d for a firm that months later agreed to pay $5 million mostly to settle gender-discrimination claims.\", \"Read more about the uncertain future of \\u201cFearless Girl.\\u201d\", \"This hearty dish is inspired by moussaka, but is simpler to prepare.\", \"\\u201cAmerican Comics\\u201d offers a sweeping history of the medium, from the 19th century to \\u201cMaus.\\u201d\", \"Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak pay tribute to 1970s R&B in their new album, \\u201cAn Evening With Silk Sonic.\\u201d\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: Pants, informally (four letters).\", \"And here is the Spelling Bee.\", \"You can find all our puzzles here.\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing.
