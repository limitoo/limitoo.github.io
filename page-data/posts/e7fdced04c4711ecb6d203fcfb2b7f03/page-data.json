Their fate largely depends on the Mexican government.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-23T10:28:33.000Z","content":"[\"As scientists planned an expedition in Mexico this fall to count one of the world\\u2019s most endangered animals, a shy porpoise called a vaquita, they dreaded the possibility that there would be none left to find. The last survey, in 2019, estimated that only about 10 remained.\", \"At the same time, fishermen in the area were preparing to set out with the illegal nets that scientists say are driving the porpoises to extinction: walls of mesh that hang upright below the surface, up to 20 feet deep and stretching the length of several football fields.\", \"Called gill nets, they trap shrimp and fish. They also entangle vaquitas, drowning the mammals. Researchers say the nets are the only known cause for the species\\u2019 catastrophic decline, but getting rid of them has turned out to be a challenge.\", \"Amid a global biodiversity crisis, with an estimated million species threatened with extinction, the story of the vaquita shows how even obvious solutions \\u2014 in this case, putting a stop to illegal fishing \\u2014 require political will, enforcement and deep engagement with local communities to meet the needs of both people and animals.\", \"\\u201cThe government still hasn\\u2019t given us a solution or an effective way to support our families without going out to fish illegally,\\u201d said Ram\\u00f3n Franco D\\u00edaz, president of a federation of fishing cooperatives in San Felipe, a town alongside the vaquitas\\u2019 habitat. \\u201cThe children need food and clothes.\\u201d\", \"Early results from this year\\u2019s vaquita survey, completed in early November, show that the animals still exist, but on a knife\\u2019s edge. Marine mammal experts say a recovery is possible, but only if their habitat is free of gill nets.\", \"Instead, illegal fishing in the area is widespread and happening in plain view. Even as a team of scientists from Mexico and the United States arrived in San Felipe for this year\\u2019s count, it appeared to continue unabated.\", \"The vaquita population has plummeted from an estimated 600 individuals in 1997 to around 10 in 2019. But examples exist of endangered species climbing back from similarly tiny numbers, and the 2019 survey documented three healthy calves among the remaining porpoises. Since then, at least one vaquita has died in a gill net, according to advocates.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re going extinct because of human activities, even though it could be avoided,\\u201d said Jorge Urb\\u00e1n Ram\\u00edrez, a biologist who runs the marine mammal research program at the Autonomous University of Baja California Sur. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not a priority.\\u201d\", \"To protect vaquitas, a Mexican government order prohibits gill nets in much of the upper Gulf of California, the only place where the mammals live. Another bans all fishing in a far smaller section of the gulf, officially called the zero-tolerance area, where they\\u2019ve been spotted in recent years.\", \"But in San Felipe, it\\u2019s as if the rules don\\u2019t exist.\", \"This fall, fishing boats openly carrying gill nets were waved into the gulf by members of the Mexican Navy. On Nov. 3, scientists counted 117 fishing boats in the off-limits area in a single day, according to a report obtained by The New York Times.\", \"Referring to the zero-tolerance area, which covers about 7 miles by 15 miles, the text of the order \\u201cprohibits the navigation of any type of vessel within this zone, except for surveillance, investigation or net-recovery boats.\\u201d It also states that \\u201cfishing of any kind is prohibited.\\u201d\", \"Jonathan White, a conservationist who raised money to help fund the survey project, was aboard one of the vessels for part of the research period. On two different days in October, he said, he counted more than 65 fishing boats, the number designated to trigger the highest level of crackdown, in the zero-tolerance area. Instead, he saw no enforcement at all. \\u201cIt\\u2019s so egregious,\\u201d Mr. White said.\", \"Similarly, on that day in early November when scientists counted more than 100 boats in the zero-tolerance area, there was no sign of enforcement, according to the scientists\\u2019 report.\", \"Asked about the apparent lack of action, the chief of public affairs for the navy, Rear Adm. Jos\\u00e9 H. Orozco Tocaven, said officers were adapting the rule to the social needs on the ground, effectively allowing the presence of up to 65 boats in the zero-tolerance area. They had never seen more than that, he said. But he acknowledged the overall lack of enforcement. \\u201cWe are trying to avoid confrontation,\\u201d the admiral said, citing previous riots and unrest.\", \"Over the past decade, demand for a large fish called the totoaba has made the situation particularly volatile. All fishing for totoaba, which is also endangered, is illegal. But its swim bladder commands high prices in China for perceived health benefits, and the trade has attracted organized crime. While many local fishermen steer clear of totoaba, the temptation for big money is strong.\", \"On Sunday, the authorities arrested six people in connection with tototaba trafficking.\", \"All gill nets are dangerous for vaquita, scientists say, but the ones used for totoaba are particularly lethal because the two species are about the same size.\", \"With the permission of the Mexican authorities, two advocacy groups, the Whale Museum and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, used to patrol the gulf to remove unattended gill nets. This infuriated fishermen, who often take out loans to buy the gear. In recent years, confrontations became increasingly violent, with fishermen swarming the larger ships at sea and sometimes shooting at them.\", \"A fisherman died after his small boat collided with a Sea Shepherd vessel in one such episode in December. A group led by totoaba fishermen rioted, according to Admiral Orozco and advocates, burning a high-speed navy interceptor boat, another boat and some vehicles. Now the conservation groups are no longer allowed to remove nets, only to report them.\", \"Rodrigo L\\u00f3pez Olivo, who uses gill nets to catch shrimp and other legal species, recalled seeing vaquitas a handful of times over his 20 years on the gulf. He found the porpoises beautiful, he said. But he doesn\\u2019t see a future for them.\", \"\\u201cHow are you going to let a town die to care for six animals?\\u201d Mr. L\\u00f3pez asked.\", \"Autopsies have shown that vaquitas found dead in the gulf tend to be fat and healthy, except for the foam in their lungs that reveals their cause of death: drowning.\", \"In 2017, scientists tried to bring some into captivity, but they abandoned the effort when the porpoises became so stressed by contact with humans that one died.\", \"Barbara Taylor, a biologist with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries who has worked on vaquita conservation for decades, said the few remaining porpoises may have a predilection for avoiding nets. \\u201cThe ones that are out there are survivors,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut you have to give them a fighting chance.\\u201d\", \"Recent studies show that the long-isolated species is naturally resilient to low genetic diversity, meaning that health problems from inbreeding, often a danger in diminished populations, are less of a concern.\", \"The United States has already banned seafood from the Upper Gulf because of the vaquita situation and officials are considering further measures. \\u201cThis is something that we are very serious about,\\u201d said Kelly Milton, the assistant United States trade representative for environment and natural resources. \\u201cLosing the vaquita would be devastating.\\u201d\", \"Shrimp from San Felipe is currently shipped to other Mexican states, though, and some locals say it\\u2019s likely that the catches are getting mixed and the banned shrimp is ending up in the United States anyway.\", \"Over part of the last decade, fishermen received a stipend to stay off the water. But after Mexico\\u2019s current president, Andr\\u00e9s Manuel L\\u00f3pez Obrador, assumed office in 2018, that program ended and the authorities have tolerated gill nets, local fishermen say.\", \"\\u201cThe vaquita\\u2019s demise represents a gross and encompassing failure by the state of Mexico and its institutions,\\u201d said Randall Reeves, chairman of an international scientific panel created by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to assess the global status of whales, dolphins and porpoises.\", \"When asked to comment for this article, Mexican environmental officials said in a statement that \\u201cthe Mexican government emphatically reiterates its desire to care for and preserve the natural biodiversity of our country, and particularly cares for and seeks the conservation of the vaquita.\\u201d At the same time, they said, it was necessary to take into consideration \\u201cthe well-being of fishing communities.\\u201d\", \"However, a small team trying to fish with alternative nets has faced roadblocks. The method catches less, but some fishermen think it could make economic sense if they could sell sustainable shrimp at a premium. No such market has been developed in the area, and this season they have not been able to get permits for the special gear.\", \"Some in the community refuse to give up on a species they see as part of their national heritage. Ismael Angulo, who grew up in a fishing family, remembers a day in 2004 when his father, Leonardo, who died in 2016, brought home a vaquita that he said he had found floating dead in the water.\", \"\\u201cIt was almost like finding a mermaid,\\u201d Mr. Angulo said. His uncles and cousins came over to see the creature and they posed for pictures. Years later, when he saw a debate on social media about whether vaquitas existed at all \\u2014 some locals think they are a myth \\u2014 he posted the photo. Some fishermen got angry with him for supporting the scientists\\u2019 position, he said, but he did not delete the post.\", \"\\u201cAs the son of a fisherman, I want a solution both for the fishermen and for the species,\\u201d Mr. Angulo said.\"]","href_hash":"e7fdced04c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e7fdced04c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}},
