This directive supersedes all other directives.\\\"\", \"\\\"When will Finch be absent?\\\" the newly sentient robot asks his maker, a line with all the shamelessness of a sad-face emoji.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c14a93d548eda81e98be67d6d1f40242\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> \\\"I would say 98 percent of everything that, that robot does is directly lifted from Caleb's performance,\\\" Sapochnik told The Hollywood Reporter.(Supplied: Apple TV+)</div>\", \"Truly, it's a hard heart that won't be warmed (or played for a sap) by this setup, especially as inhabited by two performers \\u2013 national treasure Hanks and Seamus, the real-life rescue dog who plays Goodyear \\u2013 who exude a quality that's increasingly rare among major American movie stars: the charisma to hold an audience by simply existing in the frame. (Considering how many films are succumbing to the ease of computer-generated canines these days, an approach that's not without its charm, Seamus is also becoming something of an anomaly.)\", \"With St Louis threatened by a freak radioactive storm, Finch, Jeff and Goodyear pile into a retrofitted family RV and set out for coastal San Francisco, and the movie becomes a classic American pilgrimage to the mythic West. And given the software giant behind the film, the fantasy might be read as a stand-in for some aspirational big-tech utopia, where the California waters sparkle blue and the air is always clear over Silicon Valley.\", \"Filmed primarily on location in New Mexico, their road trip has all the familiar contours \\u2013 deserts, diners, and existential asides over night-sky campouts \\u2013 while the bonding between man and robot plays like those Terminator 2 scenes in which the pre-teen John Connor schooled his bio-mech babysitter in the meaning of humanity.\", \"Naturally, Jeff is a quick-if-bumbling study, and Jones gives him a modulated, softer voice to match his more fluid body movements, making him seem at times like a bratty, over-eager human teenager. It's pretty funny \\u2013 and more than a little touching \\u2013 watching dog and robot discover a shared camaraderie, both unaware that they may be the forebears of a future civilisation.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/4a8e1236058a99a14097dc716d2eba25\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Seamus, the scruffy terrier who plays Goodyear, was taken in by a Californian shelter in 2018 after being abandoned roadside.(Supplied: Apple TV+)</div>\", \"Directed with clean, unfussy craft by TV pro Miguel Sapochnik (Game of Thrones), from a screenplay by first-timer Craig Luck and veteran producer Ivor Powell (Alien; Blade Runner), Finch feels custom-made for its production company, Amblin Entertainment, the outfit launched back in 1982 by Steven Spielberg's original boy-and-his-'dog' sci-fi, E.T..\", \"And it's a compliment to say that a film about a robot learning human behaviour feels like a simulation of an Amblin tearjerker, as though an especially empathic A.I. had assimilated the key ingredients \\u2013 beloved movie star, endearingly cute sidekicks, universal themes \\u2013 and distilled them to their misty-eyed, emotional essence.\", \"It doesn't hurt, of course, that it stars an actor who had no problem carrying an entire movie opposite a volleyball, or whose rapport with his slobbering canine co-star in Turner and Hooch (1989) remains one of his funniest, and most affecting contributions to the screen.\", \"Sure, it can be a little corny at times, but the movie works because of this, not in spite of it \\u2013 in many ways, the film stumbles toward its 'humanity' in tandem with its awkward robot protagonist, a dynamic that helps goose the sizeable emotional payoff.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/80e1858b086bb9fa0679fd5f9c8e9b43\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> \\\"There's this line, 'Hope is what keeps us alive,' and it felt like we needed to lean into that,\\\"\\u00a0Sapochnik told the Hollywood Reporter.(Supplied: Apple TV+)</div>\", \"That Jeff will acquire a measure of humanity, or at least the ability to mimic it, is a given for this sort of film, where the default mode is technology learning the supposedly more desirable qualities of mankind.
