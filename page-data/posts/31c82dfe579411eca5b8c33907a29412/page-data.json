While it can still be detected as Omicron through genomic testing, studies have found that it is not as easily flagged by routine PCR tests that are used around the world to measure how quickly the virus is spreading, according to the news outlet.\", \"This new version of Omicron was recently discovered among coronavirus genomes from South Africa, Australia and Canada, The Guardian reported. So far, researchers have said it is too early to tell whether the new form of Omicron, identified as BA.2, will spread in the same way as the standard Omicron variant, known as BA.1.\", \"\\\"There are two lineages within Omicron, BA.1 and BA.2 differentiated genetically,\\\" professor Francois Balloux, director of the University College London Genetics Institute, told The Guardian. \\\"The two lineages may behave differently.\\\"\", \"Others told the news outlet that having two versions of a variant in quick succession with shared mutations is \\\"worrying,\\\" or may suggest that public health experts are \\\"missing a big piece of the puzzle.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947015/omicron-pcr-testing.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Researchers have discovered a new version of the Omicron coronavirus variant that is more difficult to detect through PCR testing.
