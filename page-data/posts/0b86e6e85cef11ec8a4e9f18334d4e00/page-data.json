Antibodies are also induced, which help to prevent reinfection, but T-cells work more to prevent any future infection from causing such a severe reaction. They dull the blow, in other words.\", \"Already in Gauteng, experts say the number of new infections appears to have plateaued relative to the still-rapid increase elsewhere in the country, and in other places where it's more recently taken root.\\u00a0\", \"Madhi told CBS News that this trend can be compared to the end of the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"They had like three rough rides of waves, and then there was this population immunity that started to evolve, which probably resulted in the Spanish flu becoming more, sort of endemic.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Madhi believes that South Africa may be experiencing something similar now, though he cautions that it's still early days.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I think we are going into a good space, at least in settings such as South Africa where we have substantial amount of underlying immunity \\u2014 largely driven through natural infection, inadvertently \\u2014 I think, we are in a good space.\\\"\", \"He adds that, of course, there is no predicting what the coronavirus might do next, and what other mutations may arise.\", \"\\\"But for this particular wave, I think we will be in a much better space, and we will experience much fewer hospitalizations, as well as deaths, from COVID-19 compared with what we had experienced in any of the previous three waves.\\\"\", \"Madhi stressed that while previous infection alone, without vaccination, does appear to prompt a strong T-cell response, there's no reason to believe there's any advantage over vaccination \\u2014 and there's every reason for countries to try to avoid the high death rates that come as a side effect of widespread natural immunity.\", \"\\\"Certainly, the vaccine still gives you T-cell immunity,\\\" he said. \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"\\\"This is going to be a true test of the vaccines, at least when it comes to preventing severe disease.\\\" Madhi said. \\\"In many high-income countries, most of the immunity that currently is prevalent is because of vaccine-induced immunity, unlike in South Africa where most of it is probably through natural infection. So, whether the same thing transpires in the U.S. and in the U.K. \\u2014 where you get this uncoupling of infections and severe disease \\u2014 I think that remains to be tested.\\\"\", \"But Madhi said he was \\\"optimistic that we will see the same sort of uncoupling,\\\" with Omicron infections rising steadily but not leading to a corresponding sharp rise in hospitalizations.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Certainly,\\u00ad vaccines are still very much required, and if anything, this hybrid \\u2014 where people have been infected, and then sort of get a boost with the vaccine \\u2014 in a sense, that probably induces even a much more resilient, both an antibody response, as well as a T-cell response.\\\"\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"0b86e6e85cef11ec8a4e9f18334d4e00"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0b86e6e85cef11ec8a4e9f18334d4e00"}},
