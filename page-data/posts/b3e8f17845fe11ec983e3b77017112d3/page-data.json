A diverse group of states and business organizations immediately contested the order and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans issued a stay. The ruling by a three-judge panel on Friday affirmed the stay, turning aside a challenge by the Justice Department.\", \"On \\u201cFox News Sunday,\\u201d Dr. Murthy said that vaccine mandates are well-established and highly successful in achieving more widespread vaccination. Schools, the military and workplaces such as hospitals have long required vaccines. Many companies have leapt ahead of a federal order, he noted, and imposed one on their own employees.\", \"At the heart of the vaccine mandate strategy, he said, is the creation of \\u201csafer workplaces for workers, for customers and to increase vaccination rates overall, because that\\u2019s ultimately how we\\u2019re going to end this pandemic.\\u201d\", \"But Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, one of the plaintiffs that challenged the mandate, said on the same news program that the ruling was a victory against the Biden administration\\u2019s attempt at what he has called \\u201cbullying\\u201d of businesses. Texas employers, he has stated, should be allowed to make their own decisions about the vaccine.\", \"Chris Wallace, the host of the program, pointed out that Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas has banned businesses from ordering vaccine mandates. He asked Mr. Paxton to address the seeming incompatibility between his attack on the federal mandate and his support of the state ban of individual employers\\u2019 vaccine mandates.\", \"Mr. Paxton refused to say whether he thought that, unlike the federal government, a state had the right to tell a private business what to do. He replied: \\u201cThe federal government has limited authority.\\u201d\", \"He continued: \\u201cStates have a lot of authority to deal with what\\u2019s going on in their states.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b3e8f17845fe11ec983e3b77017112d3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b3e8f17845fe11ec983e3b77017112d3"}},
