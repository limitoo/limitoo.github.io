departments hit record performance lows at the height of this year's Delta outbreak.\", \"The peak association for paramedics said the record low results were\\u00a0inadequate for a first world country and the public should be worried about the system's ability to respond to their needs.\", \"The latest quarterly report from the\\u00a0Bureau of Health Information (BHI) covers July to September 2021 which was the height of the Delta outbreak which killed\\u00a0more than 500 people in NSW.\", \"Surprisingly, hospitals and paramedics saw fewer patients compared to\\u00a0the record highs in the preceding quarter but the number of life threatening cases was the highest of any period since records began in 2010.\", \"Patients with\\u00a0life threatening conditions had the longest waits for an ambulance, with a median 8.8 minute response time \\u2014the longest on record.\", \"Only 60.4 per cent of critical patients were attended to within the 10-minute target.\", \"<img

to queue at Westmead Hospital for hours.(Supplied: Australian Paramedics Association)</div>\", \"The Australian Paramedics Association president Chris Kastelan told the ABC the results illustrated just how stretched paramedics in Australia's most populated state\\u00a0were.\", \"\\\"It's unacceptable in the first world to be running so poorly,\\\"\\u00a0he said.\", \"\\\"There are some real concerns for us going forward.\\\"\", \"Mr Kastelan, who has been a NSW paramedic for 24 years, said the results were\\u00a0just the latest in a long history of poor results for NSW Ambulance as a result of understaffing.\", \"\\\"New South Wales is running much lower paramedic crewing numbers than every other state on the eastern seaboard\\u00a0... we really need an extra 1,500 paramedics in the system.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b52de3c089a6edde696a41360b676008\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Australian Paramedics Association president\\u00a0Chris Kastelan\\u00a0says crews are fatigued and need proper resourcing.(Facebook: Australian Paramedics Association NSW)</div>\", \"BHI senior director Hillary Rowell said at the heart of the Delta outbreak there was a sharp increase in the number of 'lights and siren' cases ambulances were being called to.\", \"\\\"If you take just one week in early September, these kinds of responses peaked at over 9,000, which is up 25 per cent on the same week two years ago.\\\"\", \"During the Delta outbreak there was severe 'ramping'\\u00a0which saw paramedics waiting with COVID patients outside Sydney's major hospitals for hours on end until there was a bed free.\", \"For only the second time in history a \\\"status three alert\\\" was issued in August which means the service is unable to keep up with patient demand.\", \"On August 27\\u00a0it took paramedics 25 minutes to respond to an 18-year-old who was having a heart attack.\", \"Mr Kastelan said he was aware of a case when an ambulance had a 70-minute round trip from Bateau Bay on the Central Coast to a patient in Granville in Sydney's west.\", \"\\\"And we're not completely satisfied that the lessons have been learnt ... workers are still doing 1-\\u00a0hour shifts as a minimum.\\\"\", \"Ms Rowell said\\u00a0this corresponded\\u00a0with the\\u00a0sustained upward trend the bureau\\u00a0had\\u00a0seen in ambulance and emergency department activity over recent years.\", \"Between July and September, more life-threatening cases presented to emergency departments than ever recorded.\", \"And only about 60 per cent of these patients\\u00a0had their treatment begin on time, which was\\u00a0again a new record low.\", \"At the time Health Minister Brad Hazzard was emphasising that the hospital system was still performing well and coping under the pressure of COVID.\", \"The BHI found the number of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 peaked on\\u00a0September 20 at 1,266 people and the number of patients in the intensive care unit reached a high of 244 on the same day.\", \"Compare this to yesterday when there were 168 people in hospital with COVID and\\u00a021 in ICU.\", \"The non-urgent elective surgery ban for Sydney hospitals from\\u00a0early August meant the state's waiting list blew out during the Delta outbreak\\u00a0but remained below the mid-2020 record.\", \"Out of the 85,296 patients, 6,611 waited longer than the clinically recommended time frame for their surgery to be completed, which was up from 2,108 at the end of June 2021.\", \"\\\"While the suspension of non-urgent elective surgery in Sydney hospitals from early August meant fewer of these surgeries were performed than the preceding quarter, they remained above the levels seen during the first wave of the pandemic,\\\"\\u00a0BHI chief executive\\u00a0Diane Watson said.\", \"NSW Health's Susan Pearce, said while the Delta outbreak began in mid-June, its impact on the health system was at its peak during the three months of the BHI report.\", \"\\\"Even in the face of a global pandemic, staff have remained dedicated to providing high-quality care and doing everything in their power to save lives. We owe them all a debt of gratitude,\\\" Ms Pearce said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/72f313d9f7f5c33fbe32f5bf4d22d280\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Why we hear about some COVID-19 variants more than others</div>\"]","href_hash":"ecb38feb5d1211ecabb083ece0688190"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ecb38feb5d1211ecabb083ece0688190"}},
