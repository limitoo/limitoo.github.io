Her immersion began at home with breakfast: If she woke early, she received Schokolade mit Schlag (hot chocolate with whipped cream), and if she slept late she got Schokolade ohne Schlag (no whipped cream). After moving back to the United States not long after, she studied French, Latin and Italian. A lifetime of work as a translator (and novelist and short story writer and essayist) has followed.\", \"Her new book, \\u201cEssays Two,\\u201d is organized around translation. As Davis points out in a preface, the book is more focused in its material than was her previous collection, \\u201cEssays One.\\u201d With \\u201cTwo,\\u201d it helps to have a pre-existing interest in translation, or at least a general curiosity about language, whereas to enjoy the earlier collection you needed only a pre-existing interest in \\u201cstuff.\\u201d But whatever the topic, Davis is always superb company: erudite, adventurous, surprising.\", \"In addition to translating Proust and Flaubert, she has tackled \\u201cbooks of all degrees of excellence and nonexcellence, of interest and no interest\\u201d \\u2014 among them a sentimental biography of Marie Curie, art catalogs, travel essays and histories of China. Whatever the source, Davis finds innumerable joys in its conversion. The first essay here enumerates 21 of these pleasures. Translation, she notes, puts a person in intimate communion with an author, removes the anxiety of invention that attends most writing work and presents eternal (but often solvable) riddles. It also offers a form of hard-core armchair travel: To puzzle through \\u201cMadame Bovary\\u201d is to shoot through a wormhole from America of the 21st century into France of the 19th.\", \"In an essay about translating Proust\\u2019s letters, Davis voyages to the apartment where he wrote much of \\u201cIn Search of Lost Time.\\u201d The apartment has not been maintained as Proust left it, with his furniture and artifacts intact, but has instead become the location of a bank. Davis receives a tour of the writer\\u2019s former apartment from an employee who occasionally has to run off and deal with banking questions. Client meetings are held in Proust\\u2019s bedroom, and the bank\\u2019s waiting room is where the writer once warehoused an unruly pile of inherited possessions. \\u201cAn imaginative financier with a little information might be haunted, sitting next to the lone potted plant, by the lingering ghostly presence of a crowded accumulation of heavy fin de si\\u00e8cle furniture and bric-a-brac, imbued with Proust\\u2019s personal associations,\\u201d Davis writes.\", \"Although she learned German by immersion, Davis\\u2019s preferred method of language acquisition is quite different, and, to an outside observer, demonically challenging: She finds a book published in a language that she does not fully or even partially understand and then tries to figure out what it means.\", \"To improve her Spanish, she digs into a copy of \\u201cLas Aventuras de Tom Sawyer.\\u201d In some cases the decryption proves easy. Words like \\u201cplan\\u201d are the same in English and Spanish. In other cases she inductively reasons the meaning of a word after noticing it in different contexts. Hoja initially stumps her when it pops up in the phrase hoja de papel \\u2014 \\u201choja of paper.\\u201d Later in the book, it occurs in the context of a tree. Finally, Huck wraps a dry hoja around something to make a cigarette, and Davis realizes that only one meaning would work as well with paper as with a tree or a cigarette: \\u201cleaf.\\u201d Of course, it would be possible to solve the hoja enigma in two seconds by plugging the word into Google, but that would destroy the fun.\", \"Norwegian is a tougher case. For this, Davis selects a perversely difficult family saga by the writer Dag Solstad. At 426 pages, the novel consists of \\u201calmost unbroken blocks, with no chapters and few paragraph breaks.\\u201d Davis reads at a snail\\u2019s speed with a sharp pencil in hand, scribbling lists of vocabulary. The word sarkastisk (sarcastic) provides her with a trick for unlocking others: If she mentally replaces the k\\u2019s with c\\u2019s, Davis finds, certain foreign words become more easily deciphered: kusine is now legible as \\u201ccousin,\\u201d and kom as \\u201ccome.\\u201d\", \"Trying to learn a language from scratch by reading a book is like trying to write a complicated cake recipe by sitting and staring at the finished cake for several hundred hours. Is it the most efficient form of pedagogy? No, but Davis extracts endless thrills from the painstaking process. Her essays do a beautiful job of transmitting that satisfaction to the reader, although I was occasionally tempted to exercise my skimming muscles in places where she dove deep into the weeds. Skimming, however, would be the wrong move in a book that contains an incredible amount of life-enhancing morsels, such as the fact that the sound of a sneeze in Norwegian is spelled atsjoo.\", \"In a piece about the French city of Arles, we learn that Arles not only receives the icy northwesterly mistral wind that is rumored to drive people insane, but that there are old diagrams called \\u201cwind roses\\u201d that include up to 32 named winds, each blowing from a specific direction. Unless you are a person whose activities heavily involve wind \\u2014 mariner, surfer, kite enthusiast \\u2014 it is unlikely that you will have considered such nuances of air movement in your daily life. \\u201cNever too soon to start!\\u201d you might think, considering whether you might be able to chart a wind rose tailored to your own neighborhood.\", \"Davis\\u2019s essays are packed with these windows of opportunity to think more deeply \\u2014 or at all \\u2014 about many subjects. Others include paving stones, Gascon folk tales, parataxis, punctuation, cognates, medieval architecture and sheepdogs.\", \"I enjoyed the book\\u2019s plenitude so much that I wasn\\u2019t distracted by its squat physical shape, which is adorable to hold but designed in such a way that the book tries to flip itself shut as you read. No amount of violent spine-cracking would break the object\\u2019s resistance, and around Page 300 I turned a corner and became charmed by its antagonistic construction. I will read you and you will like it, I warned my copy of \\u201cEssays Two.\\u201d And lo, I liked it, too.\"]","href_hash":"ab99adf951c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ab99adf951c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}},
