Particularly in the 18 months leading up to the takeover, the Taliban carried out an assassination campaign against journalists, government and military workers and civil society leaders, though they rarely took responsibility for the deaths.\", \"But the recent summary executions and assassinations have raised new fears because they occurred even in the face of reassurances from senior Taliban leaders that the new government would not seek retribution against members of the former government and military.\", \"Score settling and blood feuds have marked Afghanistan\\u2019s last four decades of conflict, often playing out at the local and familial level.\", \"A Taliban spokesman told The New York Times that some fighters might have taken the law into their own hands to settle old scores, but that the killings and disappearances were not Taliban policy. The spokesman, Inamullah Samangani, said the government was \\u201cseriously investigating\\u201d such incidents to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice.\", \"\\u201cWe are fully committed to the amnesty that we have announced,\\u201d Mr. Samangani said in a phone interview. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have a security system yet in place, and some people are taking advantage of this vacuum, misusing the name of Islamic Emirate, and carrying out such killings.\\u201d\", \"He said: \\u201cRevenge killings aren\\u2019t in the interest of our government. They are harmful to Islamic Emirate\\u2019s reputation at this critical time.\\u201d\", \"The killings raise concerns that Taliban leaders may have little control over lower-rank commanders and foot soldiers, who are believed to be behind most of the forced disappearances and executions.\", \"Among the Afghans whose deaths were documented by Human Rights Watch was a man named Dadullah, who had worked only for a few months as a police officer in Kandahar city, then quit his job and moved to the town of Spin Boldak near the Pakistan border before the Taliban takeover.\", \"Last month, Dadullah returned to Kandahar city. Two men believed to be Taliban members picked him up on Oct. 23, and his body was sent home in an ambulance later that evening.\", \"\\u201cWe took the body to the governor\\u2019s house, but the Taliban would not tell us anything and did not allow us to meet the governor,\\u201d a neighbor told Human Rights Watch.\", \"Since seizing power, government leaders have instructed members of the former security forces to register with local officials and surrender their weapons in exchange for a letter guaranteeing their safety.\", \"But some victims\\u2019 families say the Taliban have used these screening to detain and kill former officials, the report said. Former civil servants in top government posts, such as judges, who did not realize they were required to obtain an amnesty letter have been beaten and detained for not doing so, according to the report.\", \"The report also says the Taliban have carried out searches to find some former security force members, and have threatened and abused their families to try to get them to disclose their hide-outs.\", \"Many of the victims were arrested when the Taliban\\u2019s elite special forces, known as red units, raided their homes in the middle of the night under the pretext of seizing weapons, according to the report. These units led the Taliban\\u2019s most successful operations against coalition and former government forces in recent years.\", \"In September, the killings prompted the Taliban\\u2019s acting defense minister, Mawlawi Muhammad Yaqoub, to issue an admonition to his commanders.\", \"\\u201cIslamic Emirate has announced a general amnesty to all the soldiers and bad people who stood against us, and martyred us and caused suffering to the people,\\u201d he told the Taliban fighters in a voice message distributed by the government. \\u201cOnce they are pardoned, no mujahid has the right to break the amnesty commitment or take revenge.\\u201d\", \"But that seems to have had little effect on the Taliban fighters.\", \"In a recent killing confirmed by The New York Times, Bahauddin Kunduzi, a former intelligence officer, was found dead on Tuesday, two weeks after he went missing in Kunduz city, a hub in Afghanistan\\u2019s north.\", \"Mr. Kunduzi had handed over his weapon and equipment and had received a letter guaranteeing his safety, according to his family. The Taliban even allowed him to continue working at the intelligence agency.\", \"Then one evening, a group of Talibs arrived at the grocery store Mr. Kunduzi had just opened to generate some income since the new government was unable to pay his monthly salary, his relatives said.\", \"\\u201cThey beat him up in the store, then took him,\\u201d one family member said, his voice disappearing into sobs behind the phone. \\u201cThey strangled him, then dumped his body into a ditch.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"731214c8519a11ec86e85f5488cd2ff3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"731214c8519a11ec86e85f5488cd2ff3"}},
