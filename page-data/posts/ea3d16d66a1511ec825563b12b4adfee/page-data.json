They said those facts and additional evidence establish her Colorado citizenship.\", \" A message seeking comment was sent to attorneys for the prince.\", \" Maxwell, 60, was convicted Wednesday of sex trafficking and conspiracy charges after a month-long trial. Her lawyers had argued that she was made a scapegoat by the U.S. government after Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan federal lockup in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\", \" Maxwell was arrested a year later.\", \"In October, British police decided not to take any further action against Andrew after reviewing evidence presented to the New York court by Giuffre.\", \"Mark Stephens, a British lawyer who has followed the case closely, says London police were aware that because it isn't illegal in the U.K. to have sex with a 17-year-old, they would have had to prove that Andrew knew Giuffre was trafficked in order to prosecute the royal. He said the Met's decision shows they apparently didn't believe there was enough evidence to prove that.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"ea3d16d66a1511ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ea3d16d66a1511ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
