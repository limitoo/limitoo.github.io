The men formed a posse that became what has been described as a \\u201clynch mob.\\u201d They stalked Arbery, hunted him down, insisted on detaining him, and then one of the men \\u2014 Travis McMichael \\u2014 blasted him three times with a shotgun.\", \"It was caught on video, ironically by one of the men now convicted of the murder.\", \"The guilty verdicts landed oddly for me. This was the right decision, the way it should have gone. There was an impulse to celebrate the victory, but it felt a bit like celebrating a mother caring for her children or respecting a spouse.\", \"If you are humane, this is what you do, not because there is a need for fanfare, but because it is the right and honorable way to behave.\", \"But that\\u2019s just it: Our justice system is so racially biased, so often allowing vigilantes and police officers to kill Black people with impunity, that simply having the system not perform in that way becomes extraordinary.\", \"I want to applaud possibility.\", \"I want to clap and shout and dance because I need to be assured that while the racism that ails America may be chronic and metastatic, it needn\\u2019t be unfailing and terminal.\", \"I, like many Black people and many people of all races and ethnicities who value justice and equity, needed to be reminded that the lives of Black people are valued in this country \\u2014 at least on occasion.\", \"We have seen so many cases in which those lives appeared not to matter. Trayvon. Tamir. Eric. Breonna. There are so many names over so many years. The drumbeat of injustice is unrelenting. At a certain point, against your own best efforts, your senses begin to grow numb. The spirit and the mind and the body move to protect themselves from the trauma.\", \"You become conditioned to Black pain. You adjust to its ubiquity.\", \"That is not to say that each case doesn\\u2019t destroy a little piece of you, that you don\\u2019t grieve each loss and protest each injustice, but rather that psychic survival becomes an act of self-regulation.\", \"And in that vein, the verdicts in this case are a welcome respite.\", \"That doesn\\u2019t mean that this case wasn\\u2019t without it own issues of inequality and elusive justice.\", \"The police initially did not charge the men and they remained free men for more than two months until the video was made public. The former prosecutor in the case has been indicted on charges that she sought to shield the men from prosecution.\", \"And when the jury was chosen, it was composed of 11 white people and only one person of color.\", \"But in the end, justice still prevailed. The system that has given so many killers of Black men a pass said that in this case, you can\\u2019t hunt and corner a man like an animal and take his life.\", \"Of course none of this will change the fact that Arbery was murdered. Nothing can bring him back. Nothing can ease the ache in his mother\\u2019s heart. But at least the pain was not compounded the way it was in other cases.\", \"I dare not say that this one case teaches us much about the American justice system. I dare not say that it demonstrates a trend or a shift. There is simply too much evidence to the contrary.\", \"I will only say that a shooting star that streaks across the night sky, that disrupts the darkness, is worthy of being noticed and appreciated. It doesn\\u2019t alter the night. It doesn\\u2019t convert it into day. It comes without warning, a phenomenon onto itself, not a herald for others to follow.\", \"That is how I will view the verdict in this case: I will simply appreciate it.\", \"I will pray that it provides hope for the scores of other families out there suffering as Arbery\\u2019s family is, that it is possible that justice will also be achieved in their cases, that at least for a precious few families, the system works in their favor.\", \"Ahmaud Arbery was a person, a man, a human being with a future and a family. With the blasts of a shotgun, his murderers destroyed all that. They stole from him. They stole from the people who loved him. They stole from the world.\", \"Wednesday\\u2019s verdict goes a bit of the way in setting that right.\"]","href_hash":"571c19484d9a11ecb52a0b357ad89ef1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"571c19484d9a11ecb52a0b357ad89ef1"}},
