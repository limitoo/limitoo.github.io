All is known and you will meet your maker courtesy of a noose and a trap door. Treason=DEATH.\\\"\", \"Wright maintains that he was kidding and had no actual intention of harming Lamont or anyone else. The arrest warrant affidavit says that he was upset at an online rumor that said that those affected with COVID-19 were put into nursing homes.\", \"Local news station WVIT reported that Wright admitted to writing the tweet when police spoke to him on October 28. He also allegedly said that he had heard that nursing homes were making money off of people in their facilities dying from COVID-19, citing former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's investigations as evidence.\", \"Newspaper The NewsTimes also reported that it is unknown whether Wright has an attorney. It was also reported that investigators found similar posts made earlier than the October 23 post on his Twitter account.\", \"The Associated Press spoke with Wright in a phone interview. He explained that he meant that Lamont should be charged as a criminal in the justice system for his supposed crimes. If he were to be found guilty, Lamont should receive capital punishment.\", \"\\\"I just said something stupid and it's being blown way, way out of proportion. I had no malicious intent,\\\" said Wright. \\\"I didn't want the governor to die. Does that (the tweet) sound like I'm going to do it? People don't walk around with nooses and a trap door. ... This is an absolute nightmare.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1933589/twitter.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">An Air Force veteran is charged with second-degree threatening after replying to a text by Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont on October 23.

WVIT says that no guns are registered to the Waterford resident.
