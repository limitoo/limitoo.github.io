with a digital avatar concert eventually planned in London.\", \"Agnetha, Bj\\u00f6rn, Benny and Anni-Frid \\u2014\\u00a0forming the acronym ABBA \\u2014\\u00a0have not released any new music since their split in 1982, a year after their last album The Visitors.\", \"Voyage\\u00a0went live at midnight Thursday in various time zones, to the delight of longtime fans worldwide.\", \"\\\"It doesn't sound dated, it doesn't sound 40 years ago,\\\" ABBA fan Emilie De Laere said at a listening party in Stockholm for the Swedish band's much-anticipated release.\", \"After years of speculation and several dropped hints, the group finally announced the reunion and new album in September, and released the singles I Still Have Faith In You\\u00a0and Don't Shut Me Down.\", \"The 10-track Voyage\\u00a0is not all the group will be releasing.\", \"They will also unveil digital avatars \\u2014\\u00a0dubbed ABBAtars\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0at a concert in London in May, resembling their 1979 selves.\", \"The holograms are the product of a years-long project, designed in partnership with a special effects company of Star Wars creator George Lucas.\", \"Repeatedly delayed by technical difficulties, then by the COVID-19 pandemic, they will finally be unveiled in May.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'ABBA sound'</div>\", \"The group initially dreamed up the idea of avatars, and then the music followed suit.\", \"By 2018, ABBA had confirmed rumours of their return to the studio and that at least two new songs were being recorded.\", \"But great pains were taken to keep the music a secret.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/40a30fb1d64204a29872e37437f6efa0\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Voyage will be\\u00a0the band's

Andersson, 74, explained when the album was announced.\", \"He and Bj\\u00f6rn\\u00a0Ulvaeus, 76, have been promoting the album in recent weeks, with 71-year-old Agnetha F\\u00e4ltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, 75, opting to spare themselves from busy promotion schedules.\", \"All promotion was halted for 24 hours this week after two people died at a tribute concert north of Stockholm on Tuesday evening.\", \"In addition to the two songs released in September, a third track from the album was published in October, a modernised version of Just A Notion, originally recorded in 1978 but never before released.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7809ae1631df7594ef5059a1632bcc6a\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> ABBA\\u00a0pose after

escape being compared to hits like Waterloo, Dancing Queen, Mamma Mia, The Winner Takes It All\\u00a0and Money, Money, Money, but the band members are not worried about disappointing fans.\", \"\\\"We don't have to prove anything, what does it matter if people think we were better before?\\\" Andersson told Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter.\", \"To Swedish fan Peter Palmquist at least, the new album has struck just the right note between old and new.\", \"\\\"It's true to ABBA's sound but it's not nostalgic, staying to where they are but to the people that they grown into today,\\\" he said.\", \"According to Jean-Marie Potiez, one of the group's most well-known international experts, age has given some of the singers a new edge.\", \"<img

age, but they have gained in depth and sensitivity.\\\"\", \"\\\"When they sing together, both of them, like on Don't Shut Me Down, it's the ABBA sound.\\\"\", \"Despite two divorces \\u2014\\u00a0Bj\\u00f6rn\\u00a0and Agnetha and Benny and Anni-Frid were both married for several years \\u2014\\u00a0the four have remained good friends.\", \"But Voyage, the band's ninth studio
