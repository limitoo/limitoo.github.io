Because it felt like I'd been handed the keys to the city of me. Because I was able to make sense of so many things that had only ever been confusing to me. Like why I could be so intelligent but struggle to leave any proof,\\\" Gadsby said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I think when I'm performing, I'm trying to connect what's happening deep inside me and the mess and the chaos inside me.

But I've lived my whole life apart. Like, it's where I sort of sit and in the normal flow of life, that's an excruciatingly lonely and isolating place to be, but this sort of reverse engineers-- a comfortable place. It's like, you know, okay, you've got me, I'm different,\\\" she said. \\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"8df63fd2af9411ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8df63fd2af9411ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
