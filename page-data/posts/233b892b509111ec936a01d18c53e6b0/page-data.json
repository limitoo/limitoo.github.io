solution, a\\u00a0think tank says.\", \"The federal government should establish\\u00a0a \\\"social housing future fund\\\" to generate the income needed to construct thousands of social housing dwellings every year, the Grattan Institute said.\", \"If the fund was created with\\u00a0an endowment of $20 billion, it could\\u00a0soon be funding\\u00a0the construction of 3,000 social housing units every\\u00a0year, or double that number if its payments were matched by state government funding.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Why is it necessary?</div>\", \"Australia has failed to build enough social housing in recent decades.\", \"Brendan Coates,\\u00a0the Grattan Institute's director of economic policy, said\\u00a0the facts were alarming.\", \"He said social housing \\u2014\\u00a0where rent\\u00a0was\\u00a0typically capped at 25 per cent of a tenant's income\\u00a0\\u2014could make a huge difference to the lives of vulnerable Australians.\", \"But\\u00a0Australia's stock of social housing, which\\u00a0is currently about 430,000 dwellings, had\\u00a0barely grown in 20 years, even though the country's population had\\u00a0increased dramatically over the same period (by 33 per cent), he said.\", \"In 1991, about 6 per cent of housing in Australia was social housing, but now it is less than 4 per cent.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/17552161f9f03e66705dcce0d9608bb6\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"According to Mr Coates, most tenants stay\\u00a0in social housing for more than five years.\", \"That means\\u00a0there is little \\\"flow\\\" of available social housing stock\\u00a0for people whose lives take a turn for the worse, and more vulnerable Australians are being forced into the private rental market where they have to pay more of their weekly income on housing.\", \"\\\"With fewer low-income Australians owning their home or living in social housing, their housing costs are rising,\\\" Mr Coates said.\", \"Low-income is defined as the poorest 40 per cent by equivalised household disposable income.\", \"\\\"The median low-income social renter pays 24 per cent of their income on rent, compared with 37 per cent for the typical low-income private renter,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"The bottom 20 per cent of households by income now spend 29 per cent of their income on housing on average, up from 22 per cent in 1995.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How would the social housing future fund work?</div>\", \"Mr Coates said the federal government should establish a social housing future fund.\", \"He explained the idea in a short piece called\\u00a0A place to call home: it's time for a Social Housing Future Fund.\", \"He said\\u00a0the fund could make regular capital grants to state governments and community housing providers every year.\", \"If the fund\\u00a0started with an endowment of $20 billion, and had an investment mandate to target real (after-inflation) returns of 4 to 5 per cent, it could deliver 3,000 social housing units a year.\", \"That number\\u00a0assumes capital grants of $300,000 per dwelling to cover the up-front subsidy gap for social housing.\", \"Mr Coates said\\u00a0such a fund would boost social housing with little or no hit to the federal government's budget bottom line.\", \"\\\"Since the initial endowment is an investment, it wouldn't appear on the underlying budget balance,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"The federal government already manages $247.8 billion in assets across six future funds to address long-term problems ranging from covering federal public servants' superannuation entitlements to funding medical research.\\\"\", \"He said capital grants from the fund could be allocated by the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation.\", \"The grants could be awarded via competitive tender, with requirements for dwelling size and location.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How many social housing dwellings could be built?</div>\", \"If the $20 billion fund generated after-inflation returns of 4 to 5 per cent a year, it could generate an annual\\u00a0dividend averaging $900 million.\", \"If the fund was up and running by 2022-23, it could build 24,000 social housing dwellings by 2030, and 54,000 dwellings by 2040.\", \"If future governments chose to top up the fund endowment, it could fund even more social housing.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7f9e4fdd4f5b0121c8796971fd82ad7b\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"Mr Coates said the federal government had\\u00a0been \\\"clear\\\" it regarded\\u00a0social housing as state governments' responsibility.\", \"However, he said the history of Australia's federation showed\\u00a0large social programs, from Medicare to the post-WWII expansion of social housing, only succeeded with federal support.\", \"He said this reflected the reality that Australia's federal government had\\u00a0more powerful revenue-raising abilities: For every $5 in taxes levied in Australia every year, the federal government collected\\u00a0four and the states only one.\", \"Nonetheless, he said, the federal government's frustration with state inaction on social housing was partly justified.\", \"He said in the five years leading into the pandemic, the total stock of social housing increased by just 1,600 homes.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">If\\u00a0state governments matched the funding\\u00a0it would double the\\u00a0housing</div>\", \"Therefore, Mr Coates said, the federal government\\u00a0should require state governments to match federal contributions to new social housing as a condition of any grants being allocated by the fund.\", \"\\\"If matched\\u00a0state funding was forthcoming, the future fund could provide 6,000 social homes a year \\u2014\\u00a0enough to stabilise the social housing share of the total housing stock,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"It would double the total social housing build to 48,000 new homes by 2030, and 108,000 by 2040.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a8dcb470245daeb9c8c3dc6a63b97979\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"However, Mr Coates said a social housing future fund alone would not solve the housing crisis for low-income Australians.\", \"He said even with an extra 108,000 social housing dwellings by 2040, more than two-thirds of low-income Australians would still be in the private rental market.\", \"For that reason, he said\\u00a0the federal government ought to also boost Commonwealth rent assistance by \\\"at least\\\" 40 per cent\\u00a0and\\u00a0index the payment\\u00a0to changes in rents.\", \"That would immediately\\u00a0reduce financial stress for some of Australia's most vulnerable families.\", \"<img

stress and poverty among poorer renters,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"It's well targeted.\\u00a0About 80 per cent of Rent Assistance goes to the poorest fifth of households.\\\"\", \"On Friday, a new report from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI) found between 1.5 million and 2 million Australian renters\\u00a0aged 15 and over were potentially one life shock away from homelessness.\", \"The paper, Estimating the population at-risk of homelessness in small areas,\\u00a0said a person was\\u00a0considered at risk of homelessness if they experienced at least two of the following:\", \"The AHURI said the lack of affordable rental housing for low-income households in Australia \\u2014\\u00a0be it private rental or social housing \\u2014\\u00a0was amplifying various forms of disadvantage.\", \"\\\"There is a need for greater provision of rental housing that is specifically targeted to those on low incomes and/or those at risk of homelessness,\\\" the paper concluded.\"]","href_hash":"233b892b509111ec936a01d18c53e6b0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"233b892b509111ec936a01d18c53e6b0"}},
