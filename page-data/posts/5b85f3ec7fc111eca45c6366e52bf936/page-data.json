But third doses have also been shown to bolster people\\u2019s defenses against severe outcomes from Omicron, even if the overall protection against that variant is weaker.\", \"The latest C.D.C. study also added to the considerable evidence that third doses bolster the defenses of people with stronger immune systems. Three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines were roughly 97 percent effective in preventing hospitalizations in that group, compared with 82 percent effective among two-dose recipients.\", \"But there have been fewer studies on the real-world impact of additional doses in people with weakened immune systems.

Health authorities considered the additional dose for this group an integral part of their primary immunization series, rather than a booster shot.\", \"In October, the C.D.C. said that immunocompromised people could also get a booster shot as soon as early 2022 \\u2014 a fourth dose of vaccine \\u2014 as a way of enhancing or restoring protection. But some of those people have said that pharmacies or hospitals have refused them the additional doses.\", \"For immunocompromised people with a single shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the C.D.C. advises a booster dose of the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech shots.\", \"The new study evaluated roughly 1,100 adults with weakened immune systems and 1,900 other adults. The C.D.C. said that future studies should look at the protection afforded by additional doses against the Omicron variant in immunocompromised people, as well as the durability of that protection.\"]","href_hash":"5b85f3ec7fc111eca45c6366e52bf936"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5b85f3ec7fc111eca45c6366e52bf936"}},
