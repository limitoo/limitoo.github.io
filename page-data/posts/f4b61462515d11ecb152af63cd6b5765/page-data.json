In \\u201cDamn Good Chinese Food,\\u201d his first cookbook, Mr. Cheung is your guide to Chinatown (as he was for Anthony Bourdain) and its vibrant markets. His book outlines equipment and techniques, and gives 50 recipes for dishes from the Chinese American canon, many with refinements. These include pungent sweet and sour pork Peking style; three cups cauliflower, which cleverly swaps out the usual chicken for the vegetable; designer egg drop soup; briny black bean clams; pork belly bao buns; and many, many dumplings, explaining the Chinatown pedigree and his personal take. Be prepared to use MSG; Mr. Cheung makes a cultural argument for it.\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.
