And what he recalled of his experience on Feb. 21, 1965 \\u2014 the day Malcolm X was shot to death \\u2014 supports the alibi of one of the men who was convicted of the killing, Muhammad A. Aziz.\", \"Mr. Aziz was a member of the Harlem mosque of the Nation of Islam who was known at the time of the shooting as Norman 3X Butler. He testified to the jury in 1966 that his legs had been injured the day of the shooting and that he was in such pain that he visited a hospital. He said he never went to the Audubon Ballroom.\", \"Mr. Aziz told the jury that after he returned from the hospital, he was lying on the couch resting with the radio on when he heard a report about Malcolm X being shot. He then called his local mosque. After his call was returned, he said he spoke to a man he referred to as Captain Joseph about the murder.\", \"Fifty-five years later, investigators interviewed J.M., who told them that he had been on \\u201cphone duty\\u201d at the mosque that day and had talked to Mr. Aziz about Malcolm X having been shot.
