But that becomes less important once you\\u2019ve got widespread spread throughout the community. The aim of the public health response shifts towards management.\\u00a0\", \"\\u00a0\\u201cOnce the strategy changes, you move away from needing the most perfect, sensitive test, towards using the one that\\u2019s most practical and applicable.\\u201d\\u00a0\", \"Why were PCR results taking so long?\\u00a0\", \"If you\\u2019ve had to get a PCR test since late January you might\\u2019ve noticed it\\u2019s taken ages to get your result back, five or six days in some cases \\u2013 much slower than it\\u2019s been before.\\u00a0\", \"When Covid-19 was vanishingly rare in the community, laboratories could use a technique called \\u2018pooling\\u2019 to help save time processing PCR tests. \\u00a0\", \"This essentially clumps many tests together and analyses them all at once: if no Covid-19 is detected, we can infer all the tests are negative; if a positive test is returned, each of the swabs will be put through individually to determine which of them is the culprit, as it were. \\u00a0\", \"But Newsroom\\u2019s Sam Sachdeva, who wrote a piece on the topic, says the flood of positive cases means this technique is no longer practical. \\u00a0\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s just not viable to keep doing that: it slows down the process, really, you\\u2019ve got to do each test one-by-one.\\u201d\\u00a0\", \"Elvy says this is an irony of laboratory-analysed PCR tests being our main testing method.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cAs our test numbers go up, our capacity for tests goes down.\\u201d\\u00a0\", \"What if you get a positive test result with a RAT?\\u00a0\", \"The move to phase three means people no longer need to get a PCR test to confirm a positive result from a RAT.\", \"There are also changes to who needs to isolate. Positive cases are required\\u00a0to isolate for 10 days and so are\\u00a0their household contacts. But people who would have previously been considered close contacts, such as a workmate you've spent time in the office with, don\\u2019t have to isolate - they just have to monitor for symptoms and get tested if any develop.\", \"Elvy says household contacts are at the highest risk \\u2013 there's about a 30 percent chance they\\u2019ll end up catching Covid-19 from the person who\\u2019s tested positive. \\u00a0\", \"It\\u2019ll be up to positive cases to let anyone else who might be considered a close contact know. Elvy says those people will then have to make an individual judgment call about whether they too should isolate.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/271518/eight_col_high_RNZ-PIJ-LOGO-Footer.jpg?1629074696\\\" alt=\\\"PIJF\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPIJF \\nPhoto: .\\n</div>\"]","href_hash":"ac3e907698cd11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ac3e907698cd11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
