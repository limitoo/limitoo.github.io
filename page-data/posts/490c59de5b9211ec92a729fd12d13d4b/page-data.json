The data, contained in the latest federal budget papers (Table 11.3) and final budget outcome (Table B.3), covers all federal taxes, including those relating to business and personal income.\", \"<div

\"Experts consulted by Fact Check recommended using tax-to-GDP to assess Dr Chalmer's claim but also cautioned that the measure had its limitations.\", \"Robert\\u00a0Breunig, the director of the Australian National University's Tax and Transfer Policy Institute, noted that if GDP goes up or down while tax remains stable, the rate will fluctuate.\", \"These variations were often due to environmental factors such as changes in resource prices, he said, which were \\\"not a policy variable\\\" and have \\\"nothing to do with which government is in power\\\".\", \"Professor Breunig explained that for a relatively small, open economy such as Australia's, \\\"really, the government's job is more about getting the policy settings right so that our economy responds quickly to the signals we get from overseas\\\" \\u2014 the success of which would be more fairly assessed over several years rather than one or two.\", \"Brendan Coates, director of the Grattan Institute's economic policy program, also said tax-to-GDP was affected by factors generally outside the control of the federal government.\", \"\\\"We saw this during the later years of the Howard government during the mining boom where the total federal tax take, as a share of the economy, really spiked due to a surge in corporate profits from high commodity prices,\\\" he said.\", \"John Freebairn, a professor of economics at the University of Melbourne, added that the introduction of the GST meant data from before and after July 2000 was not strictly comparable.\", \"Among other things, the GST\\u00a0replaced several indirect state taxes, which not only shifted some taxes to the Commonwealth but would have also helped increase GDP over time, Professor Freebairn said.\", \"\\\"In fact, the post-GST period would have pushed up Commonwealth revenue as a share of GDP.\\\"\", \"Further muddying comparisons were fluctuating business cycles and the \\\"automatic stabiliser role of taxes\\\", Professor Freebairn said.\", \"As the Parliamentary Library\\u00a0explains, people pay less tax when the economy slows, which helps to offset falls in aggregate demand\\u00a0and to stabilise GDP.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">So, what does the data show?</div>\", \"The data shows that the Coalition under Mr Howard was the highest-taxing government of the last 30 years, with an average tax-to-GDP ratio of 23.5 per cent.\", \"Over its first four years \\u2014 prior to introducing the GST \\u2014 that rate was 22.5 per cent.\", \"In second place was the current Coalition government, whose average rate was 22.2 per cent (excluding the 2021-22 financial year, for which only estimates are available).\", \"The Hawke-Keating Labor government placed third, with an average rate of 21.8 per cent over its 13 years.\", \"Rounding out the list was the Rudd-Gillard Labor government, with a rate of 20.9 per cent.\", \"For context, Fact Check has also considered which prime ministers were the \\\"highest taxing\\\", finding that four of the top five belonged to the Liberal Party.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What the experts say</div>\", \"Rankings aside, Mr Coates said it was unclear whether a higher or lower tax-to-GDP ratio signified good economic management.\", \"But he said Australians \\\"should probably \\u2026 expect tax-to-GDP to rise in future\\\", given increasing demand for services to support Australia's ageing population, for example.\", \"Professor Freebairn also told Fact Check that the tax-to-GDP figures in themselves revealed little about economic management, and said the question was not just how much tax was being collected but whether it was being spent effectively.\", \"He noted that while on the one hand taxes created some economic disincentives, \\\"if you had no taxes, you'd have no overall legal system \\u2026 no defence, \\u2026 [and] no money spent on equity and redistribution\\\".\", \"Principal researcher: David Campbell\", \"<div
