They are the toughest of a new wave of restrictions across Europe, as governments try to contain near-record numbers of cases.\", \"\\u201cOur task as the federal government is to protect the people of Austria. We are fulfilling this responsibility,\\u201d Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference on Sunday.\", \"The move was described as temporary, but the government did not immediately say how long it would remain in effect.\", \"About 65 percent of Austria\\u2019s 8.9 million people are vaccinated, one of the lowest rates in western Europe, according to the Our World in Data Project at the University of Oxford. Over the past two weeks, average daily cases have risen by 134 percent to nearly 11,000, the highest since the pandemic began.\", \"Mr. Schallenberg said that the vaccination rate was a significant cause of the spike in infections, and added that cases among the vaccinated were decreasing. Since February, unvaccinated people account for 83 percent of symptomatic infections, according to Austrian officials.\", \"Speaking on Monday, Mr. Schallenberg said that there were no immediate plans to expand restrictions for vaccinated people. That ran counter to a suggestion by his health minister, who said that the government might consider a more generalized lockdown, such as closing bars or restaurants.\", \"\\u201cMy aim is very clearly to get the unvaccinated to get themselves vaccinated and not to lock down the vaccinated,\\u201d Mr. Schallenberg told Austria\\u2019s \\u00d61 radio, according to The Associated Press. \\u201cIn the long term, the way out of this vicious circle we are in \\u2014 and it is a vicious circle, we are stumbling from wave to lockdown, and that can\\u2019t carry on ad infinitum \\u2014 is only vaccination.\\u201d\", \"Europe, which threw off lockdowns this summer but has seen vaccination rates level off, is \\u201cback at the epicenter of the pandemic globally,\\u201d Hans Kluge, the regional director for the World Health Organization, said last week. The continent accounted for 59 percent of the world\\u2019s newly reported coronavirus cases last week, and for nearly half the world\\u2019s Covid-related deaths, the organization said.\", \"Over the weekend, the three parties that are set to form the next government in Germany agreed to impose stricter rules against unvaccinated people, including mandating that they obtain a negative coronavirus test before traveling on buses or trains, as infection rates reach new records. Spain\\u2019s Basque region is also expected on Tuesday to announce new restrictions on gatherings in municipalities with the highest infection rates.\", \"But Austria\\u2019s move stands out as among the toughest imposed in Europe or elsewhere in the world, experts said. In Britain, where cases have risen sharply since May, the Conservative lawmaker Oliver Dowden said on Sky News on Monday that the government would not follow Austria\\u2019s lead, saying that \\u201cwe have no plans to have that kind of differentiated approach between\\u201d between those who are vaccinated and those who are not.\", \"Robert West, a professor of health psychology at University College London, said that Austria\\u2019s rules might encourage more people to get vaccinated, but risked eroding trust in the government.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s sort of like jumping in with the nuclear option without having considered the other options,\\u201d he said, adding that it would have been better to address the causes of vaccine skepticism among parts of the Austrian public.\", \"\\u201cI think this is a disaster on all fronts,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"644e53cc463a11ecb5054d6928f9466b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"644e53cc463a11ecb5054d6928f9466b"}},
