Other digital coins including ethereum and ripple also plunged this week, down 13.5% and 9%, respectively.\", \"That's par for the course in the ultra-volatile crypto market, with investors expecting the big swings to continue in 2022.\", \"\\\"It's part of the game,\\\" Ryan Firth, a financial planner with Mercer Street Financial, told CBS MoneyWatch. \\\"You've got to hold on tight and go in with eyes wide open. You could see 80% declines in a matter of a few months.\\\"\", \"For investors, 2021 marked an action-packed year for of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin saw its price top out at $69,000 in November, while ethereum notched a record high of $4,404 in October.\\u00a0\", \"In a sign of crypto's growing importance, a number of major\\u00a0retailers began accepting the currency\\u00a0as payments.
