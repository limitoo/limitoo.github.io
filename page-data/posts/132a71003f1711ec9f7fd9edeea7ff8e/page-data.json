I felt a profound sense of relief as I nabbed slots for my 5- and 8-year-olds, and I wasn\\u2019t the only one. J. David Goodman, The New York Times Houston bureau chief, was on hand at Texas Children\\u2019s Hospital to see some of the first shots doled out to elementary schoolers in the United States. \\u201cThis is the best day ever!\\u201d one child said.\", \"Despite my own eagerness, I do empathize with parents who are hesitant to get their kids vaccinated, and I hope that with a little time to see how this all unfolds, their concerns will be eased: One of the moms I spoke to when I was reporting on vaccine hesitancy back in May told me that, despite her and her teenage daughter\\u2019s reservations, her daughter did ultimately get vaccinated. The teen\\u2019s friends had already received the shot, and she felt that getting vaccinated would allow her greater freedom. As of the end of September, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\\u2019s Covid-19 Vaccine Monitor, \\u201cnearly half\\u201d of parents of vaccine-eligible children 12 and over reported that their child had received at least one shot.\", \"There\\u2019s also going to be a vaccine clinic at my children\\u2019s school, and that may be a key to encouraging families to get their children the shot. In August, KFF\\u2019s Vaccine Monitor also found that for children whose schools encouraged vaccination or provided vaccine information, parents were \\u201cmore likely\\u201d to report that their child had received the vaccine.\", \"Parents of kids under 5 who desperately want their kids to be vaccinated: I hear your frustration, and the wait must seem interminable. But hang in there: It\\u2019s been reported that Pfizer and BioNTech want to have data by the end of the year from their trials for kids 2 to 5.\", \"Also this week: the hell that is the end of daylight saving time. Clocks fall back on Sunday, Nov. 7. Craig Canapari, the director of the Pediatric Sleep Center at Yale-New Haven Children\\u2019s Hospital and the author of \\u201cIt\\u2019s Never Too Late to Sleep Train: The Low-Stress Way to High-Quality Sleep for Babies, Kids, and Parents,\\u201d has evergreen tips for how to make this shift less horrible. And Jane Coaston, who hosts The Times\\u2019s \\u201cThe Argument\\u201d podcast, explores whether we should just do away with daylight saving time entirely \\u2014 Arizona (except for territory of the Navajo Nation) and Hawaii do not observe it.\", \"And speaking of sleep, I\\u2019m working on a future newsletter about why my kids still wake us up constantly in the middle of the night despite being out of the baby and toddler stage. If you\\u2019ve got anecdotes, thoughts, tips or tricks to share, drop me a line here.\", \"P.S. My colleague Shira Ovide, who writes The Times\\u2019s On Tech newsletter, is hosting an event about how we might have healthier conversations online.
