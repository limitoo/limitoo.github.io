The reasons include growing workers' compensation and benefit costs plus steady declines in mail volume, even as it delivers to 1 million additional locations every year.\", \"Postal Service officials have said without congressional action, it would run out of cash by 2024, a frequent warning from the service. It has estimated it will lose $160 billion over the coming decade.\", \"Those pressures have brought the two parties together for a measure aimed at helping the Postal Service, its employees, businesses that use it and disgruntled voters who rely on it for delivery of prescription drugs, checks and other packages. Tuesday's vote was 342-92, a rare show of partisan agreement, with all Democrats and most Republicans backing it.\", \"Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York, the chairwoman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said the Postal Service \\\"provides service to every American, no matter where they live, binding us together in a way no other organization does.\\\"\", \"Representative James Comer of Kentucky, that committee's top Republican, said \\\"the days of letters alone driving Postal Service revenue are not coming back.\\\" The bill, he said, will \\\"help it succeed into the 21st century.\\\"\", \"Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said he expects his chamber to \\\"move quickly\\\" on the measure. The bill has 14 GOP sponsors and, with strong Democratic support expected, seems on track to gain the 60 votes most bills need for Senate passage.\", \"Over the years, some lawmakers have wanted to impose tougher requirements for faster service by the Postal Service, while others have favored privatizing some services. The compromise omits controversial proposals.\", \"There has been talk over the years of reducing deliveries to five days per week, which could save more than $1 billion annually, according to the Government Accountability Office, the accounting agency of Congress. That idea has proven politically toxic and has not been pursued.\", \"The bill would also require the Postal Service to set up an online \\\"dashboard\\\" that would be searchable by zip code to show how long it takes to deliver letters and packages.\", \"The measure is supported by President Biden, the Postal Service, postal worker unions, industries that use the service and others.\", \"Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said the bill would help \\\"provide the American people with the delivery service they expect and deserve.\\\" Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, called the bill \\\"outstanding\\\" in an interview.\", \"One of the bill's few critics was GOP Representative Darrell Issa of California, who said its changes fell short.\", \"\\\"It has failed to make a profit, it has failed the American people, and everyone who has a mailbox knows it,\\\" he said.\", \"The bill would end a requirement that the Postal Service finance, in advance, health care benefits for current and retired workers for the next 75 years. That obligation, which private companies and federal agencies do not face, was imposed in 2006. That ended up being the year that the Postal Service's mail volume peaked and its financial fortunes steadily worsened.\", \"The Postal Service hasn't made those payments since 2012. Overall it faces unpaid obligations of $63 billion, according to its most recent annual report. The bill forgives much of that debt.\", \"Instead of those obligations, the Postal Service would pay current retirees' actual health care costs that aren't covered by Medicare, the federal health insurance program for older people.\", \"The legislation would also require future Postal Service retirees to enroll in Medicare, which only about 3 in 4 do now. The shift would save the Postal Service money by having Medicare cover much of its costs.\", \"Proponents say the changes would save tens of billions of dollars over the next decade.\", \"Criticism of the Postal Service peaked in 2020, when the agency's board of governors picked DeJoy as postmaster general and Democrats accused him of slowing service to undermine the election. DeJoy, a major GOP donor, has proposed a 10-year plan to stabilize the service's finances with steps like additional mail slowdowns, cutting some offices' hours and perhaps higher rates.\", \"The Postal Service had a successful 2021 holiday season, delivering 97% of shipments on time during two weeks in December, according to ShipMatrix, which analyzes shipping package data. In 2020 more than a third of first-class mail was late by Christmas Day.\", \"The Postal Service hit its peak of mail volume in 2006, when it delivered 213 billion pieces of mail. Last year that figure was 129 billion, according to Postal Service figures.\", \"Since the Postal Service has its own finance system, it is not counted as part of the federal budget. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the bill would save the government $1 billion over the next 10 years.\", \"That is largely because retirees' prescription drug expenses under Medicare would be covered by required discounts from pharmaceutical makers.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"c00caea089c611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c00caea089c611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
