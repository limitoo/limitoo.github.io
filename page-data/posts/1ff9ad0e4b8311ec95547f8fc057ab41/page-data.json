Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, Nov. 22-28. Details and times are subject to change.\", \"DANCING WITH THE STARS 8 p.m. on ABC. The contestants on the 30th season of \\u201cDancing With the Stars\\u201d have danced their way through nine emotional weeks. Expect a captivating conclusion with its final four pairings of celebrities and professional dancers: The \\u201cDance Moms\\u201d alum and TikTok star JoJo Siwa with the dancer Jenna Johnson; the N.B.A. player Iman Shumpert with Daniella Karagach; the Peloton star Cody Rigsby with Cheryl Burke; and the TV host Amanda Kloots of CBS\\u2019s \\u201cThe Talk\\u201d with Alan Bersten. The youngest competitor of the season, Siwa, 18, has already made \\u201cDancing With the Stars\\u201d history: she is the first contestant on the show to be in a same-sex pairing. \\u201cI want to be a role model for people who love love,\\u201d Siwa said in an interview with The New York Times in September.\", \"THE RED SHOES (1948) 8 p.m. on TCM. \\u201cThere has never been a picture in which the ballet and its special, magic world have been so beautifully and dreamily presented,\\u201d Bosley Crowther wrote in his Times review of the film in 1948. \\u201cHere is the color and the excitement, the strange intoxication of the dancer\\u2019s life.\\u201d Based on an 1845 Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale of the same name, \\u201cThe Red Shoes\\u201d follows the journey of Vicky (Moira Shearer), a young ballet dancer toeing the line between two passions: true love and becoming a prima ballerina. The film, which won several Oscars, including honors for its art direction and music, glows in Technicolor, an appropriate fit for this whimsical tale of temptation, passion, obsession and sacrifice.\", \"INDEPENDENT LENS: HOME FROM SCHOOL: THE CHILDREN OF CARLISLE 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). The filmmakers Geoffrey O\\u2019Gara and Sophie Barksdale bring to light the stories of Arapaho children who, in the 1800s, were taken from their homes and brought to a federal boarding school in Carlisle, Pa. There, they were stripped of their culture. The filmmakers follow a group of Northern Arapaho tribal members who traveled to the school grounds in 2017 to seek answers for their people, who have spent generations fighting to bring the remains of their lost children home. In July, the children who died at Carlisle Indian Boarding School were laid to rest in their ancestral home land. While many tribes, including the Ute and Navajo, are still uncovering their own truths about similar violent histories, this documentary follows this Arapaho journey in 2017, sharing true accounts of loss, love and healing.\", \"LEADBELLY (1976) 9:45 p.m. on TCM. In this biopic, Gordon Parks, the director of \\u201cShaft\\u201d (1971), explores a true story of Black history and exploitation, one that occurred many years before the fictional private eye John Shaft ran through the streets of Harlem. \\u201cLeadbelly\\u201d follows the life of the titular folk singer (played by Roger E. Mosley), who was known for his mastery of the 12-string guitar \\u2014 and for singing a song for a Texas governor that led to his pardon from prison, or so the story goes. \\u201cHe was always refining his music, which provided the order in a life that was in every other respect chaotic,\\u201d Vincent Canby wrote in his 1976 Times review of the film. (Parks\\u2019s own life was recently examined in the director John Maggio\\u2019s \\u201cA Choice of Weapons: Inspired by Gordon Parks,\\u201d a film that, in its own way, also captures a Black artist\\u2019s journey through America.)\", \"SPACE JAM (1996) 5 p.m. on VH1. Michael Jordan stars alongside Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and the rest of the Looney Tunes entourage in this comedic amalgamation of mid-\\u201990s live action and animation. Classic cartoon shenanigans ensue as Jordan is (literally) sucked into the world of Looney Tunes through a sand trap and called upon by the Tune Squad to help save the day (by playing a basketball game, naturally). The battle royale pins the Nerdlucks, an alien team led by the Tunes\\u2019s arch nemesis, Swackhammer (voiced by Danny DeVito), against Jordan and the Tune Squad. The good guys are assisted by Bill Murray, who looks slightly out of place but very ready to rumble in a Tune Squad jersey. Can the Tune Squad defend their home? Is that all, folks? (The gang reappeared in \\u201cSpace Jam: A New Legacy,\\u201d starring LeBron James, this year.)\", \"BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985) 7:30 p.m. on Syfy. This blast from the past \\u2014 to the future \\u2014 takes us for a ride with the high schooler Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) in his DeLorean turned time machine, built by the witty and unconventional scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). After a shocking encounter in an abandoned mall parking lot, McFly puts the pedal to the time-flying metal. He lands in a 1955 brimming with wiseguys and high school ne\\u2019er-do-wells.\", \"WONDER WOMAN (2017) 7 p.m. on TNT. Patty Jenkins\\u2019s interpretation of \\u201cWonder Woman\\u201d gives the beloved DC Comics warrior an origin story with weight. The soon-to-be superhero, Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), is raised by an all-female warrior clan that is hidden away from humans on a mystical island. Diana, though, has felt a deep connection to the outside world since her youth. The veil between her world and the world of the humans is torn open when a World War I-era plane crashes into the water near the island and Diana saves its pilot, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), from drowning. Afterward, Diana finds herself facing \\u201cthe war to end all wars\\u201d head on.\", \"ALIEN (1979) 9:30 p.m. on TCM. The static of a radio pierces the air. Silence. Crew members exchange glances. Silence. You might know what happens next. This horror-in-space, sci-fi action film has become a classic, and a blueprint for many intergalactic thrillers since. Sigourney Weaver stars as Ellen Ripley, one of seven crew members (not counting Jones the cat) aboard an ill-fated mission.\", \"2021 SOUL TRAIN AWARDS 8 p.m. on BET. Tisha Campbell and Tichina Arnold are set to host this year\\u2019s Soul Train Awards, their fourth time doing so. The show will be making its first appearance in New York City in its 34-year history: Sunday\\u2019s ceremony will be recorded at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. Expect performances from Ari Lennox, Leon Bridges, Maxwell, Lucky Daye, Ashanti and Silk Sonic, Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak\\u2019s retro duo. Nominees up for album of the year include Blxst, Doja Cat, Giv\\u0113on, H.E.R., Wizkid and Jazmine Sullivan (who is also nominated in five other categories). Other top awards to be given on Sunday include honors for the best new artist and the song of the year.\"]","href_hash":"1ff9ad0e4b8311ec95547f8fc057ab41"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1ff9ad0e4b8311ec95547f8fc057ab41"}},
