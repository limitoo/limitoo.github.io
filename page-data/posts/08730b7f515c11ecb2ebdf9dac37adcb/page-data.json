Ducournau's impressive 2007 debut, Raw, dealt with similar themes, depicting a young vegetarian who discovers insatiable cannibal appetites. It was also an improbably delicate and surprisingly insightful coming of age story.\", \"Titane is a much more complex film \\u2013 and more ambitious \\u2014 moving on from the concerns of young adulthood to the anxieties of parenthood and family, while parsing themes of gender and body transformation.\", \"The first murder we see Alexia commit is deceptively straightforward, like an act of vengeance in a rape-revenge movie. It occurs at an auto show where the camera picks her out in a crowded convention hall gyrating suggestively on the bonnet of a car to pounding music. Bouncers warn the mostly male punters that they can look but they can't touch, but it's not enough to dissuade one pest, who lives to regret it.\", \"As vicious as it is, the gory encounter inspires qualified sympathy for Alexia as a woman reacting to a sexual assault; but a bloodier scene later in the film is harder to watch.\", \"After a steamy date turns sour, she slashes and pummels her way through the occupants of a share house \\u2013 unprovoked and without real justification \\u2014 while Ducournau doubles down with the ironic soundtrack choice of Italian pop singer Caterina Caselli's 60s hit Nessuno mi pu\\u00f2 giudicare ('No one can judge me').\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/1d95674a4280444c4373d43f315702b5\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> \\u201cI feel that my film talks about humanity very much ...

She had the right physique and a fascinating face, but also a presence,\\\" Ducournau said in the press notes.(Supplied: Neon/Carole Bethuel)</div>\", \"In the narrative haze between realism and fantasy, Lindon's masterfully shaded performance lends credibility to the desperate scenario, allowing Ducournau to steer her film away from its early focus on sexual desire, towards a multifaceted exploration of identity and belonging.\", \"Alexia ends up living at the station \\u2014 a compound where a dozen or so men live under Vincent's command \\u2014 and she's issued with a fireman's uniform and hat.\", \"It's a charade, but no one seems game to tell Vincent.\", \"Ducournau is sympathetic to his loneliness, exacerbated by the solitude of his rank and the age gap between him and his men. She photographs his muscular body naked, revealing his sagging buttocks covered in small bruises where he injects himself daily with steroids. He can't stop the advance of time, but he tries all the same, and yells his frustration when his body gives out during exercise routines.\", \"Meanwhile, Alexia becomes a prisoner in her own web of deceit and denial.
