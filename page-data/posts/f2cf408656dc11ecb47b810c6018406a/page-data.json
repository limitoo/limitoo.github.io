The initial four-year sentence was quickly reduced to two years, of which she has already served 10 months. But she still faces nine other charges that could keep her locked up for the rest of her life.\", \"The guilty verdict is likely to galvanize a protest movement that has spurred thousands of people to take up arms against the powerful army. While Aung San Suu Kyi remains widely popular, a new democratic movement has emerged that is younger, more progressive, more confrontational and ready to look beyond past leaders.\", \"This new group, known as the National Unity Government, operates underground schools, clinics and hospitals. And although Aung San Suu Kyi is considered one of the group\\u2019s top leaders, it has distanced itself from some of her politics, especially policies concerning ethnic minorities such as Rohingya Muslims.\", \"Crackdown: Protests have not let up since the February coup, and neither has the military response. The junta has killed more than 1,300 people and arrested more than 10,600 others, according to a rights organization.\", \"The Biden administration said it would not send any American government officials to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, making official a long-rumored diplomatic boycott in an effort to pressure China for human rights abuses.\", \"American athletes will still be able to compete in the games, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said, but the U.S. will break from the tradition of using a government delegation to show support for American athletes and the host country. The move was in direct response to China\\u2019s crackdown in Xinjiang \\u2014 where the authorities have rounded up and detained Uyghurs \\u2014 which the U.S. government has called \\u201cgenocide.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis is just an indication that it cannot be business as usual,\\u201d Psaki said. \\u201cThat does not mean that is the end of the concerns we will raise about human rights abuses.\\u201d\", \"Some hawkish members of Congress, including Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, have called for a total boycott of the Beijing Games, but Psaki said that would unfairly penalize athletes. \", \"Next: It appears that the U.S. will move forward with the boycott without other allies. Several European nations have been pressured to take similar steps but have not made a decision on any potential boycott.\", \"Context: The calls for the boycott have only intensified after the disappearance from public life of the tennis star Peng Shuai, who accused a top Communist Party leader of sexual assault.\", \"The Chinese government has embarked on a massive and ambitious campaign to fully vaccinate 160 million of its youngest children by the end of the year.\", \"The first weeks of the campaign, which started in late October, have shown significant strides: About 84 million kids from 3 to 11 years old, roughly half of those eligible, received the first of two shots. (The U.S. vaccinated about 10 percent of 5- to 11-year-olds during the same period.)\", \"The campaign faces significant obstacles, including parental reluctance. The government insists that child inoculations are voluntary, but parents have described coming under pressure to get their children vaccinated.\", \"Context: While the Chinese vaccines are generally considered safe, the country also has a history of administering spoiled shots and guarding any information about negative incidents. In 2013, 17 infants died after receiving a Chinese-made hepatitis B vaccine.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago, appears now to be a timeless region of true wilderness. But its clock is ticking. Climate change all but guarantees an eventual (and probably fairly imminent) collapse of its exceptionally fragile ecosystem. Travelers in upcoming years may worsen the problem \\u2014 or they may be part of the solution.\", \"Prince Norodom Ranariddh of Cambodia, a son and brother of kings who rode a wave of royalist sentiment to briefly serve as co-prime minister until he was ousted in a coup, died at 77.\", \"If the 2020 holiday season was the year to cancel everything, this year\\u2019s is about figuring out how to get our groove back.\", \"We talked to experts about the new rules for hosting a safe and comfortable holiday party. Here\\u2019s what you should consider:\", \"Communication\", \"People have different comfort levels when it comes to Covid. So be direct and clear in your invitation about what yours is.\", \"\\u201cThe best host is the one who provides the most information,\\u201d Mary Giuliani, a caterer in Manhattan, said. \\u201cThe more information the better.\\u201d\", \"If the party is indoors, will the windows be open? If so, remind guests to bring a sweater. If the event will be maskless, let guests know before they arrive. Lay out your vaccination rules, too. If you plan to restrict the invite list to the fully vaccinated, explain how you will enforce the policy.\", \"Room to mingle\", \"Create an environment that feels spacious so guests can spread out. If you have outdoor space, make it accessible, even if the party is largely indoors. If you\\u2019re planning a seated dinner indoors, don\\u2019t overcrowd the tables; and group people based on their households, or seat them near their closest friends, rather than mixing them up.\", \"Looking to make a hit dinner using only one pot? Try this brown-butter orzo with butternut squash.\", \"Five minutes that will make you love the organ.\", \"Robert Gottlieb\\u2019s scrupulous study of Greta Garbo would make a great gift for film buffs. For nonmoving pictures, try these immersive photography books.\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: Energetic spirit (three letters).\", \"And here is today\\u2019s Spelling Bee.\", \"You can find all our puzzles here.\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing. See you next time. \\u2014 Matthew\", \"P.S. Tuesday is the 80th anniversary of Japan\\u2019s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.\", \"The latest episode of \\u201cThe Daily\\u201d is about Jeffrey Epstein\\u2019s associate Ghislaine Maxwell.\", \"You can reach Matthew and the team at briefing@nytimes.com.\"]","href_hash":"f2cf408656dc11ecb47b810c6018406a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f2cf408656dc11ecb47b810c6018406a"}},
