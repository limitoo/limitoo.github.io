islands.","country":"au","create_time":"2021-12-27T10:57:47.000Z","content":"[\"On a dirt path, forked yellow tongue darting from its mouth, a member of the world's largest lizard species lazes on an island in eastern Indonesia's Komodo National Park as tourists snap photos.\", \"About 30 kilometres away on another park island that harbours Komodo dragons, trees have been removed and concrete poured for new tourist facilities that have aroused the ire of residents and environmental activists.\", \"The construction is part of an ambitious Indonesian initiative that has generated tensions between a government that wants to develop natural attractions for luxury tourism and conservationists who fear habitat for the endangered Komodo dragon will be irreparably harmed.\", \"United Nations officials have also voiced concerns about potential tourism impacts on this unique wildlife-rich park.\", \"Encompassing about 2,200 square kilometres of land and marine area, Komodo National Park was established in 1980 to help protect the famed dragons.\", \"The predatory lizards, which can reach a length of 3 metres and weigh more than 135 kilograms, were recently classified as \\\"endangered\\\"\\u00a0on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) list of threatened species.\", \"Indonesia's Ministry of Environment and Forestry estimates around 3,000 Komodo dragons live there, along with\\u00a0dugongs, sea turtles, whales and more than 1,000 species of tropical fish.\", \"Because of its biodiversity and beauty, the park became a UN World Heritage Site in 1991.\", \"It is one of Indonesia's crown jewels for tourism, typically drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world each year.\", \"<img

Park in Indonesia.(Bryan Fry via AP)</div>\", \"For years, the government has been trying to figure out how to best capitalise on the park.\", \"\\\"We are embarking into a new era of tourism in Indonesia based on nature and culture, focusing on sustainability and quality tourism,\\\" Indonesian Minister of Tourism Sandiaga Uno told The Associated Press.\", \"Part of that multi-million-dollar tourism development is a project on Rinca Island, where more than one-third of the park's dragons are estimated to live on generally hot and dry terrain.\", \"The construction includes an expanded ranger station, viewing platform, boat dock, toilets and other infrastructure.\", \"The project worries local environmental activists and residents within park boundaries who say their livelihoods as tour guides, boat drivers and souvenir sellers depend on the draw of the area's natural beauty.\", \"\\\"When we talk about the development in the conservation area, we have to think \\u2026 whether this is a wisely considered economic effect for the local people \\u2014 or the environmental effect,\\\" Gregorius Afioma, a member of the local non-governmental organisation Sun Spirit for Justice and Peace, said.\", \"\\\"The situation now is like collective suicide.\", \"UNESCO \\u2014 the United Nations body that designates World Heritage Site status \\u2014 has also raised concerns about development in the park.\", \"Guy Debonnet, UNESCO's chief of its natural heritage unit, says the body is concerned with the proposals.\", \"\\\"The state party did not inform us, as required by the operational guidelines,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"This is definitely a project of concern because we feel that the impacts on the universal value [of the park]\\u00a0have not been properly evaluated.\\\"\", \"During a meeting in July, UNESCO expressed other concerns, such as the project's reduction of the park's wilderness zone to one-third of the previous area, the addition of tourism concessions within the property, lack of an adequate environmental impact assessment and a target to dramatically increase visitors.\", \"\\\"Third-party information transmitted to the State Party indicates that a target of 500,000 annual visitors for the property has been proposed, which is more than double the pre-COVID-19 pandemic visitor numbers,\\\" a report from the meeting said.\", \"\\\"This raises the question of how this tourism model fits [Indonesia's]\\u00a0vision of moving away from mass tourism to more sustainable approaches.\\\"\", \"At UNESCO's request, the country submitted more information about the project.\", \"But after reviewing it, the UN agency requested in October 2020 that Indonesia not \\\"proceed with any tourism infrastructure project that may affect the Outstanding Universal Value of the property prior to a review of the relevant environmental impact assessment\\\" by the IUCN.\", \"<img

heritage properties.\", \"After multiple attempts to get permission from government authorities, The Associated Press was unable to gain access to the construction site, which has been closed to the public for months.\", \"However, satellite imagery shows construction continued after UNESCO requested the project be paused.\", \"The government has not responded to a request for comment.\", \"As of December 6, UNESCO still had not received the requested revised assessment, Mr Debonnet said.\", \"Some experts fear tourism expansion in the park could lead to disturbance of Komodo dragon habitat.\", \"The predatory lizards, which can reach a length of 3 metres and weigh more than 135 kilograms, were recently classified as 'endangered' on the IUCN list of threatened species.\", \"The organisation cited the impacts of climate change and the deterioration of the dragons' habitat \\u2014 including human encroachment \\u2014 as reasons for the change.\", \"Bryan Fry, an associate professor at the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Queensland, said tourism could \\\"have a big impact, not just from the number of people disturbing the behaviour of the dragons and disturbing their prey, but also how much freshwater is being siphoned off\\\".\", \"The opening date for the new Rinca Island facilities has not been announced.\", \"Mr Debonnet said it is engaged in talks with Indonesian officials to arrange a monitoring mission to assess the impact of ongoing development on the park and review its state of conservation.\", \"World Heritage sites are usually discussed by the UNESCO committee on two-year cycles, however, Komodo National Park will be discussed in 2022, Mr Debonnet said.\", \"\\\"That is kind of an indication that we see there is some
