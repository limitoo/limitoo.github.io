(Norton, 288 pp., $17.95.) This \\u201cdeeply personal project\\u201d probes \\u201cthe meaning of language and family, inheritance and debt,\\u201d as our reviewer, Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim, put it. The title refers to Rotwelsch, a mix of Yiddish, Hebrew and repurposed German that antisemites cited to link Jews and crime (though most of its itinerant speakers were not Jewish and their \\u201csecret code\\u201d was not about crime).\", \"AGAINST THE LOVELESS WORLD, by Susan Abulhawa. (Washington Square Press, 400 pp., $17.) In Abulhawa\\u2019s third novel, a Palestinian woman sentenced to solitary confinement in Israel looks back on a life of sexual promiscuity and abuse, as a refugee who fled to Kuwait, then to Jordan, then back to Palestine.\", \"THE REVOLUTION ACCORDING TO RAYMUNDO MATA, by Gina Apostol. (Soho Press, 360 pp., $17.) Like \\u201cInfinite Jest\\u201d and \\u201cPale Fire,\\u201d Apostol\\u2019s second novel, which was first published in the Philippines in 2009 and won the country\\u2019s National Book Award, \\u201cadopts absurd premises that are treated with graven seriousness by wordplay-obsessed narrators,\\u201d Randy Boyagoda wrote in his review, adding that its \\u201cderanged scholarly contours\\u201d are both \\u201cconfidently obscure\\u201d and \\u201cvery, very funny.\\u201d\", \"WILD THING: The Short, Spellbinding Life of Jimi Hendrix, by Philip Norman. (Liveright, 416 pp., $18.95.) \\u201cSkillfully narrated\\u201d by Norman, also the author of the Beatles book \\u201cShout!,\\u201d the guitar legend\\u2019s life story \\u201cbecomes even more astounding, thanks to an abundance of rich details,\\u201d according to our reviewer, Lauretta Charlton.\", \"THE LAST AMERICAN ARISTOCRAT: The Brilliant Life and Improbable Education of Henry Adams, by David S. Brown. (Scribner, 464 pp., $20.) This \\u201cmarvelous\\u201d biography, in our reviewer Amy S. Greenberg\\u2019s words, \\u201creveals how dynastic burden shaped the personality and career of the brilliant, bitter and thoroughly unlikable man who brought the prominence of the Adams family, and expectations for the endurance of political legacies, to an ignominious end.\\u201d\", \"THIS IS NOT MY MEMOIR, by Andr\\u00e9 Gregory and Todd London. (Picador, 240 pp., $17.) Anyone who has seen \\u201cMy Dinner With Andr\\u00e9,\\u201d our reviewer, Phillip Lopate, observed, will recognize the narrative voice \\u2014 \\u201cpart na\\u00efve seeker, part canny operator\\u201d \\u2014 in this \\u201cengaging, vivacious whatsit,\\u201d spiced with \\u201cwit, self-deprecating humor and shrewd analytical insight.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9b6e26f5492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9b6e26f5492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}},
