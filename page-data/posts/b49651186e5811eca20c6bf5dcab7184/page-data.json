Yet he saw magic in the beach, boardwalk, rides and arcades that had long defined the area.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s something about the salt and the sea air that preserves the body and rots the mind, and creates the bohemian neighborhood I fell in love with the first day I visited,\\u201d he said in an interview last month.\", \"In the years since, Mr. Zigun, a tattooed, top hat-wearing spiritual heir to P.T. Barnum, has thrown himself into restoring the so-called People\\u2019s Playground to its carnivalesque glory, opening a circus sideshow and a museum and, perhaps most notably, creating the annual Mermaid Parade.\", \"Now, though, his four-decade reign as Coney Island\\u2019s unelected mayor is over: The nonprofit group he helped start to carry out his vision fired him amid a squabble over money.\", \"\\u201cHow is your holiday going?\\u201d Mr. Zigun, 68, wrote in a Christmas Day message on Twitter in which he said the organization, Coney Island USA, had fired him effective Dec. 31, changed the locks on its doors, disabled his email account and deleted his profile page from its website.\", \"James Fitzsimmons, Coney Island USA\\u2019s executive director, disputed Mr. Zigun\\u2019s characterization of his departure, saying it was part of a planned transition that Mr. Zigun upended by demanding a pension.\", \"In an interview, Mr. Fitzsimmons said that despite having been offered a severance package for stepping down as the group\\u2019s artistic director, Mr. Zigun was \\u201cconvinced that someone owes him a retirement or, you know, security for the rest of his life.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s just not possible, and he\\u2019s known that for years,\\u201d Mr. Fitzsimmons added.\", \"Mr. Zigun says the severance offer was well short of what he deserved.\", \"\\u201cConey Island is my baby,\\u201d he said, adding that he was showing Coney Island USA \\u201ctough love\\u201d the way a parent would a wayward child.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not unusual for children to argue over the assets of their parents,\\u201d said Mr. Zigun. \\u201cIt happens all the time in real life, and I think we\\u2019re getting a version of that here.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Fitzsimmons summed up the conflict this way: \\u201cImagine a bunch of very smart art school people who have been very stoned for about 40 years who are now trying to argue over business.\\u201d (He included himself in the description.)\", \"The rupture comes during what Mr. Fitzsimmons said had been a \\u201cvery horrible period\\u201d caused by the pandemic.\", \"The Mermaid Parade, which organizers call \\u201cthe nation\\u2019s largest art parade\\u201d and which drew 800,000 people in 2019, went online in 2020. It was shelved entirely last summer, with Surf Avenue serving instead as a vaccination site after the Delta variant of the coronavirus emerged.\", \"As envisioned by Mr. Zigun and his collaborators, the parade, which began in 1983, was a throwback to Coney Island\\u2019s prime as a lure for artists and performers and a summer destination for a public smitten with Ferris wheels, fortune tellers and burlesque shows.\", \"The area first established itself as a populist carnival in the late 1800s and early 1900s, thanks to its early amusement parks \\u2014 Dreamland, Luna and Steeplechase \\u2014 being just a short ride away for the city\\u2019s hardworking hordes.\", \"Over time, Coney Island\\u2019s appeal faded. Luna Park closed in 1946, although the Cyclone and the Wonder Wheel still stood. In the 1950s, as television became more popular, the crowds melted away further. In the mid-1960s, Fred Trump, the former president\\u2019s father, took control of Steeplechase Park with plans to build luxury apartments. He staged a \\u201cfuneral\\u201d where bikini-clad women passed out stones and invited \\u201cmourners\\u201d to hurl them at the park\\u2019s pavilion.\", \"The decline continued in the years that followed.\", \"\\u201cIt was rough, it was burned out, a shell of what it used to be 20 to 30 years prior,\\u201d said Adam Rinn, who grew up in the area and is Mr. Zigun\\u2019s designated successor. (He declined to comment on the conflict between Mr. Zigun and the Coney Island USA board.)\", \"Still, some of the old allure remained, calling out to people like Mr. Rinn. He said he saw his first Coney Island show at 15. It featured Otis Jordan, \\u201cThe World\\u2019s Only Human Cigarette Factory,\\u201d who rolled, lit and smoked a cigarette using only his lips.\", \"\\u201cIt was such a surreal experience,\\u201d said Mr. Rinn, 50, who went to learn how to swallow swords, eat and spit fire, walk on glass, lie on a bed of nails and hammer nails into his face. (\\u201cI guess I\\u2019d be considered a quick learner,\\u201d he said.)\", \"Mr. Zigun links his own Coney Island infatuation in part to his roots in Barnum\\u2019s hometown, Bridgeport, Conn. Arriving in New York after earning a fine arts degree from Yale Drama School, he decided to look for something on the fringe.\", \"\\u201cWhen I finished my fancy education, instead of aspiring to Broadway or a place like La MaMa in the East Village, I had this wacky idea of starting my own theater in Coney Island,\\u201d he said.\", \"The Coney Island Circus Sideshow, which began two years after the Mermaid Parade, features a roster of little people, exceptionally hairy ones and performers like Mr. Rinn who eat fire and swallow swords. There is also a sideshow school that attracts students from across the United States and beyond.\", \"Those who have gotten to know Mr. Zigun, a sometimes prickly character with a flair for promotion (and self-promotion), credit him with breathing new life into the area.\", \"\\u201cHe made it at a time when nobody was investing in Coney Island and created the Coney Island that we know today,\\u201d said Dianna Carlin, who runs the Lola Star boardwalk boutique. \\u201cI mean, what would Coney Island be without a mermaid parade?\\u201d\", \"Bambi the Mermaid Queen feels the same way.\", \"Bambi \\u2014 real name: Andrea Cambridge \\u2014 runs the Burlesque on the Beach show under Mr. Zigun\\u2019s artistic umbrella. She arrived in Coney Island in the early 1990s from Florida.\", \"\\u201cI have, you know, identified as a mermaid my whole life,\\u201d she said in an interview.\", \"Soon she was performing at the Mermaid Parade, where over the course of three years, she met her future husband, got engaged \\u2014 he was dressed as Neptune for the occasion \\u2014 and got married. Mr. Zigun officiated.\", \"\\u201cThe level of passion and exuberance and joy in the parade \\u2014 nothing matches it in my life,\\u201d she said, adding that the event was \\u201cjust about beauty, creativity, love and no real judgments from anyone.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI owe Dick my existence in New York and all my creative outlets,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI owe him, you know, pretty much everything.\\u201d\", \"As for the current rift, Mr. Zigun said the problems began when he turned 60 and asked the Coney Island USA board of directors about a pension. When it was denied, he said, he asserted intellectual property rights over the parade and the sideshow.\", \"\\u201cTheir response was to fire me,\\u201d he said, adding that he \\u201cwould be left destitute\\u201d by the amount of severance he was offered.\", \"\\u201cWhat am I going to do after the money runs out?\\u201d said Mr. Zigun, who was paid $66,528 as artistic director in 2019, according an organization tax filing. \\u201cI wanted to get to a point where when I was elderly, I would be healthy and a wacko, and I\\u2019m pretty much there already.\\u201d\", \"In a statement, Coney Island USA insisted that Mr. Zigun had been offered a \\u201cvery generous severance agreement, which could have led to a more positive departure and recognition of his many contributions.\\u201d\", \"As of Tuesday, it appeared that the parties were trying to negotiate a more amicable resolution. In the meantime, the 40th annual Mermaid Parade is scheduled for June 18. After all, Mr. Rinn said, it is essential to \\u201cthe Coney Island character.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYou know what it is?\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s something about that neighborhood that brings out the fun, the eccentric, the odd, the weird. And the genuine.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b49651186e5811eca20c6bf5dcab7184"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b49651186e5811eca20c6bf5dcab7184"}},
