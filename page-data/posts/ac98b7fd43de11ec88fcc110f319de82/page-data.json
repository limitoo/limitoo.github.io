Stay at home for this year\\u2019s virtual New York City Horror Film Festival (Dec. 2-9) or for this month\\u2019s streaming picks, which include mutants in love and mushrooms out for blood.\", \"Who would have thought my pulse would race watching a guy work on his home computer during the pandemic? That\\u2019s what happened during this taut conspiracy thriller written and directed by Christian Nilsson. (Don\\u2019t confuse it with the other new horror film called \\u201cDashcam.\\u201d)\", \"It\\u2019s Halloween night, and Jake (an intense Eric Tabach) is a video editor working out of his New York City apartment on a local TV news story about a fatal traffic stop that involved a police officer and a former state attorney general. When Jake gets an email from the state\\u2019s press office marked \\u201cConfidential,\\u201d he opens it to find dashcam evidence suggesting that what happened on the road that night might have been an assassination.\", \"The spooked-out Jake, who dreams of being a reporter, leaves his apartment to look for a clue he thinks is hidden in Washington Square Park. But what\\u2019s with the car idling outside his apartment?\", \"Nilsson has cited Francis Ford Coppola\\u2019s \\u201cThe Conversation\\u201d as an inspiration, and it shows. \\u201cDashcam\\u201d is at its creepiest when just audio and video clips, and Jake\\u2019s surgical adjustments to them, steer the paranoia-driven story. Over 82 unnerving minutes, Nilsson squeezes big suspense out of seemingly throwaway moments, as when Jake just sits and listens to audio tracks. The muted underscoring that sounds like it\\u2019s coming from the next apartment adds a sinister sonic edge.\", \"The 2019 documentary \\u201cHorror Noire\\u201d was a past-due, eye-opening look at Black Americans and their place in, and relationships to, horror movies. Using the same title, this anthology highlights Black actors, filmmakers and six macabre tales that include blood suckers, a possessed house and, as one character puts it, \\u201cSatan his damn self.\\u201d\", \"There are two standouts. \\u201cGet Out\\u201d meets \\u201cMidsommar\\u201d in Kimani Ray Smith\\u2019s very funny horror comedy \\u201cSundown.\\u201d Erica Ash and Tone Bell star as a couple whose political canvassing in rural West Virginia gets interrupted one night by local racist vampires.\", \"The other is Julien Christian Lutz\\u2019s \\u201cBrand of Evil.\\u201d It\\u2019s a Faustian story about Nekani, a young gay artist (Brandon Mychal Smith) who starts getting well-paying commissions from a mystery patron. When Nekani learns his client\\u2019s designs are hate symbols, he struggles to reconcile the sinister assignments with the big money they come with. No matter: His fate has been sealed, with soul-sucking consequences.\", \"Jaco Bouwer\\u2019s film is many genres in one: folk horror, eco horror, survival film, creature feature. It\\u2019s also about killer mushrooms.\", \"The film opens as two South African forest rangers, Gabi (Monique Rockman) and Winston (Anthony Oseyemi), paddle down a river. Their overhead surveillance drone crashes, but not before Gabi sees a figure on camera. Entering the forest to investigate, she injures her foot in a trap, yet manages to reach the ramshackle home of the survivalists Barend (Carel Nel) and his son Stefan (Alex van Dyk). Later, after the three beat back a creature that invades the cabin, Gabi realizes that dark supernatural forces are at play in the father and son\\u2019s devotion to Mother Nature.\", \"The film\\u2019s message is a folk horror chestnut: nature is good and technology and the city are bad. What\\u2019s refreshing is the eye-popping cinematography by Jorrie van der Walt, who makes flora \\u2014 the movie was shot in South Africa\\u2019s Garden Route region \\u2014 appear breathtakingly lush.\", \"The film often looks like a fashion commercial \\u2014 wild mushroom spores float like twinkling stars and cute little plants sprout from Gabi\\u2019s body. Don\\u2019t let the beauty deceive you \\u2014 what you\\u2019re watching is a natural world out for blood.\", \"Fraternal twins Spencer (Taylor Turner) and Sarah Moss (Amelia Dudley) check in at a Vermont hotel to investigate the last known whereabouts of their father, who mysteriously disappeared the night they were born. There they meet the oddball night manager (Greg Schweers), who remembers every guest, and Dean (Beau Minniear), the hunky but enigmatic handyman.\", \"The manager claims the inn is full, but as Spencer and Sarah roam the empty halls, nobody else seems to be there. Of course they\\u2019re not alone \\u2014 through a staticky television their father appears with a cryptic message.\", \"Erik Bloomquist\\u2019s low-budget film doesn\\u2019t always land. The bombastic score doesn\\u2019t match the intimate setting. Spencer was so grating I rooted for Satan.\", \"That said, this small, emotionally driven film has real pluck, and in just 70 minutes it offers a macabre deal-with-the-devil spin on the haunted hotel genre. The seemingly living televisions that fuel the story reminded me of the early films of Atom Egoyan and how monitors became portals of family grief.\", \"The police station in a small Polish town has problems on its hands. A few corpses, for starters, but also a jail filled with two grotesque ogres and a young woman, Zosia (Julia Wieniawa-Narkiewicz), who says she\\u2019s the only survivor of a massacre at a nearby camp for teen technology addicts.\", \"An inspector takes Zosia back to the grounds to look around, but they don\\u2019t get far before goo from a meteorite unleashes a brutal force. Zosia turns into a rampaging monster, and the young officers, the neo-Nazi brothers and the prostitute who land in her path don\\u2019t stand a chance.\", \"This gory, slapsticky sequel doesn\\u2019t match the smartly funny take on slasher films that made the fantastical original a treat. (The movies, both in Polish, were directed by Bartosz M. Kowalski.) But when this film takes an unexpected turn in the final stretch with a bizarre human-mutant sexual encounter, it offers an odd but sweet lesson on otherness and understanding.\"]","href_hash":"ac98b7fd43de11ec88fcc110f319de82"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ac98b7fd43de11ec88fcc110f319de82"}},
