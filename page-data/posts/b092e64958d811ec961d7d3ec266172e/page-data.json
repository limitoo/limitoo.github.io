Now, observed Ms. Ahmed, 21, there\\u2019s a differently colored or styled abaya for every occasion: weddings, meeting friends at a cafe, visiting parents.\", \"\\u201cColored abayas used to be a strange thing for us in Riyadh, something unusual,\\u201d said Ms. Ahmed, the store\\u2019s clerk. \\u201cWithin a year it has significantly changed. It has become normal nowadays.\\u201d\", \"Since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman became Saudi Arabia\\u2019s de facto leader more than four years ago, he has promised new opportunities for Saudi women as part of a broad modernization plan called Vision 2030.\", \"The plan, which is advertised across Riyadh on posters and flags, is meant to wean the kingdom away from its historical reliance on oil and shift it toward new industries, including technology, pharmaceuticals and tourism.\", \"But to create more job opportunities for Saudis and draw international investors and corporations to the desert monarchy, Prince Mohammed is also chipping away at the conservative culture that has kept many women close to home for years and scared away many foreigners.\", \"Over the last five years, the percentage of women working outside the home has almost doubled, according to official statistics, to 32 percent from nearly 18 percent. Women today serve as customs officials at the King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, client relationship managers at banks and hostesses at restaurants.\", \"In addition to changes in the workplace, public space is becoming less strictly segregated by sex. In coffee shops in Riyadh like Overdose (motto: \\u201cCaffeine, it\\u2019s my drug of choice\\u201d), male and female customers can now sip lattes in mixed company.\", \"Women can attend certain sporting events at stadiums, which was forbidden until a few years ago. They are no longer required to use separate entrances from men although some establishments still use them. They can also now apply for passports, live by themselves and travel on their own.\", \"But the progress has been uneven.\", \"The guardianship system, which despite some recent reforms is still in place, means that women must rely on permission from men \\u2014 often their fathers or husbands, but in some cases their sons \\u2014 to enter into marriages and make key decisions.\", \"One prominent women\\u2019s rights activist was jailed for three years after pushing publicly for some of the very changes Prince Mohammed wanted to make \\u2014 including allowing women to drive. She has since been released and has published a research paper on the status of Saudi women.\", \"Those fits and starts are also evident in quotidian ways. Women\\u2019s attire in Riyadh, though more relaxed than a few years ago, is still far from liberal; even women who avoid abayas wear clothes with long sleeves, high necklines and low hemlines.\", \"They may be using money from their newly earned paychecks to shop for kitten-heeled boots and slip dresses at Zara, but such outfits are still worn only in private settings.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not like before, like you have to wear, like, hijab and everything,\\u201d said Marwa, a 19-year-old university student who was shopping at Ms. Ahmed\\u2019s shop, referring to the traditional head scarf worn by Saudi women. \\u201cNow you can have free choice, but limited. It\\u2019s not like you are showing parts of your body.\\u201d\", \"However much things have changed, the culture remains sufficiently conservative \\u2014 and cautious of angering the authorities \\u2014 that Marwa, like many of the Riyadh residents interviewed for this article, declined to give her full name.\", \"Marwa said other cultural changes, like allowing store owners to remain open during prayer time to accommodate both merchants and shoppers, created problems of their own.\", \"Some people who are devout and would pray no matter what, she said, could be offended by the business-as-usual attitude. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like you\\u2019re not respecting the prayer time,\\u201d she said. Her friend Alaa \\u2014 who wore sweatpants and sneakers under her abaya and sported a wrist tattoo that said \\u201cTrust no one\\u201d \\u2014 nodded.\", \"During the call to prayer a few minutes later, a number of male store workers nearby locked their doors and walked to the mall\\u2019s prayer room on an upper floor. On the ground floor, about 10 women, patrons who were wearing black abayas and hijabs, took rugs from a corner pile and knelt on them to pray. Other women sat quietly on benches, watching their children ride around in battery-operated toy cars.\", \"A 52-year-old father of six, who gave only a nickname, Abu Abdullah, said he saw the benefits of more flexible prayer times and new opportunities for women. \\u201cDuring traveling, we don\\u2019t pray,\\u201d he said. \\u201cEven women, they don\\u2019t pray for seven days,\\u201d referring to the fact that women are forbidden to pray when they are menstruating.\", \"Several of Abu Abdullah\\u2019s five daughters were standing nearby, eating buttered corn and French fries. One of them, Nout al-Qahtani, 13, said she was thrilled about the changes for women in Saudi Arabia. \\u201cI want to work,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI really want to be a doctor.\\u201d\", \"Her father noted that not every dream job would be appropriate.\", \"\\u201cSome jobs don\\u2019t fit for some women,\\u201d he said, citing roles in plumbing and construction work as examples. \\u201cIt\\u2019s better to put her in the right place,\\u201d he added.\", \"Five miles north of the mall, a local soccer club, Al Shabab, was playing an out-of-town team at Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium. It was a mild evening, and the crowd was animated when the home team scored. On the men\\u2019s side of the stadium, hundreds of men jumped to their feet, chanting and clapping for the players.\", \"Across the stadium on what\\u2019s known as the family side, where women and children were directed to sit, Najiba, a nurse at the hospital complex King Fahd Medical City, was watching with two colleagues. Although women have been able to go to sports events in Saudi since 2018, it was only her second time at a match.\", \"Najiba, 34, and her friends said that they were seeing far more Saudi women working at the hospital in recent years, and that the idea of women in medical careers had become more palatable to families who might previously have considered a mixed-gender working environment problematic.\", \"\\u201cNow the family accepts if they have a daughter or a wife working in health care,\\u201d said Najiba, who was a nurse in a neonatal intensive care unit for years before taking on an administrative role.\", \"Below the nurses, a few children were playing in the front row. One child, who had been running around and yelling, was scolded by a female security guard.\", \"Several female spectators said they never missed a match. One, a 29-year-old manager at the Saudi British Bank attending with her brother, spoke highly of Riyadh\\u2019s new entertainment options and the growing economic opportunities for women. \\u201cWe\\u2019re so excited,\\u201d she said.\", \"A little after 9:30 p.m., the match ended in a 3-0 victory for Al Shabab.\", \"As the crowd dispersed, one of its star players, the midfielder Hattan Bahebri, was signing autographs for dozens of fans through the fence that separated the stands from the field.\", \"At one point, he held his hands in a heart shape in front of him. A clutch of men encircled the player, some with children hoisted on their shoulders. But one woman, her pink-tinted sunglasses atop her hijab, walked to the front of the crowd, raised her phone and got the shot.\"]","href_hash":"b092e64958d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b092e64958d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}},
