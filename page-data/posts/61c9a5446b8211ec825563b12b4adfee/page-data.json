The fight was later ruled a no-contest after Lesnar was found to have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs prior to the bout after receiving exemptions from standard USADA testing protocol in order to compete at the event.\", \"Hunt alleged the UFC manipulated its own drug-testing requirements to allow Lesnar to fight him while using performance-enhancing drugs. He filed a lawsuit claiming fraud, unjust enrichment, breach of contract, battery, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\", \"After these were dismissed by a district court, Hunt secured a legal victory when a higher court reversed some of that decision, allowing his lawsuit's claims of fraud and battery to go back to the district court.\", \"However since the majority of his claims were dismissed, UFC has sought to recover legal fees from Hunt under a clause in his contract allowing the \\\"prevailing party\\\" to recover \\\"its attorneys' fees and costs\\\".\", \"Hunt conceded that the UFC may seek attorneys' fees and costs for defending itself, but argued the decision to seek costs should be delayed due to his ongoing appeal.\", \"A judge disagreed, writing in a just-released decision: \\\"I find that the efficient disposition of this matter is best served by my resolution of UFC's fee motion. So, I deny Hunt's request to defer ruling on UFC's motion until after appeal.\\\"\", \"Hunt has been ordered to pay US$301,792.50 in attorneys' fees and US$86,442.72 in costs, for a total of US$388,235.22 - or NZ$567,429.84.\"]","href_hash":"61c9a5446b8211ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"61c9a5446b8211ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
