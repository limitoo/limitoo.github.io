Preliminary estimates suggested it was three-quarters of a mile in width, according to the NWS. Experts believe the tornado traveled more than 220 miles, which would set a record if verified, Adkins said.\", \"Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said it was \\\"the worst tornado event\\\" in his state's history, with at least 64 deaths confirmed as of Monday. In addition to the long track tornado, at least three others touched down in Kentucky over the weekend, Beshear said.\", \"Long track tornadoes in December are \\\"certainly not unheard of,\\\" Adkins said. Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee are three states in which December or January tornadoes are more common than summertime tornadoes, he said. These wintertime tornadoes occur when jet stream winds that typically blow through the Northern Plains in the summer move south in the fall, providing Southern states with the wind energy needed to create \\\"rotating thunderstorms.\\\"\", \"\\\"Farther south, you're still holding on to some of that summertime moisture, and now you're introducing some stronger jet stream dynamics that come into play,\\\" Adkins said. These were the variables at play when the long track tornado struck late last week, he added.\", \"\\\"I think more people should be aware that severe weather can occur during the wintertime, and for the reasons just mentioned, they can actually be more dangerous during the wintertime,\\\" he said.\"]","href_hash":"ac4f6a535c5211ec86f0c79927e536c4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ac4f6a535c5211ec86f0c79927e536c4"}},
