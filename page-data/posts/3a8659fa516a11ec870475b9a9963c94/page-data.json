The recommendations came in response to growing concerns over the Omicron COVID-19 variant.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Today, I am issuing a Commissioner's Advisory STRONGLY recommending that all New Yorkers wear a mask AT ALL TIMES when indoors and in a public setting \\u2013 like at your grocery, building lobbies, offices, and stores,\\\" health commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi tweeted.\", \"A slide recommending indoor mask wearing was also displayed during a COVID-19 briefing given by Governor Kathy Hochul on Monday.\", \"\\\"Omicron is just across the bridge in Ontario,\\\" Hochul\\u00a0said. \\\"It's not a question of if it comes to New York, but when.\\\" \\u00a0\", \"Chokshi also said that there are currently no confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in New York City. \\\"Delta remains the dominant strain \\u2013 about 98% of sequenced specimens,\\\" he said. \\\"We do anticipate detecting Omicron in the coming days, based on what we know about its global spread.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Officials currently have limited knowledge on the Omicron variant, including whether it is more transmissible or causes more severe illness than other variants.

Until then, let's bring to bear our tried-and-true tools that are already helping us keep COVID-19 at bay.\\\"\", \"The health commissioner also recommended that residents continue to get vaccinated and regularly test for COVID-19, especially before and after holiday travel.\\u00a0\", \"On Friday, Hochul declared a state of emergency as COVID-19 cases in the state have steadily risen over the past few months.
