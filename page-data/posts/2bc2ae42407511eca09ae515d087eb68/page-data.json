Today we\\u2019ll look at rats in New York, which have become a more serious problem than ever. And with the New York Comedy Festival beginning tonight, we will also look at humor at this moment in the pandemic.\", \"Add a plague of rats to everything else New York faces in trying to rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic.\", \"The city\\u2019s 311 line had received more than 21,000 calls about rat sightings through last Wednesday, compared with 15,000 in the same period in 2019. Health inspections to look for indications of \\u201cactive rats\\u201d nearly doubled in the latest fiscal year. There have also been 15 cases this year of leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that can cause serious liver and kidney damage. In the city, it is typically spread through rat urine, according to health officials. One case was fatal.\", \"Rats are a disturbing urban problem, but hardly a new one \\u2014 I have written four articles about rats in the past 14 years, including one about a block on the Upper West Side that put up \\u201crat crossing\\u201d signs after a frustrated resident saw what he called a late-night rodent \\u201cconga line.\\u201d But as my colleague Ed Shanahan writes, the current surge followed a perfect-pandemic-storm scenario that goes like this:\", \"When restaurants closed, rats had to scavenge outside more. They found gutters and street-corner baskets clogged with trash because of cuts in the Sanitation Department budget. Illegal dumping increased. With most people stuck at home, so did residential waste.\", \"A few months later, construction, which drives rats into the open and had been halted like everything else, returned. Outdoor dining expanded as restaurants struggled to survive.\", \"[N.Y.C. Rats: They\\u2019re in the Park, on Your Block and Even at Your Table]\", \"Along the way, the city inspectors who hunt for evidence of rats were assigned elsewhere, including mass vaccination sites and restaurants, where their mission was to see that customers\\u2019 proofs of vaccination were being checked.\", \"A wetter-than-usual summer, coupled with other effects of a warming climate that have helped rats thrive, compounded the problem, health officials said. By October, the animals, which breed prolifically, had reached their annual population peak in the city, said Jason Munshi-South, an associate professor of biological sciences at Fordham University.\", \"Now, with temperatures dropping as winter approaches, rats may be somewhat less visible. But they will re-emerge en masse in spring, ready to feast.\", \"When they do, critics say, the restaurant sheds that helped save an industry will be potential feeding grounds. Abandoned sheds are already rodent playpens.\", \"Edward Grayson, the sanitation commissioner, said that last year\\u2019s budget cuts have largely been restored and that the department \\u201cwas doing everything we can to keep the streets clean.\\u201d\", \"Andy Linares, the president of Bug Off Pest Control Center in Upper Manhattan, said rats had \\u201cbecome more brazen in their quest for food and harborage.\\u201d He described watching one appear from under a dumpster and \\u201csaunter\\u201d across the street before slipping down a sewer grate. And Linares, a 40-year veteran of the pest control business, could tell it was a New York rat.\", \"\\u201cIt was jaywalking,\\u201d he said.\", \"Start the week off right with sunny skies and temps in the low 60s during the day and the high 40s at night. Expect a light north wind in the morning.\", \"In effect until Thursday (Veterans Day).\", \"The New York Comedy Festival opens today with performances in 17 theaters and clubs. This made me wonder: Are we ready to laugh again?\", \"\\u201cI think the question is, are we ready to reflect on what has happened,\\u201d the comedian Luke Mones, who will appear in a comedy festival show in Brooklyn on Wednesday, told me. \\u201cUnquestionably, I think the answer is yes on laughing. People I know who have had a particularly difficult stretch are interested in laughing and using comedy and laughter to reflect and look at the last year and a half and grapple with it.\\u201d\", \"When he said \\u201cwhat has happened,\\u201d he was referring, of course, to the pandemic. Even now, nearly a year after the first vaccines were approved, roughly 70,000 people get a coronavirus diagnosis every day. More than 750,000 have died in the United States, including more than 34,000 in New York City. The numbers are down but still disturbing.\", \"Yet the world seems to be shifting to a strategy of living with the coronavirus, and the comedy festival is betting that the best way forward is to listen to someone say, into a microphone, something like, \\u201cWell, that was really weird\\u201d \\u2014 and to laugh about it. That was essentially the premise of a joke Mones tells that he called his \\u201cbubble bit.\\u201d\", \"A bit of that bit goes like this: \\u201cI see people walking around New York like everything\\u2019s normal. People are just glassy-eyed, walking down the street like \\u2018I just had brunch in a plastic bubble in the bike lane. Everything is normal.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Mones said the bit was rooted in an are-we-ready question, though not the one about laughing: \\u201cWhen are we going to acknowledge the enormity of this situation?\\u201d\", \"Maybe this is the moment, at least for those planning to attend comedy festival events. Caroline Hirsch, who founded the festival and owns the comedy club Carolines on Broadway, told me that the tickets for an event tonight at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center had \\u201csold out in a minute.\\u201d That event, \\u201cStand Up for Heroes,\\u201d is a benefit for the Bob Woodruff Foundation, co-founded by the ABC News correspondent who was injured in a roadside bomb explosion in Iraq 15 years ago. Some 200 shows have been scheduled for the festival, featuring performers like Jim Gaffigan, Nikki Glazer, Bill Maher and Michelle Wolf.\", \"But about whether we are ready to laugh. I thought the most memorable answer came from the comedian and columnist Maeve Higgins, who described restarting a weekly show that she hosted before the pandemic with Aparna Nacheria and Jo Firestone in Brooklyn. Higgins wrote that the people in the audience could have stayed home and watched \\u201cany number of perfect comedy shows\\u201d online or on television.\", \"Instead, she wrote, \\u201cthey spend 90 minutes with us, willing us on as we stumble our way back to funny.\\u201d\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"I was walking my dog on the Lower East Side when I saw a man outside a bodega wearing a paper cook\\u2019s hat and a white apron. He was throwing something into the trash can on the corner.\", \"On the side of the hat, scrawled in red crayon, were the words \\u201cIt\\u2019s my birthday. Free hugs!!!\\u201d\", \"A woman who was crossing the street yelled to the man in the hat.\", \"\\u201cHey, go get me a couple pieces cheese!\\u201d she said.\", \"\\u201cWhat?\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cGo get me a couple pieces cheese.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know nothin\\u2019 \\u2019bout cheese.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cA couple pieces white cheese.
