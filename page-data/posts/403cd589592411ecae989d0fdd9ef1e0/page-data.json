ahead of his victims in a scathing review into its response to requests for information.\", \"The Tasmanian Health Service's (THS) handling of allegations against James Geoffrey Griffin \\u2014 who took his life in 2019 after being charged with child sex offences \\u2014\\u00a0has been singled out for special attention in the Commission of Inquiry into child sex abuse.\", \"But behind the scenes, the department has argued it would be against the public interest to release details of complaints against Griffin while he worked on the Launceston General Hospital (LGH) children's ward \\u2014\\u00a0despite Ombudsman Richard Connock finding many documents requested by freelance journalist Camille Bianchi early last year could be published in some form.\", \"In April 2020, Bianchi applied under Right to Information laws, for records of staff complaints, reports and email correspondence relating to Griffin's behaviour while working on Ward 4K.\", \"More than 100 pages of relevant information were unearthed \\u2014\\u00a0but the department claimed none of the documents could be released, citing privacy issues, concern for the mental health of Griffin's friends, family and former colleagues, and fears publicising such information could deter people from making similar reports in the future.\", \"<img

for 10 years.(ABC News: Luke Bowden)</div>\", \"A decision published by Mr Connock about a month ago disagreed.\", \"\\\"Allegations against Mr Griffin were never formally proven and were denied by him, and there are valid procedural fairness concerns in releasing documents regarding disputed allegations and unfinalised disciplinary and criminal proceedings,\\\" Mr Connock wrote.\", \"The THS argued LGH staff were suffering stress and anxiety over the \\\"matters associated with Mr Griffin\\\", feelings compounded by guilt and grief.\", \"\\\"While the department's consideration of the interests of its staff and Mr Griffin's associates is understandable, I am concerned that it does not appear to have considered the interests of the victims of Mr Griffin's alleged offending while he was in its employ and the concerns of LGH patients and the general public about the adequacy of management of concerns by the department as highly,\\\" Mr Connock said.\", \"\\\"In contrast, the department does not once mention or appear to consider the victims of Mr Griffin's alleged offending or the valid community concern and desire for accountability from the department, given that abuse is alleged to have occurred against vulnerable child patients receiving care in a public hospital over an extended period.\\\"\", \"The documents have still not been released, but the Ombudsman's account of the records shows relevant documents included:\", \"Bianchi,\\u00a0who pushed ahead with podcast The Nurse despite the THS's refusal to cooperate,\\u00a0said the Ombudsman's review was enlightening.\", \"\\\"This information belongs to the patients and staff at LGH, and many others whose lives have been impacted by the matters raised in these documents.\\\"\", \"<img

Bianchi)</div>\", \"Five women contacted Tasmania Police with complaints of sexual abuse in the months leading to his death.\", \"The first woman to contact police alleged Griffin had sexually abused her from the age of 11.\", \"According to the coroner's report into his death, Griffin made admissions of sexual misconduct in relation to her.\", \"Police also found \\\"a significant amount of child exploitation material\\\", including \\\"self-generated images\\\" after searching his home.\"]","href_hash":"403cd589592411ecae989d0fdd9ef1e0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"403cd589592411ecae989d0fdd9ef1e0"}},
