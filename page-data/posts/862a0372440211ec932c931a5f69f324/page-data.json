The huge demand for aid underscores the severe economic pain inflicted by the coronavirus outbreak.\", \"Since the $2.4 billion program started this summer, the state has received nearly 280,000 applications for help paying overdue rent and utility bills.\", \"As of this week, New York had paid out $1 billion \\u2014 nearly 85 percent in cases involving New York City renters \\u2014 with another $1.1 billion committed to be given out but where more paperwork was needed from landlords.\", \"There were an estimated 100,000 additional applications pending, but state officials declined to say how many of those applicants could be denied money.\", \"Officials said the application window would close at 10 p.m. Sunday across the state except in a few smaller counties, like Dutchess and Oneida Counties, which had not yet exhausted their pool of funds.\", \"The development was a striking reversal from this summer, when the state was among the slowest nationwide at distributing its share of rental assistance and when the application process was rife with glitches.\", \"New York did not issue a single payment until August, one of the last states in the country to do so, but is now among the fastest, as several other states have continued to lag.\", \"The development also reflected the severity of the economic crisis in New York, which has more renters than any other state. Even before the pandemic, more than a quarter of the state\\u2019s households spent more than half their income on rent and some utilities.\", \"Congress approved $46.5 billion in federal pandemic aid for rental assistance, an enormous infusion of money to help struggling renters, but it has not been enough for the most populated states, especially California, New Jersey and New York. Last week, Texas also said it would not accept new applications after the number of requests exceeded the rent relief available.\", \"The developments in Texas and New York come as the federal government is poised to consider whether to redistribute rent relief from states that do not need it or did not use it to states with greater need. Some housing groups have urged the United States Treasury Department, which distributed the aid, to redirect unused assistance from smaller states.\", \"On Friday, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she had asked the federal government for almost $1 billion in additional funding for rent relief.\", \"\\u201cWhile New York accelerated getting rent relief out the door and moved from the back of the pack to the front amongst other states, there are still many individuals in need of assistance,\\u201d she said.\", \"A state moratorium on evictions that is set to expire early next year has kept thousands of people in their homes even as their arrears continue to pile up. For many who were laid off during the pandemic, the rent relief program is a vital financial lifeline for tenants and for many smaller landlords who rely on rent to pay their own bills.\", \"Applications were expected to remain open for two separate state programs, a $125 million initiative targeting middle-income tenants, as well as another special $125 million program for landlords whose tenants could not or did not apply for other rental assistance programs.\", \"Michael Johnson, a spokesman for the Community Housing Improvement Program, a landlord group in New York City, said that based on his organization\\u2019s surveys, the number of renters in New York State who qualify for relief but had yet to apply could exceed 100,000.\", \"Some people do not know about the program\\u2019s existence, he said, while others do not have internet access to apply.\", \"\\u201cThe biggest concern is that there are people who might be able to get money but no one has ever reached them,\\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s the biggest frustration to this.\\u201d\", \"Ann Korchak, a landlord who is a member of the Small Property Owners of New York, said that essentially shutting down the application portal would be another setback for property owners.\", \"\\u201cSmall owners can\\u2019t continue to carry this burden,\\u201d Ms. Korchak said. \\u201cThe burden this is putting on small property owners is crushing.\\u201d\", \"The application process has frustrated both landlords and tenants. Both sides must provide documents to the state for payments to be approved, meaning that if one side refuses or cannot be reached, the money will not be issued.\", \"Ellen Davidson, a staff attorney with the Legal Aid Society, a nonprofit that helps people with the rent relief program, said \\u201cit would be a disaster if we don\\u2019t get more funds, when you look at how many tenants before Covid were struggling to pay rent, and then you put on top of it the extreme economic crisis that came from having to shut down the state in order to save lives.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"862a0372440211ec932c931a5f69f324"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"862a0372440211ec932c931a5f69f324"}},
