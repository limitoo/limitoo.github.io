A school safety guard reportedly could not stop the suspect from escaping the school.\", \"About five minutes later, the teenager allegedly got into a second altercation about a block from the school.

According to police, the teen cut through the man's jacket several times but not his arm.\", \"The teenager threw a water bottle\\u2014which police believe may have been the same one he stole from the boy\\u2014at the man, the Daily News reported.\", \"The teenager then fled down 85 Avenue toward Parson Boulevard, where he later got into a third altercation with an employee of a local deli, police said.\", \"On Saturday, authorities released a surveillance photo from the deli and a sketch of the teenager.

In the wake of that incident, at least 60 schools in Michigan were forced to temporarily close due to copycat threats.\", \"One day earlier also in New York, metal detectors in three schools in Brooklyn discovered 21 weapons carried by students. They consisted of nine knives, four stun guns, seven cans of pepper spray, and a pair of brass knuckles. Greg Floyd, the president of Teamsters Local 237, which represents school safety agents, however, told the New York Post the discovery of the weapons was only \\\"the tip of the iceberg.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"ceaef7c8554711ec9f0b01ee7425c634"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ceaef7c8554711ec9f0b01ee7425c634"}},
