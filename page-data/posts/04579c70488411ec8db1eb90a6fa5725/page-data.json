Their mistake was understandable: The front window appeared to have been spray-painted with the word \\u201cGucci.\\u201d\", \"The occasion for the faux vandalism was the second installment of the Hacker Project series, with items dropping at 74 Balenciaga locations.\", \"At first glance, the drop looked as if Gucci had set up an accessories pop-up inside the Balenciaga store. The bags, hats, scarves and wallets mimicked Gucci\\u2019s tone-on-tone patterns and signature green and red stripe.\", \"But on closer inspection, they were patterned not with Gucci G\\u2019s but with Balenciaga B\\u2019s. An even closer look revealed that the metal clasp is identical to a Gucci bag, apart from its engraving that reads: \\u201cBalenciaga.\\u201d\", \"If this is confusing, it\\u2019s meant to be. The Hacker Project was created by Balenciaga\\u2019s creative director Demna Gvasalia and Gucci\\u2019s Alessandro Michele to pose questions about luxury, authenticity and inspiration.\", \"It is at once super-simple and hard to explain. The artist Jack Greer was on hand to customize shopping bags with \\u201cTHIS IS NOT A GUCCI BAG\\u201d in a drippy graffiti font. For customers who wanted a bag with less Magritte and more of themselves, Mr. Greer was also tagging bags with \\u201cTHIS IS [your name\\u2019s] BAG.\\u201d\", \"Business was steady in the first few hours after the opening, with a mix of tourists, Balenciaga fans and private couriers buzzing in and out of the store. Some fans rejoiced, some shoppers scratched their heads, and several security guards who worked in the neighborhood stopped to make sure the store window hadn\\u2019t actually been vandalized.\", \"Name: Ryan LeeAge: 25Lives in: Washington, D.C.\", \"Tell me about your kicks.They\\u2019re Jordan Fours. I used to be an assistant manager at Finish Line, and low-key that turned me into a hypebeast. It got me into the shoes and the culture and everything.\", \"Is that a Gucci bag you\\u2019re carrying?It\\u2019s a Louis bag, actually. It\\u2019s a graduation present I bought for myself. I graduated from University of Virginia last May, and I just got a job this week.\", \"What\\u2019s your job?Economic research. I just bought the scarf and a card holder to celebrate.\", \"Name: Luis NajeraAge: 43Lives in: Miami via Mexico City.\", \"You\\u2019re obviously a Gucci fan with your frames.I am. Alessandro Michele has done a fantastic job. And now they\\u2019re doing this collaboration with Balenciaga, I think it\\u2019s the best collaboration that they\\u2019ve done so far. The monogram is over the top. I\\u2019m going to go to Gucci now.\", \"Do you work in fashion?I work for Yamamoto design, an Adidas collaboration.\", \"Tell me about your jacket.My Commes des Gar\\u00e7ons jacket? This is another collaboration as well, with a brand from the U.K.\", \"Name: Carlyn PowellOccupation: Education administratorAge: 50Lives in: Long Island\", \"Could we take your picture?My Uber\\u2019s coming in one minute, but sure.\", \"What did you think of the collaboration?I\\u2019m loving this hacker thing. Being from New York, as soon as I saw the graffiti I was like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s so New York.\\u201d And merging the two houses is so smooth.\", \"So you don\\u2019t think the graffiti is a blight?No, I love it. And inside they had the gentleman writing on the bags, doing the graffiti right here. It\\u2019s such a dare to do it because when it comes to our bags, we don\\u2019t want to get a mark or anything on it. But, again, it\\u2019s the graffiti that grabs me.\", \"Where are you heading in this Uber?I\\u2019m heading to Penn Station and then back out to the island. But he\\u2019s still a minute away. He must be at the light.\", \"Name: Nick CollinsOccupation: StylistAge: 33Lives in: Hell\\u2019s Kitchen\", \"Did you rhinestone those pants yourself?No, these are Y/Project.\", \"They\\u2019re magnificent.I\\u2019ve been really abusing them because I can\\u2019t get over how obsessed I am with them.\", \"Did anything in the store appeal to you?I\\u2019m a stylist, so I just came to see what they had available. I\\u2019m in stores Monday through Friday all day. I see everything, so I\\u2019m kind of numb to luxury retail at this point.\", \"What are you looking for when you\\u2019re in stores?Our clients are looking for less widely available items \\u2014 limited-edition watches, jewelry, exotic handbags. I work for a private personal shopping company based in the Middle East.\", \"Are your clients mostly in the Middle East, too?No, we\\u2019ve been operating for almost seven years so we have clients all over the world now.\", \"Can you say what the name of your company is?I can\\u2019t. Sorry.\", \"Name: Miles DeNiroOccupation: EntertainerAge: 33Lives in: Harlem\", \"Tell me about this baby Balenciaga bag around your neck.This is an ode to the old Crist\\u00f3bal Balenciaga designs and the silhouettes he used to create. So it\\u2019s got history, it\\u2019s cute, but it\\u2019s too small. What can you put in this? Literally, it\\u2019s got keys in here.\", \"What\\u2019s this shrug you\\u2019re wearing?A dead rabbit. I don\\u2019t know. This leather coat is vintage Ralph Lauren.\", \"What are you doing after this?Terrorizing Bergdorf. I want to scare old ladies.\", \"\", \"Name: Shawn LovejoyOccupation: See belowAge: 39Lives in: the Lower East Side\", \"What brought you to Balenciaga today?I\\u2019m looking for boots. \\u2019Tis the season. I wanted something that had a little heft and chunk and funk. But they make things that look like you could destroy Tokyo in them.\", \"So where are you looking next?I already looked everywhere else. I could tell you where they are, but it\\u2019s a long list.\", \"Was Prada too funky for you?Yeah, just too Lego blocks.\", \"What do you do for a living?It\\u2019s my last day at my job. For the last 10 years I\\u2019ve been working as a product and packaging designer for Tom Ford Beauty.\", \"And now what?Sabbatical. Recenter, rebalance, refresh.\", \"Name: Patrick PierreOccupation: Online marketerAge: 25Lives in: Portland, Ore.\", \"Did you walk in with that fanny pack?Yeah, I walked in with it.\", \"So what\\u2019d you get?We got the black and white Balenci-socks. I really went in to try on the sky blue Triple S\\u2019s because I wanted to see how they felt. I\\u2019m going to buy them in a month. I\\u2019m going to budget them out.\", \"What was your thought on the \\u201chack?\\u201dTo be honest with you, I didn\\u2019t even notice it. My focus was on those sky blue Triple S\\u2019s. That is hot.\", \"What\\u2019s good about them?Coming in here, my mentality was to go for the speed trainers. But we were standing in a post office earlier today, and I saw a lady in the speed trainers, and I asked her opinion. She told me that as a New Yorker, the speed trainers work for her. But if I\\u2019m from Portland, where it rains all the time, it\\u2019s better to go with the Triple S\\u2019s.\", \"Name: Mikhaele IbleOccupation: Account executiveAge: 34Lives in: East New York\", \"What\\u2019s the reaction been wearing the YZY GAP puffer?Everyone\\u2019s asking questions. They want to know if it\\u2019s warm, when you got it, that kind of stuff.\", \"So when did you get it?Sometime last week.\", \"Do you identify as a hypebeast?I don\\u2019t think so. You can\\u2019t tell because I\\u2019m wearing Kanye. But if it\\u2019s not Kanye, I don\\u2019t care for it.\", \"What about Kanye do you like so much?I just like what he represents: A freethinker, going against the grain, speaking truth no matter if it costs you.\", \"Any plans to go to Wyoming like he did?Absolutely not.\", \"Name: Vincent JacksonAge: 40\", \"Lives in: Los AngelesName: Nicole RobinsonAge: 49Lives in: Los Angeles\", \"So you didn\\u2019t know anything about the collaboration?N.R.: No, we were just walking by, and we thought someone had actually sprayed \\u201cGucci\\u201d on their store.\", \"V.J.: I was like, \\u201cThey\\u2019re really wilding out here in New York.\\u201d\", \"What brought you to New York?N.R.: We came here for a friend\\u2019s birthday party. We\\u2019re leaving today.\", \"You didn\\u2019t buy anything at Balenciaga?N.R.: No, I\\u2019m not a fan yet. I\\u2019m trying to find the Louis store.\", \"Name: Lamart \\u201cLJ\\u201d JamesOccupation: MessengerAge: 27Lives in: Uptown Manhattan\", \"So, what brought you to Balenciaga today?I do messenger work. They sent me to the wrong address. I\\u2019ve got to go around the corner.\", \"Did you get a look at anything?Not really. I was going to look at the Gucci/Balenciaga stuff, but I\\u2019m working right now.\", \"Tell me about your mask.This is a great mask. I actually got it from one of the people who does screen printing for Billionaire Boys Club.\", \"What\\u2019s this jacket? I love it.This jacket is actually Zara. Just like a canvas, paint-splattered-all-over-the-place jacket.\"]","href_hash":"04579c70488411ec8db1eb90a6fa5725"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"04579c70488411ec8db1eb90a6fa5725"}},
