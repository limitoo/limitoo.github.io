Along with his father, Gregory McMichael, and their neighbor William Bryan, he stands accused of chasing Mr. Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, in two trucks through the Satilla Shores neighborhood outside the city of Brunswick. When Travis McMichael got out of his truck, he and Mr. Arbery struggled over Mr. McMichael\\u2019s shotgun.\", \"Mr. McMichael described the encounter as a \\u201clife or death\\u201d situation and said he suspected that Mr. Arbery was a burglar who was potentially armed. No evidence has been presented that Mr. Arbery had a weapon with him.\", \"Mr. McMichael said that when he ultimately pulled the trigger, Mr. Arbery was overpowering him.\", \"\\u201cI shot again because I was still fighting,\\u201d he testified. \\u201cHe was all over me, he was still all over that shotgun and he was not relenting.\\u201d\", \"After a third shot, according to video, Mr. Arbery collapsed.\", \"\\u201cI was in shock,\\u201d Mr. McMichael said.\", \"He described the encounter as \\u201cthe most traumatic experience of my life.\\u201d\", \"Asked by his lawyer if he had left his house that day intending to kill Mr. Arbery, he replied, \\u201cI did not.\\u201d\", \"The defense team has argued that the men suspected Mr. Arbery of committing a series of local break-ins. He had been spotted several times on security camera video at a nearby home under construction.\", \"Mr. McMichael described a neighborhood that had been increasingly on edge over what he called \\u201csteady\\u201d crime. He said the \\u201ctypically small-town\\u201d community had been overtaken by thefts and break-ins. Cars, including his own truck, had been broken into. Belongings had been stolen, he said, including his pistol and a neighbor\\u2019s trailer.\", \"\\u201cIt was continuous,\\u201d he said. \\u201cEvery couple months, you would hear of something else, something else.\\u201d\", \"When Mr. Arbery was seen running through the neighborhood on the afternoon of Feb. 23, 2020, the men pursued him \\u2014 a decision that prosecutors have characterized as one based on flimsy assumptions about Mr. Arbery and his presence in Satilla Shores.\", \"\\u201cHe was mad,\\u201d Mr. McMichael said. \\u201cWhich made me think that something has happened. It\\u2019s not what I expected.\\u201d\", \"He continued: \\u201cThis guy is obviously \\u2014 something is not right. He seems dangerous to me.\\u201d\", \"Toward the end of his testimony, Mr. McMichael described the moment he realized that Mr. Arbery had died.\", \"\\u201cI stood up, realized that I had a gun here, and that he\\u2019s passed away, and the police are on the scene,\\u201d Mr. McMichael said, his voice breaking as he neared tears. \\u201cSo I walked over to the side, and put my shotgun down. After that, it was a blur.\\u201d\", \"Mr. McMichael is expected back on the witness stand on Thursday morning.\"]","href_hash":"9c14827c481511ec82c66f483a92531f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9c14827c481511ec82c66f483a92531f"}},
