It\\u2019s Monday. We\\u2019ll look at the mood in New York City after three emotionally grueling weeks. We\\u2019ll also look at a mural that is leaving Rikers Island after 50 years.\", \"For many New Yorkers, the steady drumbeat of terrible news since Jan. 1 has compounded the cheerlessness of the pandemic.\", \"There was the 19-year-old Burger King worker who was killed during a robbery in Manhattan. There was the fire in a Bronx high-rise that killed 17 people. There was the woman who was killed when a man shoved her in front of a subway pulling into the Times Square station. There was the 11-month-old baby sitting in a parked car in the Bronx who was hit by a bullet. There were the officers in the Bronx and Staten Island who were shot and wounded.\", \"And on Friday, one police officer was killed and another was critically wounded when a gunman opened fire inside a Harlem apartment.\", \"For many New Yorkers, the violence has made the city feel suddenly unfamiliar. Three of my colleagues \\u2014 Michael Wilson, Chelsia Rose Marcius and Nate Schweber \\u2014 write that there\\u2019s a new and deep unease at what can look like an erosion of social norms and a loss of a sense of security.\", \"And it has come as the coronavirus pandemic drags into a third year. Cases have started to fall nationally, signaling that the Omicron-fueled spike appears to be letting up. New York City reported 13,422 cases on Saturday, down 63 percent from two weeks ago. But 84 people were hospitalized, slightly more than double the number hospitalized on Jan. 8.\", \"[A Grim January Leaves Some New Yorkers Fearful for the City\\u2019s Future]\", \"The collective dismay is particularly acute for people old enough to remember bad-old-days New York. It is true that shootings and homicides have risen since 2018, but they remain a fraction of what they were 30 years ago. There were 488 homicides in 2021, compared with 2,262 at their peak in the crack wars in 1990.\", \"\\u201cThings happened in the \\u201990s, but not like this,\\u201d said Michael Marcus, a 54-year-old barber whose shop in Harlem is a block from the apartment where the two officers were shot. \\u201cRight now, I don\\u2019t feel like it\\u2019s going to get better. And if it does, it\\u2019s going to take a while.\\u201d\", \"Mayor Eric Adams said over the weekend he hoped it would take \\u201cdays, if possible,\\u201d not months or years, to see results from steps he would take to address gun violence. Adams has fast-tracked the timeline for doing something substantive to bolster public safety.\", \"His forthcoming \\u201cBlueprint for Safety\\u201d will focus on the underlying reasons for violence. It will also outline initiatives like reinstating a plainclothes police unit that was involved in a disproportionate number of fatal shootings. The unit was disbanded under former Mayor Bill de Blasio after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020.\", \"Gov. Kathy Hochul said that an interstate task force on illegal guns would meet this week, bringing together law enforcement officials from nine northeastern states. Two of the guns used in shootings last week were reminders of the danger posed by illegal firearms that reached New York through the so-called Iron Pipeline up the Eastern Seaboard. The Glock 45 pistol in Friday\\u2019s shooting in Harlem had been reported stolen in Baltimore in 2017. The police also said that the gun that a 16-year-old fired at an officer during a confrontation in the Bronx on Tuesday had been stolen in South Carolina in 2020.\", \"\\u201cNew York doesn\\u2019t manufacture guns,\\u201d said David Caba, the senior program director for Bronx Rises Against Gun Violence, a community program that stations anti-violence teams in three sections of the borough. \\u201cEveryone knows they are coming up the Iron Pipeline, I-95, and across I-80 from Ohio, but I-95 is the major one.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe big picture is it\\u2019s the socioeconomic issues that are driving this,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf housing improves, if employment improves, guess what also improves? Public safety.\\u201d\", \"At least it will be sunny today. The high will be near 34, but with the wind chill, it will feel more like the 20s. Tonight there will be a slight chance of snow showers with a low around 30.\", \"In effect until Jan 31. (Lunar New Year\\u2019s Eve).\", \"The vibrant 8 by 8 foot mural has an unusual history, starting with where it was hung when it was completed in the 1970s \\u2014 a jail on Rikers Island.\", \"It was both a first and a last \\u2014 the first public commission by the artist Faith Ringgold, and the last oil-on-stretched-canvas piece that she did for years. It was called \\u201cFor the Women\\u2019s House.\\u201d The warden\\u2019s willingness to let Ringgold interview inmates and install the mural seemed to hint at an optimistic, good-government approach to municipal facilities.\", \"Now, after being shunted to a hallway where few people could see it, the mural is being relocated to the Brooklyn Museum.\", \"As our writer Zachary Small explained, the city\\u2019s Public Design Commission, which has jurisdiction over art at city-owned properties, agreed to the move. The commission\\u2019s decision last week followed a request by Mayor Bill de Blasio, in the final days of his administration, that the mural go to the museum on a long-term loan. But next month it will be sent to to the New Museum on the Bowery for an exhibition, \\u201cFaith Ringgold: American People,\\u201d which will open on Feb. 17.\", \"Ringgold, known for her \\u201cstory quilts\\u201d and her impassioned activism, had won a $3,000 grant for the mural. She met with inmates, asking what they would like to see. The result showed women in careers that the inmates believed were beyond their reach: president, professional basketball player, minister, construction worker, bus driver. \\u201cAll the things life could bring them if they had freedom,\\u201d she said in 2020.\", \"The mural remained where it had been installed until the women\\u2019s facility was converted to house men, and it was whitewashed. Eventually a restorer removed the white paint, and the mural was hung in the gym of a new women\\u2019s facility, the Rose M. Singer Center, which, along with the rest of the Rikers jail complex, is scheduled to close by 2027.\", \"Ringgold said last week that she had tried for nearly a decade to have it moved, failing to strike a deal with at least one university because of the cost of insurance. It was lent out at least once, for an exhibition of her works at the Neuberger Museum in Purchase, N.Y., in 2010.\", \"The city said that to \\u201cto promote beauty and healing within the jails,\\u201d the nonprofit Art for Justice Fund, founded by the philanthropist Agnes Gund, had offered to underwrite a new mural that will fill the space vacated by \\u201cFor the Women\\u2019s House.\\u201d\", \"Not everyone celebrated the art commission\\u2019s decision to send the mural to the Brooklyn Museum. Some art historians and preservationists said that moving the mural to a private institution was a sign that the city cannot care for its own art collection.\", \"\\u201cIt troubles me that the city is embarking on this kind of enterprise again,\\u201d said Michele Bogart, an art historian specializing in the city\\u2019s public works. \\u201cAnd I just keep wondering whether they are doing a disservice to the people who are still in Rikers.\\u201d\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"A few years ago, I was at a wedding in Berlin. Most of the guests were German, but sitting across from me was an American who, it turned out, also lived in New York City.\", \"\\u201cWhere do you live in the city?\\u201d I asked her.\", \"\\u201cUpper Gramercy,\\u201d she said.\", \"\\u201cWouldn\\u2019t that be considered Murray Hill?\\u201d I said.\", \"\\u201cYes,\\u201d she answered politely.\", \"\\u2014 Daphn\\u00e9 Jouanneteau\", \"Illustrated by Agnes Lee.
