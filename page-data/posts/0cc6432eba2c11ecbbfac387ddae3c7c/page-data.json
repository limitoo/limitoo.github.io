The fall caused a skull fracture and brain swelling, and Vake died nine days later in hospital.\", \"Two years and nine months in prison for taking someone's life was not enough for Vake's friend and fellow MMA fighter Dan Hooker.\", \"\\\"It's heartbreaking. Two years [and nine months'] sentence for killing someone is not a deterrent whatsoever. There has to be some kind of change - I don't know anyone who can accept that,\\\" Hooker said outside court.\", \"\\\"It is despicable to claim a sentence two years and nine months for a man who violently took someone's life is sufficient.

There's an eight-year minimum for killing someone with a coward punch. That's an eight-year minimum.
