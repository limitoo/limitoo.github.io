So far, only 34 police officers and 40 civilian police employees have been placed on unpaid leave, he said. As of Sunday, about 1 in 6 police personnel were still unvaccinated.\", \"According to Mayor Bill de Blasio, about 9,000 of the city's municipal workers were put on unpaid leave for refusing to comply with the COVID-19 requirement that took effect Monday. About 9 in 10 city workers required to be vaccinated have received the vaccine, and there have been no disruptions to city services from staff shortages, de Blasio said.\", \"More than 3,500 city workers were vaccinated over the weekend because of the approaching deadline. Other incentives were also given, such as a 5 p.m. Friday deadline to collect a $500 bonus for proof of vaccination before they were to be put on unpaid leave.\", \"About 12,000 New York City workers have applied for religious or medical exemptions, in which they are allowed to remain on the job while city officials review their applications.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1923874/new-york-vaccine-mandate.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A citywide vaccine mandate took effect Monday, requiring New York City municipal workers such as police officers and firefighters to get the COVID-19 vaccine, and just under three dozen police officers were placed on unpaid leave.

Sanitation workers made an extra pickup on Sunday to ensure trash wouldn't pile up, the mayor said.\", \"\\\"I want to thank everyone who got vaccinated,\\\" de Blasio said. \\\"Thank you for getting vaccinated. Thank you for doing the right thing. Thank you for moving us forward.\\\"\", \"City officials have been battling fierce resistance among a minority of workers in some critical public safety jobs, including police officers and firefighters, as well as a pending legal challenge to the mandate by the city's largest police union.\", \"As of Sunday, 1 in 4 of the city's uniformed firefighters still hadn't gotten a first dose of the vaccine, as required.\", \"About 2,300 firefighters were out sick, up from what's normally about 1,000 per day, in what Nigro said appeared to be a protest against the vaccine mandate. The fire department's medical office normally sees about 200 people a day, Nigro said. The past week, it has been 700 a day, the majority unvaccinated.\", \"\\\"I've asked them to rethink this, to remember their oath of office,\\\" Nigro said. \\\"It's not only affecting the people they serve, it's affecting their brothers and sisters in the department who are forced to fill their spots.\\\"\", \"De Blasio said the city is watching to see if the firefighters union is coordinating the sick-outs and would take them to court if there's evidence of an illegal strike.

It's not acceptable.\\\"\", \"City officials have said they are prepared for possible staffing shortfalls, calling in vaccinated employees for overtime shifts.\", \"The head of the union that represents New York City firefighters, which has fought the vaccine mandate, warned that public safety could be at risk. The fire department has said it was prepared to take up to 20 percent of its fire companies out of service and and have 20 percent fewer ambulances on the road.\", \"\\\"We're here today because of a mandate that was put not only on our members, but also all New York City employees, given nine days to make a life-changing decision on their career or whether or not they're going to take a vaccine,\\\" Uniformed Firefighters Association President Andrew Ansbro said at an early morning news conference.\", \"De Blasio has said the city's highest public safety priority is stopping the spread of COVID-19, which continues to kill a handful of people in the city every day.\"]","href_hash":"c8b777423b5611eca8a7000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c8b777423b5611eca8a7000017025a03"}},
