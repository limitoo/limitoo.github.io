He claims no Japanese troops were killed in the encounter and suggests the soldiers likely slipped off the cliff.\", \"In 2016, Hong was ordered to publicly apologize for defaming martyrs and the CAC once again insisted the two surviving soldiers were saved by trees.\", \"On November 25, 1950, Mao Zedong's eldest son, Mao Anying was killed by an American napalm attack in North Korea. A circulating story maintains Mao Anying's insistence on cooking egg fried rice, a rare delicacy back in the day, exposed his unit's position to American planes.\", \"Some have speculated that if not for egg fried rice, China's ruler today could be Mao Anying or his son.\", \"For professor Janku this is another example of an insignificant event that can't be proved or confirmed.\", \"\\\"It sounds like the type of story people will tell each other when having dinner,\\\" she said, \\\"but the point again is to emphasize that heroes can't be neither doubted nor ridiculed\\\".\", \"Lei Feng was a young a soldier in China's \\\"People's Liberation Army\\\" (PLA) and the poster boy for several propaganda campaigns.\", \"In 1963, a year after his death at only 21 years old, his diary became required reading as part of a \\\"Learn from Lei Feng\\\" campaign that aimed to inspire China's youth to sacrifice for the nation.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927659/lei-feng.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Lei Feng, Chinese soldier of the People's Liberation Army, c1962. In the posthumous Learn from Comrade Lei Feng campaign, initiated by Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong in 1963, Lei (1940-1962) became the symbol of nationwide propaganda. He was portrayed as a selfless, modest man devoted to the Communist Party, Chairman Mao and the Chinese people and was held up as an example for the youth of China to aspire to follow. Lei was killed in an accident while on duty. </div>\", \"In 2013, the 50th anniversary of the \\\"Learn from Lei Feng\\\" campaign, one internet user was arrested, The New York Times reported, for suggesting Lei sought luxury by writing online: \\\"The high-end apparel that Lei Feng bought for himself in 1959- leather jacket, woolen pants, leather shoes-would have cost about 90 yuan at the time, but his pay was only 6 yuan a month.\\\"\", \"In 1934, during a civil war, Chinese Communists broke through Nationalist enemy lines and began an epic trek known as the \\\"Long March\\\" which marked the emergence of Mao Zedong as the undisputed leader of the Chinese Communists. He led thousands of Communist troops along a winding route from Jiangxi province to Shaanxi.\", \"Prof. Janku thinks the question is irrelevant. \\\"Whether the trek was 25,000 li or a little less, what is important is that the leadership feels that if people are arguing that the claim is wrong they are in fact trying to diminish the heroic deed. The same would apply to the story of the battle of Luding Bridge,\\\" referencing a battle (see below) that has gained near mythical status in China.\", \"According to the SOAS professor, the entire story of the Long March is a propaganda coup in the first place. \\\"Ultimately, it is the story of a glorious defeat. Fewer than 10% of those who started the trek arrived at its endpoint in Yan'an. The CCP was close to being wiped out.\\\"\", \"\\\"The difference is obviously that there was nothing to mock about Mao's Long March. The CCP's ultimate victory in 1949 cemented this story.\\\"\", \"During the Battle of Luding Bridge during the Long March, a small group of soldiers secured a bridge across the Dadu River under heavy fire.\", \"However, in a speech at Stanford University, a former national security advisor to China, Zbigniew Brzezinski, declared that former party chairman Deng Xiaoping had told him the \\\"battle\\\" was largely the concoction of propagandists.\", \"An estimated 14 million Chinese citizens were killed during the World War II.\", \"Some academics argue that the CCP avoided engaging in direct battle with the invading Japanese army, even if the party insists that they were a leading force in the war.\", \"The Wall Street Journal reviewed Rana Mitter's \\\"China's Good War,\\\" in which the author argues that China's revisionist history of World War II is an attempt to claim it was \\\"present at the creation\\\" of the international world order.\", \"Land Reform was the communist party's first nationwide political program. Those with considerable landholdings were labeled \\\"landlords,\\\" and their land was expropriated.\", \"In 2017, Maoists attacked Fang Fang, the Wuhan author later targeted by nationalists for her lockdown diary, for her sympathetic portrayal of landlords in the novel \\\"Soft Burial.\\\"\", \"The Financial Times reported in June that \\\"officials have warned that playing up [the attack on landlords] is historical nihilism.'\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1793497/1950-korean-war-begins.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"The \\\"rumor\\\" about the Korean War is politically sensitive. Officially, \\\"China had no choice but to send its army to fight on Korean soil\\\" to avoid a potential invasion and U.S. aggression. However, the U.S. version is quite different.\", \"Overall, Janku said, \\\"these are all things that people do actually talk about and don't really do any serious harm to the party's authority. More likely, it indicates an ever more tightening regime and increasing control of the public/social media sphere\\\".\", \"A story that will be \\\"crowned,\\\" Janku added, with an upcoming third official version of CCP history soon.\"]","href_hash":"dd43d9ce4a0311ec9d13af47efa02119"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dd43d9ce4a0311ec9d13af47efa02119"}},
