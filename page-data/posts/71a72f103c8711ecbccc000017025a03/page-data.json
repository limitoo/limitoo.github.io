And it’s anything but a period piece.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-03T09:22:04.000Z","content":"[\"Wiletta Mayer walks into the theater already knowing how things will go. Smartly dressed, attractive and middle-aged (don\\u2019t ask for a number, because \\u201ca woman that\\u2019ll tell her age will tell anything\\u201d), she is a veteran actress who\\u2019s played maids and mammies and knows how to cater to white directors and producers. You can call it \\u201cUncle Tomming.\\u201d Or you can call it plain common sense. Either way, it\\u2019s a living.\", \"Until enough is enough.\", \"Alice Childress created Wiletta Mayer, the protagonist of her 1955 play, \\u201cTrouble in Mind,\\u201d to paint a realistic portrait of what it was to be Black in the theater industry. Or to be more accurate: She wanted to portray what it is to be Black in theater, because 66 years later, as the play opens on Broadway this month in a Roundabout Theater Company production, the words Childress wrote remain just as relevant.\", \"And yet this author and play, a comedy-drama about an interracial cast rehearsing an anti-lynching play written by a white author and led by a white director, haven\\u2019t gotten their proper due in the decades since its premiere. Childress was supposed to be the first Black female playwright on Broadway, with a play critiquing the racism and misogyny of the theater industry.\", \"Thanks to interfering white theatermakers and a Broadway unwelcoming to challenging Black art, things didn\\u2019t turn out as planned. But the content of the play, and its troubled production history, prove how rightly \\u201cTrouble in Mind\\u201d and its author should be celebrated as part of the canon.\", \"In the play, Wiletta arrives for her part in \\u201cChaos in Belleville\\u201d alongside a young Black actor named John; an older Black actor named Sheldon; a younger Black actress named Millie; and two white actors, Judy, a well-meaning yet na\\u00efve Yale graduate, and Bill, a neurotic character actor. The play within the play is about a Black man who dares to vote and is killed for it.\", \"During rehearsals Wiletta tries to give the newcomer John tips on how to survive as a Black actor in the business, but her own advice fails when the white director, Al Manners, pushes her to perpetuate stereotypes.\", \"It\\u2019s a familiar scenario, one Childress encountered herself as a young actress in the 1944 Broadway production of \\u201cAnna Lucasta.\\u201d She based Wiletta on the character actress Georgia Burke, who appeared with her in that production. Like Wiletta, Burke had also done her fair share of mammy roles, and she would later appear in the original Broadway \\u201cPorgy and Bess.\\u201d\", \"Burke had problems with the director of \\u201cAnna Lucasta,\\u201d but Childress knew her to complain only to her fellow Black actors; when it came to white directors and producers she kept quiet for the sake of her career.\", \"In \\u201cTrouble in Mind,\\u201d Childress wrote a version of Burke who finally had to speak up.\", \"\\u201cDarling, don\\u2019t think. You\\u2019re great until you start thinking,\\u201d Al Manners says to Wiletta during rehearsals. That kind of condescending treatment may have been par for the course for Black theater performers. Childress, however, was uncompromising.\", \"\\u201cShe was a woman of amazing integrity,\\u201d said Kathy Perkins, Childress\\u2019s friend and the editor of a major anthology of her plays. (She is also the lighting designer for Roundabout\\u2019s production.) \\u201cShe hated the saying \\u2018ahead of your time.\\u2019 Her thing was that people aren\\u2019t ahead of their time; they\\u2019re just choked during their time, they\\u2019re not allowed to do what they should be doing.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s this integrity \\u2014 or, more accurately, the times choking a great writer of integrity \\u2014 that cost Childress Broadway. In an ironic echo of the play\\u2019s plot, Childress found herself at odds with the would-be director when \\u201cTrouble in Mind\\u201d was slated for its Off Broadway premiere. Unwilling to budge, she took over as co-director, along with the actress Clarice Taylor, who starred as Wiletta.\", \"The play premiered on Nov. 5, 1955, at the Greenwich Mews Theater, and ran for 91 performances.\", \"But that version isn\\u2019t the version we know today.\", \"The white producers were concerned about the play\\u2019s ending, which they thought was too negative. According to Perkins, as a relatively new playwright Childress was intimidated by these experienced producers.\", \"And then there was the rest of the cast and crew to think about. Childress was a fierce advocate for unions and workers\\u2019 rights, and feared that pulling the play would cost everyone their jobs. So she conceded, providing an ending of reconciliation and racial harmony, even though she maintained that it was unrealistic.\", \"The New York Times praised the play as \\u201ca fresh, lively and cutting satire\\u201d \\u2014 except for the ending. Childress always regretted the change, and said she\\u2019d never compromise her artistic integrity again. So when \\u201cTrouble in Mind\\u201d was optioned for Broadway with the happy ending and a new title (\\u201cSo Early Monday Morning\\u201d), Childress refused. She would have been the first Black female playwright to see her work there; instead, that honor would go to Lorraine Hansberry four years later, for \\u201cA Raisin in the Sun.\\u201d\", \"Childress, who died in 1994, never had the financial success nor popular recognition that her work merited in her lifetime. It\\u2019s unfortunate because her plays are works of merit. Many of her works, like \\u201cFlorence\\u201d (1949), \\u201cWedding Band: A Love/Hate Story in Black and White\\u201d (1966) and \\u201cWine in the Wilderness\\u201d (1969), are confrontational without being pandering or preachy. Not simply about race, they are also about gender and class and artistry, and challenge their audiences to look at their own prejudices and misconceptions. (Theater for a New Audience is reviving \\u201cWedding Band,\\u201d a tale of interracial love set amid the 1918 flu pandemic, Off Broadway this spring.)\", \"And they\\u2019re clever. The meta structure of \\u201cTrouble in Mind\\u201d makes Childress\\u2019s satire especially poignant; it\\u2019s both explicitly biting and subtly searing.\", \"One reason Childress is often left out of conversations about the American canon is her style. In an essay in \\u201cThe Cambridge Companion to African-American Theater,\\u201d the historian and dramaturge Adrienne Macki Braconi calls Childress a \\u201ctransitional\\u201d writer, unheralded because her work reflects \\u201cthe conventions of dramatic realism.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cCritics often overlook their subtle variations on the form, including such innovations as bold thematic content; assertive, complex female characters; and a focus on lower-class and middle-class blacks,\\u201d Macki Braconi wrote of Childress and the writer Eulalie Spence.\", \"Sandra Shannon, a scholar of Black theater and emeritus professor of African-American literature at Howard University, maintained that Childress\\u2019s blend of naturalistic dialogue and social commentary put her \\u201cat the top of her game\\u201d among playwrights in the late \\u201940s and early \\u201950s. Her plays, Shannon said, \\u201craise awareness, stop short of just getting out and marching in the streets.\\u201d\", \"And La Vinia Delois Jennings, the author of the 1995 book \\u201cAlice Childress\\u201d and a distinguished professor in the humanities at the University of Tennessee, pointed out the \\u201cdynamism\\u201d of Childress\\u2019s works, which so often feature Black women taking agency. The stereotypical trope of the angry Black woman gets turned on its head, Jennings said, proving that anger can be \\u201cliberating \\u2014 a force that brings about change.\\u201d\", \"But for all of Childress\\u2019s dynamism, it still took over 60 years to get her work to a Broadway stage.\", \"Charles Randolph-Wright, who will be directing the Broadway production, said he\\u2019s been eyeing this play for the big stage for more than a decade.\", \"On June 20, 2011, a nonprofit called Project1Voice hosted an event in which 19 theaters across the country did readings of \\u201cTrouble in Mind.\\u201d Randolph-Wright directed a Roundabout reading at the American Airlines Theater, which included Andr\\u00e9 De Shields, Leslie Uggams, Bill Irwin and LaChanze, who will be starring as Wiletta in the full production at the same Broadway venue.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ll never forget everyone coming up to me saying, \\u2018Did you rewrite this?\\u2019 and I was like, \\u2018No, she wrote this in 1955.\\u2019 And they said, \\u2018But you tweaked it \\u2014\\u2019 I said, \\u2018No, I didn\\u2019t touch one thing,\\u201d Randolph-Wright explained.\", \"After all, theater insiders and outsiders are still loudly calling for improved representation more than a half-century later.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s been a false sense of progress. That progress has been in fits and starts,\\u201d Shannon said. \\u201cThe same issues that Childress deals with, or dealt with in the 1950s with \\u2018Trouble in Mind,\\u2019 have always been bubbling beneath the surface. They\\u2019ve never gone away.\\u201d\", \"In one scene in the play, Manners says, \\u201cI want truth. What is truth? Truth is simply whatever you can bring yourself to believe, that is all. You must have integrity about your work.\\u201d\", \"Though the statement comes from a flawed character, the sentiment is Childress all the way. Perkins said that at the end of the day, Childress wouldn\\u2019t say she was writing for white audiences or Black audiences; she only wrote for herself, and she concerned herself first and foremost with the truth, whatever form that would take.\", \"Randolph-Wright said he thinks of John Lewis when he approaches the play. \\u201cIt is \\u2018good trouble,\\u2019 \\u201d he said, referring to the call to action made famous by the activist and congressman. \\u201cIt agitates, it illuminates, it makes you laugh, it\\u2019s entertaining.\\u201d\", \"But he hopes this production will only be the beginning \\u2014 that audiences will learn more about Childress\\u2019s work, and that she and other Black writers will get greater recognition for their contributions to the art form. Because this moment \\u2014 after Black Lives Matter and \\u201cWe See You, White American Theater,\\u201d and when seven new Broadway plays this fall are by Black writers \\u2014 is perfect for Childress, but also for Spence and Ed Bullins and Angelina Weld Grimk\\u00e9 and other Black playwrights past and present.\", \"So will change really come this time around? The version of \\u201cTrouble in Mind\\u201d that\\u2019s finally arriving on Broadway ends inconclusively, not optimistically. The ending Childress\\u2019s producers rejected back in 1955 seems right for right now.\"]","href_hash":"71a72f103c8711ecbccc000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"71a72f103c8711ecbccc000017025a03"}},
