As such, this month\\u2019s list of movies and shows leaving Netflix in the United States should come in especially handy; you can check out literary adaptations, crime movies, existential dramas, family fare and more. (Dates reflect the final day a title is available.)\", \"Before his astonishing four-Oscar haul for \\u201cParasite,\\u201d the director Bong Joon Ho displayed his proficiency for fusing class commentary with genre cinema in this thrilling adaptation of the French graphic novel \\u201cLa Transperceneige.\\u201d The story is set in a post-apocalyptic snowscape, in which the last members of the human race are on a train ride that never ends. But they are separated by class and caste; Chris Evans stars as the passenger who leads a rebellion among his fellow lower-class passengers in the back of the train. The action is gripping, the performances are eccentric, and the messaging is as pointed as ever.Stream it here.\", \"The rotten batting average of the stars of \\u201cFriends\\u201d and their post-\\u201cFriends\\u201d TV shows began right out of the gate, with Matt LeBlanc\\u2019s (mercifully) short-lived spinoff series \\u201cJoey.\\u201d So there\\u2019s perhaps some karmic justice in seeing LeBlanc wind up on arguably the best of the alumni series \\u2014 and starring as himself, no less, a sly spoof on his persona as a pretty boy goof-off, with a dose of self-important actor arrogance thrown in. (He was nominated for four Emmys for the role.) A British-American coproduction, the series benefits from its dual perspective; it has the cynical bite of the best British comedies while showcasing the insiders\\u2019 knowledge of its American creators, David Crane and Jeffrey Klarik (\\u201cFrasier\\u201d).Stream it here.\", \"The writer and director David Lowery (who recently earned raves for \\u201cThe Green Knight\\u201d) turns the connotations of his film\\u2019s title inside out, since a \\u201cghost story\\u201d doesn\\u2019t have to be a horror story. Here, it\\u2019s quietly tragic, the tale of a young and happy married couple (Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara) who are starting their lives in their first shared home when he dies unexpectedly. But he cannot move on; he \\u201chaunts\\u201d their house in a simple, cartoonish \\u201cghost\\u201d costume of a bedsheet, first observing his widowed wife in her unguarded grief, and then those who take on the home after. Mara is devastating, painting a portrait of loss that\\u2019s at times painful to watch, and Lowery\\u2019s keen ear for vernacular speech and eye for detail have rarely been so gracefully showcased.Stream it here.\", \"If you talk to a parent of young children, you will likely not hear much affection for Illumination Studios, the purveyors of some of the laziest, sloppiest and most obnoxious children\\u2019s entertainment around. (\\u201cSing 2,\\u201d in theaters now! New Minions movie next summer!) The studio\\u2019s two best films are most likely its adaptations of Dr. Seuss books \\u2014 unsurprising, as his texts provide such fertile material for animators. This 2012 animated take on Seuss\\u2019s 1971 environmental fable gets a big boost from Danny DeVito\\u2019s robust vocal performance as the title character; this is an actor whose voice was built for cartoons, and he makes his Lorax into a showstopping creation.Stream it here.\", \"It\\u2019s not hard to make fun of \\u201cthe Twilight Saga\\u201d (five films total, all leaving Netflix mid-month): Plenty of people have, from lazy film critics to hacky stand-up comics to smarmy YouTube hosts. And, to be clear, these are not great works of cinema; the plotting is silly, the tone is all over the place, and performances are uneven. But there are virtues as well: solid filmmaking (especially this first outing, from the \\u201cThirteen\\u201d director, Catherine Hardwicke); a rare dramatization of budding female sexuality; and most of all, the power the series\\u2019 success gave its stars, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, to make whatever weird art movies they wanted afterward. Did you enjoy \\u201cThe Lighthouse,\\u201d \\u201cPersonal Shopper,\\u201d \\u201cSpencer,\\u201d or \\u201cGood Time\\u201d? Thank \\u201cTwilight.\\u201dStream it here.\", \"This 2013 effort from Sofia Coppola effort plays like a culmination of all of her previous work: the celebrity satire of \\u201cLost in Translation,\\u201d the hedonism of \\u201cMarie Antoinette\\u201d and the California alienation of \\u201cSomewhere,\\u201d stirred into a soup with the real-life story of four young Hollywood hangers-on who supplemented their party lifestyle by burglarizing the homes of famous people. A lesser filmmaker could have turned this story into a broad, dumb comedy or a stern lecture about the morals of today\\u2019s fallen youth. Coppola goes in another direction, capturing the glitz and glamour of this sleek world and its shiny surfaces before exposing the emptiness underneath.Stream it here.\", \"The writer David Mitchell has been a key collaborator of the Wachowski siblings in recent years, working with them on their Netflix series \\u201cSense8\\u201d and co-writing Lana Wachowski\\u2019s recent \\u201cThe Matrix Resurrections.\\u201d But they first worked together less directly, co-writing and co-directing (with the \\u201cRun Lola Run\\u201d filmmaker Tom Tykwer) this 2012 adaptation of Mitchell\\u2019s vast novel \\u201cCloud Atlas.\\u201d It\\u2019s an ambitious piece of work, combining multiple narratives across time and space and placing its main cast (including Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Hugh Grant) in multiple roles. It doesn\\u2019t all work, but it\\u2019s such a big swing that it\\u2019s hard not to fall under its spell.Stream it here.\", \"Clint Eastwood was in a rough spot as a filmmaker in the early 2000s after several years of turning forgotten best-sellers like \\u201cTrue Crime\\u201d and \\u201cBlood Work\\u201d into forgettable movies. But he struck gold in 2003 with his adaptation of \\u201cMystic River,\\u201d a Boston crime novel Dennis Lehane, which netted Oscars for Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. They star, along with Kevin Bacon, as friends since childhood who have dealt with a shared trauma in wildly different ways, and \\u201cMystic River\\u201d expertly folds together its present-day and flashback timelines to reveal how the pain of the past is never far away.Stream it here.\", \"Between their best picture-winning collaboration on \\u201cThe Departed\\u201d and the best picture-nominated \\u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\\u201d the director Martin Scorsese and the star Leonardo DiCaprio teamed up for this 2009 thriller \\u2014 also adapted from a Dennis Lehane novel. It was generally seen as a castoff, a stylistic exercise allowing the filmmaker to play in the moody genre sandbox of the B-movie masters. But there\\u2019s a bleakness to the picture, an existential despair, at which those movies only hinted, particularly in the implications of its shattering closing scenes. DiCaprio shines throughout in a performance of increasing complexity; the more we know about this character, the clearer DiCaprio\\u2019s achievement becomes.Stream it here.\"]","href_hash":"666400c4675711ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"666400c4675711ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
