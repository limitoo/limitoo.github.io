We are for pushing through.\\\"\", \"Morrison, who will submit his proposals to state leaders at a meeting of the national cabinet this week, plans to eventually widen the changes to transport and other key sectors.\", \"Even though Australia was dealing with serious volumes of cases, health systems were coping, Morrison added. More than 3500 people are in hospital, up from about 2000 a week ago.\", \"Data from a Reuters tally showed Australia's infections crossed 1 million on Monday, with more than half in the last week alone.\", \"Supply issues could persist for another three weeks, said supermarket chain Woolworths , where one in five employees is in quarantine.\", \"\\\"At this stage, there is enough product in our supply chain to meet the needs of customers,\\\" Chief Executive Brad Banducci told ABC Radio. \\\"It might not always be their favourite brand, unfortunately.\\\"\", \"Australia's strict border rules are again in the public eye after it cancelled an entry visa for star tennis player Novak Djokovic because of questions about his vaccine exemption.\", \"The judge hearing Djokovic's legal challenge to the decision to revoke his visa aired concerns about the Serbian's treatment by border officials on his arrival.\", \"Health officials warned Monday's figure of just over 67,000 infections could be an \\\"underestimate\\\", as reports from some states do not include those who tested positive in at-home rapid antigen tests. Sunday's tally was just under 100,000.\", \"Total COVID-19 infections in Australia touched 1.04 million since its first case nearly two years ago.\", \"The death toll stands at 2387, though the Omicron wave has caused fewer deaths than previous outbreaks, with 92 percent of those over 16 having received two vaccine doses.\", \"As its booster programme gathers pace, Australia began rolling out from Monday inoculations with Pfizer's vaccines for children aged five to 11.\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"be5fb2ee71ea11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"be5fb2ee71ea11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
