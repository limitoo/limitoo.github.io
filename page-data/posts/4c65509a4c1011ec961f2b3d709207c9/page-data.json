The NBA announced their punishments Monday.\", \"While battling for position on a rebound after a free throw, James's elbow struck Stewart above the eye, opening a cut that caused Stewart to bleed. Stewart got up and bumped chests with James before several other players from the court, referees, and members of both teams came from the sideline to get between the two. Following the initial separation, Stewart attempted to chase after James multiple times, breaking away from teammates and coaches to do so.\", \"James will miss the Lakers game on Tuesday against the New York Knicks in Madison Square Garden, costing him about $284,000 in salary. Stewart will miss one game at home against the Miami Heat on Tuesday, and one road game against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday, shorting the second-year player about $45,000 in salary.\", \"According to the NBA's statement, Stewart was suspended for \\\"escalating an on-court altercation by repeatedly and aggressively pursuing... James in an unsportsmanlike manner.\\\" James's suspension was for \\\"recklessly hitting Stewart in the face and initiating an on-court altercation.\\\"\", \"The Lakers and Pistons play again on Sunday in Los Angeles.

James was suspended one game, and Stewart was suspended two games for their roles in the incident, the NBA announced Monday.</div>\", \"Within 25 seconds of the contact being made by James, there were at least 25 people on the floor. Referee Phenizee Ransom attached himself to James.\", \"Pistons coach Dwane Casey said Stewart needed eight stitches to close the wound, adding that he did not think what Stewart did in reaction to the play merited a suspension.\", \"\\\"His eye got cracked all the way open. He was upset for a reason,\\\" Casey said.\", \"Stewart eventually left the floor, seeming to sprint again as he did so, and there was concern that he would try to head back toward the floor through another entry tunnel. Pistons guard Cory Joseph even headed toward that tunnel, just in case \\u2014 and with the blessing of referee Scott Foster, the game's crew chief.\", \"\\\"After Isaiah Stewart left the court, Cory was anticipating he may come around the back of (the) house and enter the Laker bench from the opposite side,\\\" Foster told a pool reporter after the game. \\\"So, he was going to intercept him. I actually told Cory that would be good.\\\"\", \"Stewart was assessed two technical fouls, James was assessed a Flagrant Foul Penalty 2, and both players were ejected.\", \"James has been sanctioned multiple times by the league in the past, receiving fines for everything from flopping, skipping news conferences and kicking a water bottle.
