But here\\u2019s a collaboration between two sing-rappers, both teenagers, that sounds utterly unforced: Kidd G, who\\u2019s making the kind of naturally syncretic music Nashville should be inching toward, and YNW BSlime, the younger brother of the incarcerated star YNW Melly. Kidd G taps into his Juice WRLD influences, with pitter-patter syllables and scraped-up singing, and YNW BSlime\\u2019s guest verse is chilling, and sung with disarming innocence: \\u201cTwo years my brother\\u2019s been gone/And I\\u2019ve never/felt so alone.\\u201d It sounds like the No. 1 song of 2030. JON CARAMANICA\", \"A peppy song about romantic dyspepsia, \\u201cLight Switch\\u201d is a lightly manqu\\u00e9 version of the sort of electric funk-pop that made Charlie Puth\\u2019s 2018 album \\u201cVoicenotes\\u201d so appealing. The singing is slightly less committed, and the lyric construction not buttoned quite as tight, and there\\u2019s a light hyperpop-esque treatment on the vocals that makes Puth sound like hes lamenting from the inside of the synthesizer. But the anxiety of the words is pointed, and the sugar-rush production scans as breathlessness. CARAMANICA\", \"Escalation suggests obsession in \\u201cMidnight Sun\\u201d from a new Nil\\u00fcfer Yanya album, \\u201cPainless,\\u201d that\\u2019s due in March. \\u201cMaybe I can\\u2019t care too much/I can\\u2019t clean this up,\\u201d she sings. \\u201cGet me off this spinning wheel.\\u201d Both the acoustic guitar chords and the drumbeat feel looped, with more than a hint of Radiohead, but other sounds arrive \\u2014 acoustic and electric guitars \\u2014 sounding hand-played and offering possibilities of escape. It\\u2019s not clear whether she\\u2019ll use them. JON PARELES\", \"The quantum guitar-chord crescendo of grunge \\u2014 quiet-loud-MUCH LOUDER \\u2014 gets a full, furious workout in Gayle\\u2019s \\u201cUr Just Horny,\\u201d the teenage songwriter\\u2019s follow-up to \\u201cAbcdefu.\\u201d As the stop-start guitars stack up, she spells things out: \\u201cYou don\\u2019t wanna be my friend/You just wanna see me naked/Again.\\u201d PARELES\", \"Ecco2K and Bladee are members of the Drain Gang, a Swedish pop collective that has a sideline in fashion modeling. Their latest collaboration, produced by the German musician Mechatok, is a slice of pointillist hyperpop that treats voices and synthesizer tones alike as bits of blipping staccato counterpoint and computer-compressed nuggets of cosmic ambition: \\u201cDestroy and create, dreaming in the dream,\\u201d Bladee croons at the end, before the machines shut off. PARELES\", \"Sofia Kourtesis makes songs that pulsate with the hope of a new day. \\u201cEstaci\\u00f3n Esperanza\\u201d is a master class in culling citations, opening with the chants of a Peruvian protest against homophobia before vocal samples of Manu Chao\\u2019s \\u201cMe Gustas Tu\\u201d glitch into focus, interspersed with vibrant bird calls and a steady horn. When Kourtesis\\u2019 own humming comes into focus, a single moment opens to infinity. ISABELIA HERRERA\", \"The Miami duo INVT lets genres slip through their fingers on its latest track. A fever pitch dembow riddim lifted from Jamaican dancehall thumps to life. A vaporous echo and fleshy moan whisper under the production. There is the steady clang of a cowbell, the shake of a maraca. Is it reggaeton? Minimal techno? Does it even matter? HERRERA\", \"Young Dolph, who was shot and killed in his Memphis hometown in November, had mentored and collaborated with his cousin, Key Glock. Key Glock\\u2019s tribute song, \\u201cProud,\\u201d is the first single from the compilation \\u201cPaper Route Empire Presents: Long Live Dolph,\\u201d and it\\u2019s burly in presentation but the lyrics ache: \\u201cI can get it back in blood but still I can\\u2019t get back the time.\\u201d In the video, Key Glock raps his regrets at the site of the killing, a stark choice. CARAMANICA\", \"John Mellencamp stays grim and grizzled throughout his new album, \\u201cStrictly a One-Eyed Jack.\\u201d In \\u201cI Am a Man That Worries,\\u201d he\\u2019s worried about everything and belligerent about it: \\u201cYou better get out of my way,\\u201d he growls. It\\u2019s a vintage-style blues stop with slide guitar and fiddle flanking his voice, and though he proclaims his bitter solitude, he has a crowd shouting alongside him by the end. PARELES\", \"Nervous energy courses through \\u201cShadow in the Frame,\\u201d the first single from the solo album due in April from Daniel Rossen of Grizzly Bear. Rossen played every instrument except drums (by Grizzly Bear\\u2019s Christopher Bear) in the intricate arrangement, including strings and woodwinds. The song is a meditation on ephemerality and catastrophe \\u2014 \\u201cYou will watch us flash and fade and get torn apart,\\u201d he sings \\u2014 carried by a restless, circling phrase that migrates among guitars and vocals, changing contour but never resolving, hinting at hope that keeps moving out of reach. PARELES\", \"The songwriter Uwade explores infatuation in \\u201cDo You See the Light Around Me?\\u201d It\\u2019s a single on Sylvan Esso\\u2019s label, Psychic Hotline, and as it cycles through four chords with voices and instruments arriving and disappearing, it echoes that group\\u2019s mixture of sparse electronic beats and human warmth. But Uwade brings her own personality, at once uncertain and embracing. PARELES\", \"The Austin-based songwriter Jana Horn keeps her voice small and whispery throughout \\u201cOptimism,\\u201d the debut album she releases this week. \\u201cJordan\\u201d is the album\\u2019s eeriest, most exploratory, most determined song: a steady-pulsing march with electronics at the fringes, an enigmatic biblical narrative about a quest, an ordeal, a dilemma, a revelation. PARELES\", \"The bassist Gui Duvignau begins his take on \\u201cTristeza e Solid\\u00e3o\\u201d \\u2014 a torch song by the Brazilian guitarist Baden Powell and the poet Vin\\u00edcius de Moraes \\u2014 unaccompanied, sounding plangent and contemplative as he lets low notes resound. The guitarist Bill Frisell, featured as a special guest, enters with the drummer Jeff Hirschfield, and trades the song\\u2019s somber melody back and forth with Duvignau. The track is overcast and melancholy and slow, lacking the quiet, motor-like samba groove of Powell\\u2019s and de Moraes\\u2019s original version but sounding just as haunted. This performance comes from Duvignau\\u2019s latest album, \\u201cBaden,\\u201d a tribute to the influential guitarist, who died in 2000. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO\", \"Cumbia rhythms, carried on drums stroked by hands and mallets, lift up a reverb-shaken guitar and the sleepy-eyed voice of Kiko Villamizar. \\u201cSembr\\u00e1 El Ma\\u00edz\\u201d (\\u201cPlant the Corn\\u201d) is an original urging hard work and patience, even in the face of climate catastrophe. By the end he\\u2019s full-throated, trading call-and-response vocals with the band. A musician, educator and organizer now based in Austin, Villamizar grew up primarily on a coffee farm in Colombia and later traveled the country collecting songs. When Los Destellos and Los Wemblers de Iquitos started making Peruvian jungle-surf like this in the 1960s, it rang cosmopolitan; today, writing similar songs, a younger musician from the Colombian side is building on what\\u2019s become a tradition of its own.
