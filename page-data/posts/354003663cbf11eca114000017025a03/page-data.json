For the most part, there's no harm in switching up your dog's diet by adding some fish and seafood to their daily meals.\", \"However, depending on how it's prepared as well as which type of fish or seafood it is, both foods can be toxic\\u2014or in some rare cases, deadly\\u2014for your pooch.\", \"\\\"While poisoning [in fish and seafood] is uncommon, there can be issues with bones or shells causing irritation or potentially obstructions,\\\" Wismer said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Can Dogs Eat Shrimp?</div>\", \"Shrimp can be great for your dog's diet, as they are low in fat, calories as well as carbohydrates, but rich in nutrients that are beneficial for dogs.\", \"The nutrients in shrimp include vitamin B12, niacin (also known as vitamin B3, phosphorus and antioxidants, according to an article at the American Kennel Club (AKC) website.\", \"However, dogs should not be fed raw, uncooked shrimp, as they contain harmful pathogens. The shell should be removed entirely before giving shrimp to your dog, as shells pose a choking hazard and can cause an obstruction, especially for smaller dog breeds, the AKC explains.\", \"Steamed shrimp is the best option for dogs, as the fried or breaded kind contains unnecessary fats and oils that can also be harmful for your pooch.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1921174/shrimp-skewers.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Grilled shrimp on skewers served on a plate.</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Can Dogs Eat Tuna?</div>\", \"The larger the fish and the longer it lives and therefore it will have a higher concentration of mercury in its tissues. Mercury levels are quite high in tuna since they are large, long-living fish.\", \"However, it's not the end of the world if your dog manages to steal a tiny piece of tuna off your plate when you're not looking, as a tiny amount will not cause mercury poisoning, the AKC says.\", \"The risk of mercury poisoning also applies for sharks, swordfish, marlin and king mackerel, Schmid added.\", \"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises orange roughy and tilefish should also be avoided due to their high mercury levels.\", \"Below are some symptoms of mercury poisoning, as outlined by the AKC.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Fish and Seafood Dogs Should Avoid</div>\", \"Here are some types of fish and seafood that can cause problems for your pooch if consumed.\", \"Eating raw forms of salmon, trout and steelhead are among the fish that can pose a risk for dogs.\", \"\\\"Salmon poisoning is a bacterial infection dogs can get if they eat raw salmon, trout or steelhead that is infected with a fluke parasite,\\\" the ASPCA's Wismer said. This is most commonly seen in the northwest region (Washington state, Oregon and northern California).\", \"However, the ingestion of cooked fish does not have that risk, Wismer added.\", \"The Pet Poison Helpline's Schmid explained that salmon poisoning, although rare, can be a concern in dogs that ingest raw salmon \\\"due to the presence of a parasite called Nanophyetus salmincola that's infected with a rickettsia called Neorickettsia heminthoeca.\\\"\", \"This organism causes severe gastrointestinal upset and multi-organ damage, which often leads to death, Schmid warned.\", \"While salmon poisoning is most commonly found in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S., a few cases have also been reported in British Columbia, Canada, she added.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1921177/dog-near-fish-steaks.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A dog standing near a table with seasoned fish steaks. </div>\", \"Several toxins can be found in certain types of fish that are ingested during normal feeding of algae and plankton (such as dinoflagellates). \\\"Fish accumulate these toxins when feeding on affected substances such as algae,\\\" said the Pet Poison Helpline's toxicologist.\", \"A few of the more common toxins include the following, as outlined by Schmid:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1921178/dog-staring-salmon-appetizers.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A dog looking at plate of smoked salmon appetizers. </div>\", \"The Pet Poison Helpline's toxicologist noted it's also important to be aware that some seafood prepared for humans may contain other foods added which are toxic for dogs. For example, onions and garlic can be poisonous to dogs and large amounts of fat (such as butter and cooking oil) can lead to pancreatitis, which is a painful and potentially life threatening illness which affects the intestinal tract.\", \"There are also commercially available diets that contain different types of seafood (particularly salmon) that are often used for dogs and other animals with skin sensitivities or allergies, she added.\", \"\\\"Unless medically necessary, feeding a strictly seafood diet to your dog should be avoided in order to ensure your pet receives the balanced nutrition they need for optimal health,\\\" Schmid said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1921172/tuna-sashimi-plate.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Raw tuna sashimi on a plate.</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Fish and Seafood Dogs Can Eat</div>\", \"All fish can be a healthy part of a well-balanced diet.
