Both counts are felonies, but neither is a murder charge.\", \"Ms. Potter has pleaded not guilty, and her lawyers are expected to argue that the shooting happened accidentally and that she thought she was using her Taser and not her pistol when she pulled the trigger. Prosecutors have not suggested that the shooting was intentional.\", \"The two counts are separate and not mutually exclusive; Ms. Potter can be convicted or acquitted of either charge, or of both.\", \"Minnesota law also allows juries to consider convicting a defendant of an \\u201cincluded offense\\u201d \\u2014 a lesser degree of the same crime, or another lesser crime that was proved in the course of the trial \\u2014 in place of a charge listed in the complaint.\", \"Here are the charges:\", \"One of the ways Minnesota law defines first-degree manslaughter is causing someone\\u2019s death while committing or attempting to commit a lesser crime \\u2014 a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor \\u2014 in a way that a reasonable person could foresee would cause death or great bodily harm.\", \"Specifically, prosecutors accuse Ms. Potter of causing Mr. Wright\\u2019s death through reckless handling or use of a firearm.\", \"First-degree manslaughter is a felony, punishable by up to 15 years\\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of up to $30,000. The standard sentence for someone without a criminal record, like Ms. Potter, would be about seven years.\", \"One of the ways Minnesota law defines second-degree manslaughter is causing someone\\u2019s death through culpable negligence, by creating an unreasonable risk and consciously taking chances of causing death or great bodily harm.\", \"Prosecutors accuse Ms. Potter of doing so while using a firearm.\", \"Second-degree manslaughter is a felony, punishable by up to 10 years\\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of up to $20,000. The standard sentence for a person without any previous convictions would be about four years.\"]","href_hash":"184736a9584411ecbfd25de2a05e4bc5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"184736a9584411ecbfd25de2a05e4bc5"}},
