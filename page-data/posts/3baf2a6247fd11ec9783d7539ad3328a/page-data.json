Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma to grant clemency to a death-row inmate who is scheduled to be executed on Thursday.\", \"The inmate, Julius Jones, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in 2002. He was accused of killing Paul Howell, who was in a car in the driveway of his parents\\u2019 home when he was carjacked and fatally shot in 1999.\", \"Mr. Jones, 41, a former high school basketball player from Oklahoma City, was 19 at the time of the killing, which he says he did not commit. Mr. Howell, a businessman from the suburb of Edmond, was 45.\", \"In September and again this month, the state\\u2019s Pardon and Parole Board recommended that Mr. Jones\\u2019s sentence be commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole, a significant step in a case that has garnered national attention, said Cece Jones-Davis, who directs an Oklahoma-based campaign called Justice for Julius.\", \"But Mr. Jones, his family and his supporters are still waiting to hear whether Mr. Stitt, a Republican, will accept or reject the board\\u2019s recommendation, Ms. Jones-Davis said. Mr. Jones is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection at 4 p.m. on Thursday.\", \"\\u201cWe are hoping and believing and trusting that the governor is still going to do the right thing,\\u201d Ms. Jones-Davis said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut we are coming down to the hour.\\u201d\", \"The Oklahoma City Public Schools estimated that more than 1,800 students across 13 schools had participated in walkouts to support Mr. Jones on Wednesday. The district said that it \\u201csupports our students\\u2019 rights to peaceful assembly and their freedom of expression.\\u201d\", \"At the State House, scores of Mr. Jones\\u2019s supporters prayed, sang and chanted \\u201cfree Julius Jones.\\u201d Madeline Davis-Jones, Mr. Jones\\u2019s mother, told the crowd that her son was innocent.\", \"\\u201cIf my child is executed tomorrow, or any day, it should be without a doubt,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt shouldn\\u2019t be a doubt. Not even a little bit of doubt.\\u201d\", \"A spokeswoman for Mr. Stitt said in an email: \\u201cWe will not have any comments until after the governor has made a decision.\\u201d\", \"If he is executed, Mr. Jones would be the second person put to death by the State of Oklahoma since John Marion Grant, who was convicted of murdering a prison cafeteria worker in 1998, was executed on Oct. 28.\", \"Mr. Grant, 60, was the state\\u2019s first inmate to die by lethal injection since 2015, when Oklahoma stopped executions after using the wrong drug in one instance and allowing a prisoner to regain consciousness in another.\", \"Mr. Grant vomited while shaking for several minutes during the execution, which reporters who have witnessed executions called extremely rare in their experience. But state prison officials said a day after Mr. Grant\\u2019s execution that they did not plan to make any changes to the state\\u2019s lethal injection protocols.\", \"\\u201cI will agree inmate Grant\\u2019s regurgitation was not pleasant to watch,\\u201d Scott Crow, the director of Oklahoma\\u2019s prison system, said at a virtual news conference on Oct. 29. \\u201cBut I do not believe that it was inhumane.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Jones, a Black man who has spent about half of his life in prison, has long maintained his innocence.\", \"\\u201cI did not kill Mr. Howell,\\u201d he wrote in a letter to the parole board in April, after he had exhausted his appeals. \\u201cI did not participate in any way in his murder; and the first time I saw him was on television when his death was reported.\\u201d\", \"But relatives of Mr. Howell, a white man whose sister and two daughters witnessed his killing, have rejected those claims and said that the efforts to grant clemency to Mr. Jones have caused them pain.\", \"\\u201cOur family continues to be victimized by Julius Jones and his lies,\\u201d Mr. Howell\\u2019s brother, Brian Howell, said at a news conference in September.\", \"Mr. Jones and his supporters have argued that his defense lawyers failed him during his trial \\u2014 for instance, by neglecting to question family members who have said that he was having dinner with them at the time of Mr. Howell\\u2019s killing \\u2014 and that prosecutors relied too heavily on the testimony of a co-defendant who said that he had seen Mr. Jones commit the crime.\", \"Mr. Jones\\u2019s supporters have also argued that racism played a role in his trial and sentencing. African Americans make up a disproportionate number of death row prisoners in Oklahoma and in the United States, and research has shown that people convicted of murder are much more likely to be executed if the person who was killed was white.\", \"Mr. Jones\\u2019s appeal for clemency has drawn support from prominent figures in sports, politics and entertainment.\", \"Last month, Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, and Timothy Head, the executive director for the Faith & Freedom Coalition, wrote a letter to Mr. Stitt urging him to commute Mr. Jones\\u2019s sentence.\", \"\\u201cWe believe that doubt about Jones\\u2019s responsibility for the capital crime is not insignificant,\\u201d Mr. Schlapp and Mr. Head wrote.\", \"On Wednesday, Baker Mayfield, a quarterback for the Cleveland Browns, who won the Heisman Trophy as a player for the University of Oklahoma football team, also expressed hope that Mr. Jones would not be executed.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re 24 hours away,\\u201d he told reporters. \\u201cSo it\\u2019s tough. You know, hopefully God can intervene and handle it correctly and do the things he needs to do.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Jones\\u2019s case has been featured in a 2018 documentary series produced by Viola Davis, a podcast episode last year featuring Kim Kardashian West and a recent episode of \\u201cThe Late Late Show With James Corden.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cJulius, his family and everyone on his team are still hopeful Stitt will do the right thing,\\u201d Ms. Kardashian West wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.\"]","href_hash":"3baf2a6247fd11ec9783d7539ad3328a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3baf2a6247fd11ec9783d7539ad3328a"}},
