Telling people how to talk is easy.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-15T18:08:56.000Z","content":"[\"If you follow debates over the strident style of social justice politics often derided as \\u201cwokeness,\\u201d you might have heard about a document called \\u201cAdvancing Health Equity: A Guide to Language, Narrative and Concepts.\\u201d Put out by the American Medical Association and the Association of American Medical Colleges Center for Health Justice, the guide is a long list of terms and phrases that some earnest people have decided others in the medical field should avoid using, along with their preferred substitutes.\", \"Some of these substitutions make sense; health care professionals shouldn\\u2019t be referring to people who\\u2019ve been in prison as \\u201cex-cons.\\u201d Some are a matter of keeping up with the times, like capitalizing Black when talking about Black people. Some, however, are obnoxious and presumptuous and would impede clear communication. For example, the guide suggests replacing \\u201cvulnerable\\u201d with \\u201coppressed,\\u201d even though they\\u2019re not synonymous: it\\u2019s not oppression that makes the elderly vulnerable to Covid.\", \"My guess is that very few people will follow these recommendations. As Conor Friedersdorf points out in The Atlantic, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, still talks about \\u201cthose who are most vulnerable\\u201d when discussing vaccination. \\u201cAdvancing Health Equity\\u201d advises steering clear of words with \\u201cviolent connotation\\u201d like \\u201ccombat\\u201d or \\u201ctarget,\\u201d but last week the president of the American Medical Association gave a speech calling doctors \\u201can army against the virus.\\u201d At one point the document itself critiques how, in health care, diseases \\u201cbecome the main target rather than the social and economic conditions that produce health inequities.\\u201d\", \"Like most other reports written by bureaucratic working groups, \\u201cAdvancing Health Equity\\u201d would probably be read by almost no one if it did not inadvertently advance the right-wing narrative that progressive newspeak is colonizing every aspect of American life. Still, the existence of this document is evidence of a social problem, though not, as the guide instructs us to say instead of \\u201csocial problem,\\u201d a \\u201csocial injustice.\\u201d The problem is this: Parts of the \\u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\\u201d industry are heavy-handed and feckless, and the left keeps having to answer for them.\", \"Consider the endless debate over critical race theory in public schools. In certain circles, it\\u2019s become conventional wisdom that even if public schools are not teaching graduate-school critical race theory, they\\u2019re permeated by something adjacent to it.\", \"\\u201cThe idea that critical race theory is an academic concept that is taught only at colleges or law schools might be technically accurate, but the reality on the ground is a good deal more complicated,\\u201d wrote Yascha Mounk in The Atlantic. Across the nation, he wrote, \\u201cmany teachers\\u201d have started adopting \\u201ca pedagogical program that owes its inspiration to ideas that are very fashionable on the academic left, and that go well beyond telling students about America\\u2019s copious historical sins.\\u201d\", \"In truth it\\u2019s hard to say what \\u201cmany teachers\\u201d are doing; school curriculums are decentralized, and most of the data we have is anecdotal. But there was just a gubernatorial election in Virginia in which critical race theory played a major role. If the right had evidence of Virginia teachers indoctrinating children, you\\u2019d think we\\u2019d have heard about it. After all, school there was almost entirely online last year, offering parents an unprecedented window into what their kids were learning.\", \"Instead, the Republican candidate for governor, Glenn Youngkin, ran commercials featuring a woman aggrieved that her son was assigned Toni Morrison\\u2019s \\u201cBeloved\\u201d as a high school senior. But if conservatives couldn\\u2019t find useful examples from the classroom, they discovered a rhetorical gold mine in materials from a training session for administrators, including a slide juxtaposing \\u201cwhite individualism\\u201d and \\u201ccolor group collectivism.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cTeachers and administrators said that conservative activists had cherry-picked the most extreme materials to try to prove their point,\\u201d The New York Times reported. I\\u2019m sure that\\u2019s true, but it\\u2019s also true that school districts should avoid using training documents that will embarrass them if they\\u2019re made public.\", \"Such training would be worth fighting for if it had a record of success in changing discriminatory behavior, but it doesn\\u2019t. As the scholars Frank Dobbin and Alexandra Kalev wrote in The Economist, hundreds \\u201cof studies of anti-bias training show that even the best programs have short-lived effects on stereotypes and no discernible effect on discriminatory behavior.\\u201d Instead of training sessions, they suggest that employers should focus their diversity efforts on concrete efforts like recruitment.\", \"But substantive change is hard; telling people to use different words is easy. One phrase you won\\u2019t find in \\u201cAdvancing Health Equity\\u201d is \\u201cuniversal health care\\u201d: The American Medical Association has been a consistent opponent of Medicare for All. The word \\u201cabortion\\u201d isn\\u2019t in there either, though it would advance health equity if more doctors were willing to perform one.\", \"In The Washington Post, the columnist Matt Bai described the document as an ominous development. \\u201cI\\u2019d argue that it\\u2019s actually a powerful testament to where we are at the moment \\u2014 and it should frighten you as much as it does me.\\u201d It doesn\\u2019t frighten me: In a truly Orwellian situation, people would actually have to follow new linguistic edicts instead of being able to laugh at them.\", \"But it does irritate me, because it\\u2019s so counterproductive. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not scary, it\\u2019s just ridiculous,\\u201d is not a winning political argument.\"]","href_hash":"0cab6e96468211ecade8c175cd712bf6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0cab6e96468211ecade8c175cd712bf6"}},
