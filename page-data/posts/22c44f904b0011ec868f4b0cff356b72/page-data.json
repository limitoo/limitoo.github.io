William Kelly. Chief Larry Boone and I have concluded Lt. Kelly's actions are in violation of City and departmental policies,\\\" said Norfolk City Manager Chip Filer in a statement in April.\", \"On Friday, Kelly told the Daily Mail he hopes to have a hearing date by the end of January with regards to going back to work. However, he wants to privately handle the matter before then.\", \"Kelly said that he was only fired because he supported Rittenhouse's claim of self-defense.\", \"\\\"If I had a different opinion and I donated to a fund for the victims and made comments about how Mr. Rittenhouse was a murderer, nobody would have cared or tried to get me fired,\\\" Kelly said.\", \"According to the Mail, Kelly might not be able to access his pension if he didn't return to his job. The police officer was reportedly only 10 months away from having his pension after working for almost 20 years at the department.\", \"Kelly said that his opinion about Rittenhouse's self-defense claim doesn't impact his ability to perform his job as a police officer.\", \"\\\"This is America. You can agree with your neighbors and other people in your community and you can disagree with them,\\\" he told the media outlet. \\\"Just because someone has a different opinion than you, it doesn't mean you should destroy their lives, take their job away.\\\"\", \"Kelly made his donation anonymously on the Christian crowdfunding website GiveSendGo after he reportedly found that a GoFundMe fundraiser set for Rittenhouse was taken down. GoFundMe said on Friday that it canceled those accounts because it prohibited \\\"raising money for an alleged violent crime.\\\" But the platform added that it's okay to raise money for Rittenhouse now that he has been acquitted of criminal charges.\", \"Though Kelly's donation on GiveSendGo was anonymous, it was exposed in a data leak that revealed the names of people who donated to the Rittenhouse case, The Guardian reported in April.\", \"Kelly used his department email address to send the donation and left a message on the crowdfunding website in support of the 18-year-old.\", \"\\\"God bless. Thank you for your courage. Keep your head up. You've done nothing wrong. Every rank and file police officer supports you. Don't be discouraged by actions of the political class of law enforcement leadership,\\\" Kelly's message read.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937268/officer-fired-rittenhouse-donation.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A Virginia officer is demanding his job back after being fired over supporting Kyle Rittenhouse now that the teen has been acquitted on Friday.
