I went to Michigan. I fell in love with the place. It is the proudest association I have. And for the first time in 10 years, we beat our biggest rival in the biggest and most-watched college football game of the season. This made me happy.\", \"No, it made me ebullient. Euphoric. This win forced me to look up new words for \\u201chappiness,\\u201d but nothing can capture it. This was an event that had no real impact on my life, and yet it has lifted me to new heights of joy like a hot-air balloon. What\\u2019s the word for that? I have never felt anything like it before.\", \"Obviously, as I am not a member of the Michigan football team, I did not play a single snap of that game. And I watched it from my warm and cozy apartment, rather than in the snowy stands of Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor. But I was so invested in the action that my heart-rate tracker thought I was working out. When the game ended, and Michigan had won, I felt as if I had won, too, from hundreds of miles away.\", \"I am, of course, not the only one who felt this way. A fellow Michigan graduate and current N.F.L. Network host Rich Eisen told me that during the game he felt so personally involved that he turned to his wife and asked, \\u201cWhy does this mean so much to me?\\u201d He said that during previous games, when Michigan was losing to Ohio State, he would have to force himself to take stock of what was good in his life. \\u201cI would often sit there and think to myself, \\u2018I\\u2019ve got a beautiful family, and I\\u2019ve got three healthy children.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"After Saturday\\u2019s win, Eisen was at a loss to describe this particular brand of joy, just as I have been. \\u201cObviously, childbirth and marriages are your best days of your life,\\u201d he told me, not all that convincingly. \\u201cBut this win over Ohio State, I can\\u2019t even really put it into words, and it\\u2019s my job to do that sort of stuff.\\u201d\", \"I wonder, though: Is this happiness \\u2014 the happiness of any fan after a sports victory of such magnitude \\u2014 is it real? After all, I didn\\u2019t actually do anything to help Michigan win. And technically, my life has not materially changed as a result of it.\", \"I put the question to Robert Waldinger, a psychiatrist and professor at Harvard Medical School. He directs the Harvard Study of Adult Development, a longitudinal study that has tracked the physical and mental health of a group of American men for more than 80 years. Dr. Waldinger has thought a lot about the subject of human happiness and gave a TEDx Talk on the subject in 2015 that has been viewed more than 41 million times.\", \"He told me that what I was feeling wasn\\u2019t an illusion. He said that following sports can be as emotionally and physically engaging as watching a thriller or horror movie. Both can induce a state called \\u201cflow,\\u201d which is when you\\u2019re fully absorbed and not thinking about anything else.\", \"\\u201cSome people describe it when they\\u2019re playing a musical instrument. Some people describe it when they\\u2019re skiing down a ski slope where you just have to be totally into going down that slope or you\\u2019ll crash, right? And there\\u2019s something about that flow that\\u2019s very satisfying.\\u201d\", \"He\\u2019s right. During the football game, my mind never left the scene. In fact, during particularly tense sporting events I find it difficult to eat or drink, as my body is also entirely devoted to the task of the game.\", \"But let\\u2019s be clear: The joy of a college football game is not the same as the joy of getting married or having a child. (Or is it?) Dr. Waldinger told me that there were three basic types of happiness. The first is hedonic, which is exactly what it sounds like. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like, \\u2018I\\u2019m happy right now because I\\u2019m drinking a great cup of coffee or I\\u2019m at a good party and I\\u2019m having an interesting conversation.\\u2019\\u201d Or, say, winning a football game after ten years of suffering through losses that have been absolute heartbreak.\", \"Then there\\u2019s eudaimonic well-being. That is the happiness that results from doing something meaningful. Dr. Waldinger said that you could be putting your 2-year-old child to bed, and she wants you to read her \\u201cGood Night Moon\\u201d for the 10th time, and you are exhausted. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the last thing you want to do, but you can\\u2019t think of anything more meaningful than reading to your 2-year-old to help her go to sleep.\\u201d\", \"Finally, there\\u2019s what he called \\u201cpsychological richness,\\u201d a form of happiness in which people value interesting experiences \\u2014 going parasailing, traveling to exotic locations. We all like to have some of each of the three forms of happiness, Dr. Waldinger says, but some of us prioritize some more than others. I think I know where I stand.\", \"I also wanted to know: Could I possibly take my hedonic happiness from Michigan\\u2019s winning a very important football game and make it last?\", \"Unfortunately, the answer is no. No matter how many times I watch replays of the game and bother people who likely do not care with meaningless statistics from the game, i.e., that Hassan Haskins ran for 169 yards and scored five touchdowns.\", \"\\u201cHappiness is a transient phenomenon,\\u201d Dr. Waldinger told me. We all know this to be true, of course, despite my hope that it might not always be. And we don\\u2019t even know sometimes why we feel good one minute and terrible the next.\", \"Then Dr. Waldinger tosses me a bone. \\u201cThere are ways to prolong that feeling,\\u201d he says. He suggests surrounding yourself with good people and environments that you like to be in. But that\\u2019s the best he can do. There are limits to our control. \\u201cThere are no ways to say, \\u2018I\\u2019m going to make this happiness last for two hours longer,\\u2019\\u201d he says. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think we can do that.\\u201d\", \"I told him, \\u201cI wish we could,\\u201d and he laughed, saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t we all.\\u201d\", \"But perhaps there is a form of happiness I can hold onto \\u2014 one focused on the happiness of other people. Dr. Waldinger didn\\u2019t mention it, but there is a Hebrew word, firgun, that basically means experiencing genuine joy at someone else\\u2019s accomplishment. And that\\u2019s a feeling I\\u2019ve been having a lot this week \\u2014 pure delight for the Michigan team. For the players who got a lot of attention and accolades afterward, and the players who didn\\u2019t but still took part in every workout, every game, every play, every effort to do something that hadn\\u2019t been done by a Michigan football team since 2011.\", \"After the victory, as students and fans rushed onto the field at Michigan Stadium, the players joined in the celebration, posing for photographs and hugging each other as snow swirled around them. I might as well have been right there with them. And a week later, the skies still seem bluer, the annoying people in life less annoying, and life is just \\u2026 better.\"]","href_hash":"55f4b6e7552011ec8d63bd6e74010dc4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"55f4b6e7552011ec8d63bd6e74010dc4"}},
