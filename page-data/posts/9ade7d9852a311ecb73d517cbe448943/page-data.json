Mark T. Vande Hei posted the images to his Twitter feed and challenged his followers to find Earth's highest peak in them.\", \"Some of Vande Hei's followers responded that they had indeed been able to spot Everest, the peak of which reaches 29,035 feet above sea level, in the images captured by the astronaut from his vantage point over 1.3 million feet (248 miles) above our planet.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943079/earth-space-iss.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">An image of Earth taken from the ISS by NASA astronaut Mark T. Vande Hei. The image represents Vande Hei's first image of mt Everest which he challenged followers to spot. </div>\", \"Twitter user Steve Rice said that he was able to spot Everest in the images thanks to a little help from Google maps. Other followers weren't able to spot the mountain, part of the Himalayas, a mountain range that covers 75 percent of Nepal, but congratulated Vande Hei on his stunning images.\", \"Though marking a personal achievement for Vande Hei, this isn't the first time that an astronaut aboard the ISS has managed to capture an image of Earth's highest mountain peak.\", \"In March 2002, astronaut Daniel Bursch, a member of the Expedition 4 crew, caught a stunning image of Mt. Everest from the ISS. The image showed early morning light shining on the eastern Kangshung Face.\", \"In his 120 day report to Mission Control, Bursch described how he came to capture the image: \\\"One morning I happened to be up early. I glanced at our world map and saw that we'd be passing near Mt. Everest soon. I checked the computer, realized that we were in an attitude that would allow me to open the window shutter and there was Mt. Everest!\", \"\\\"It almost seemed to jump out at me. The low sun angle it was close to orbital sunrise gave tremendous relief to the mountains. It was just one of those sights that will be forever burned into my brain!\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942998/mt-everest-space.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">An image of Mount Everest taken from the ISS in 2002 by Dan Bursch. </div>\", \"More recently, Russian cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Ryazansky captured stunning images of Mt Everest from the ISS.

Since then some images have been taken from the ISS by astronaut Leroy Chiao that show at least some small sections of the wall.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943045/iss-orbit-around-earth.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A image shows the International Space Station in orbit around Earth.
