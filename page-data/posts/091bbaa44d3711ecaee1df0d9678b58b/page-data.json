It\\u2019s an extension of the operator\\u2019s arm,\\u201d she said. \\u201cReaching out and clawing back, making marks and movements, laying down materials and sweeping them back up \\u2014 it resonates for me as an artist too.\\u201d\", \"LaTocha had some familiarity with this site. She had retrieved rubble and debris from the excavation\\u2019s edge to use in making her large-scale installation currently on view at BRIC House, a nonprofit arts space right across the street.\", \"Once mainly a painter, LaTocha, 52, now operates in a vein all her own, somewhere between painting and environmental art. Her works are made on sturdy, resin-coated photographic paper that she lays out on the floor, often at such large scale that she must crawl across them in the studio. She repeatedly pours and spreads pools of ink as well as heaps of soil and materials that she lets settle and pervade the surface, then scrapes and sweeps away.\", \"Lately, she has added volume in the form of sheets of lead that partially overlay the main surface: They are crinkled like tinfoil, the result of working them by hand over rock formations, imprinting every fissure and striation.\", \"The works present as stormy, earth-toned abstractions, but they are deeply site-responsive, their ingredients gathered in New Mexican mesas, Ozarks bluffs, Louisiana wetlands.\", \"Now she has turned her attention to New York City and the geological and human forces that have shaped its terrain. Her 55-foot installation at BRIC, titled \\u201cIn the Wake Of\\u2026,\\u201d and a companion piece in the Greater New York exhibition now at MoMA P.S.1, also involve soil from Green-Wood Cemetery and imprints of Manhattan schist bedrock striated by glaciers.\", \"LaTocha\\u2019s technique extends landscape painting yet it is not, in any conventional sense, landscape painting at all. \\u201cShe takes the earth itself and paints with the attributes of the planet,\\u201d said the artist Howardena Pindell, who taught her in the M.F.A. program at Stony Brook University in the mid-00s and remains a friend. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a great leap forward for landscape.\\u201d\", \"It reflects, as well, deep communion with the land. LaTocha spends long hours in the sites that inspire her work, photographing, recording ambient sound, reflecting.\", \"That immersion shows in the art, said Ruba Katrib, the MoMA P.S.1 curator: \\u201cIt\\u2019s hands-on, not like this distant viewing eye. It\\u2019s actually in the landscape, touching it, embedded in it.\\u201d\", \"LaTocha has roots in American expanses: She grew up in Alaska, and on her mother\\u2019s side she is Lakota and Ojibwe from the Northern Plains. But she resided mostly in New York City since graduating from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in the early \\u201990s and is now based in Peekskill, N.Y., where she has a studio large enough to make her monumental works.\", \"She remembers Downtown Brooklyn before the current development boom. But her take on the changes, far from nostalgic, emphasizes the much longer view. \\u201cI see what humans are doing,\\u201d she said. But research for the work had led her into \\u201cthe history of New York, of the Lenape, and going back to pre-human times.\\u201d\", \"Soil from Green-Wood, for instance, which the cemetery excavates to make space for new graves, is inherently connected to the city\\u2019s social history. But it is also some of the last undisturbed soil from an earlier epoch. \\u201cWhere else can you get earth from predevelopment time?\\u201d she said.\", \"The cemetery rests, as well, on heights formed by the Ice Age terminal moraine, while the bedrock schist she imprinted dates even deeper in geological time. She carried 40-pound rolls of lead into a Manhattan park and meticulously captured the intricacies of the rock face. \\u201cYou get very intimately connected with the detail,\\u201d she said.\", \"LaTocha\\u2019s telescoped material history registers the onward march of human activity but also what existed long before. Another current presentation, at the Visual Arts Center of New Jersey, in Summit, N.J., applies the same methods to engage with the Great Falls of the Passaic River in Paterson, a natural site that powered much of that city\\u2019s industrial history.\", \"At BRIC, she has incorporated an audio component, made with the sound artist Maria Ch\\u00e1vez, mixing recorded subway rumbles, construction hubbub and phases of silence. The entire installation \\u201chelps us very urban people to take a step back,\\u201d said Elizabeth Ferrer, BRIC\\u2019s vice president for contemporary art, who organized it with the curator Jenny Gerow. \\u201cIt makes you think: what is that ground underfoot?\\u201d\", \"LaTocha traces her fascination with the land to her Alaska childhood. Her father worked for the forestry department and built a home outside Anchorage on \\u201ca dirt road off a dirt road,\\u201d she said. The nearby mountainside offered sweeping views. \\u201cYou were surrounded by immense depth, vast space, and incredible heights.\\u201d\", \"Her undergraduate art-school education was formally rich and varied, she said. But it offered little exposure to critical views on the American landscape tradition in painting and photography and its involvement in ideologies of Westward expansion and settlement.\", \"\\u201cHere are these guys going into the West with these massive mammoth plates,\\u201d she said of 19th-century photographers. \\u201cThen you start learning other histories, questioning roles and responsibilities. That pushed the urgency to expand my thinking.\\u201d\", \"Around 10 years ago, she put away oils and brushes for good in favor of her inks and environmental materials, which include tire shreds and other improvised tools to move substances across the paper. The turn has been fruitful, garnering critical interest, major residencies \\u2014 the Rauschenberg Foundation in 2013, the Joan Mitchell Foundation in 2016 \\u2014 and exhibition momentum after years of working odd jobs.\", \"Katrib, the Greater New York curator, said LaTocha\\u2019s work expressed the \\u201cidea of deep time\\u201d that runs through that exhibition. It is also timeless in how it envelops viewers, said Manuela Well-Off-Man, the chief curator of the IAIA Museum of Contemporary Native Arts in Santa Fe, N.M., comparing the effect to Mark Rothko or Anselm Kiefer: \\u201cIt triggers some sort of experience from very deep back.\\u201d\", \"LaTocha\\u2019s emergence parallels the rise of Native contemporary art as a field working out curatorial priorities and the ways it is represented. She has exhibited in that context, including a notable group show of Native artists since the 1950s at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, in 2018, but remains \\u201cconflicted,\\u201d she said, about being labeled by an identity category.\", \"At the same time, she said, exhibition projects on the Pine Ridge reservation with the Lakota educator Craig Howe strengthened connection with her roots. \\u201cIt was a great opportunity to spend more time with those stories, to reflect and visualize.\\u201d\", \"The painter Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, who is 81, observed that her own generation was conditioned to self-censor Native artistic references, while young artists now find them widely appreciated, leaving LaTocha\\u2019s generation somewhere in between.\", \"Still, said Smith, who curated LaTocha\\u2019s show at the CUE Art Foundation in 2015, she found the work consistent with a distinctly Native approach to landscape: \\u201cIt\\u2019s a holistic view,\\u201d she said. \\u201cSo often the sky and land are merged, there\\u2019s no delineation, and she does that well.\\u201d\", \"In Brooklyn, LaTocha rounded out a tour of field sites at Green-Wood, beginning in the maintenance area, with its mounds of rocks and soil from recent digging, and proceeding to the heights with its panoramic view of the city.\", \"Next year, she will present a series of installations in the cemetery itself. \\u201cSo much of the work we do here is about the residents who are buried,\\u201d said Harry Weil, Green-Wood\\u2019s director of public programs. \\u201cWe never think, what about before [the cemetery\\u2019s founding in] 1838? And then thousands of years before humans were in the area?\\u201d\", \"Looking across to Lower Manhattan, LaTocha shared her memories of 9/11, when she was close to the horror. Recently, she said, she had a residency in the new 4 World Trade Center building. Sunsets viewed from there, she said, could feel like the world was aflame.\", \"And perhaps it was, she added, as our relationship to the planet hurtles toward a climate showdown. \\u201cNot to be gloom-and-doom, but it\\u2019s a possibility,\\u201d she said. \\u201cDepending on the choices that we make.\\u201d\", \"Where to See Athena LaTocha\\u2019s Works\"]","href_hash":"091bbaa44d3711ecaee1df0d9678b58b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"091bbaa44d3711ecaee1df0d9678b58b"}},
