That's no longer an acceptable measure of success.\", \"\\\"We're still losing more than 650 women to breast cancer every year, and our comprehensive review of the register data shows our M\\u0101ori, Pasifika and younger women, and those with larger or more aggressive cancers, are being left behind.\", \"\\\"On top of this, Covid-19's devastating impact on breast screening is putting even more women at risk.
