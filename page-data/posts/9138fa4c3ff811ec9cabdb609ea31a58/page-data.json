Just one revelation among many, many others.\", \"Bartlett shares his concerns with the metaverse and says our law must be able to regulate something like a virtual world.\", \"\\\"Who gets to set the rules? Who enforces the rules? A lot of people just assume that it would just be the technology companies themselves who would enforce the rules and that's incredibly concerning,\\\" he says.\", \"Because Meta isn't the only company looking at virtual worlds.\", \"Just last week, Microsoft also announced its move into the metaverse, saying its apps like Teams would allow workers to virtually share the same space as their colleagues from all over the world.\", \"Online game Fortnite isn't just used for its original purpose anymore, its 200 million users can log online just to talk to each other and even go to concerts. Artists like Ariana Grande have performed inside Fortnite - something Bartlett says is a \\\"pared-down\\\" version of the metaverse.\", \"\\\"It's not as simple as, it's a good thing or a bad thing,\\\" he says.\", \"\\\"It's like other kinds of new technology, I think it's neutral and then what people do with it can be really good or really bad.
