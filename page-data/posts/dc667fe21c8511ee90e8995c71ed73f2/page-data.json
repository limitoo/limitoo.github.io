It is important to stress at this point independent does not mean neutral,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"As a country, we may be small, but we are not bystanders. We chart our own course, with decisions that are in our national interest.\\\"\", \"That is an approach which has been applied particularly to China, which he described as \\\"our most complex\\\" relationship.\", \"\\\"Reports emerged just before my trip of a robust conversation between our Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta and the Chinese Foreign Minister. You might have noticed we didn't deny that,\\\" Hipkins said.\", \"\\\"Our approach has always been that we are consistent in asserting our interests, we are predictable as we advance our values and we are respectful as we engage in our relationship with China. A strong, mature and complex relationship means we will have those tough conversations.\", \"\\\"Putting up walls and closing doors doesn't serve us well in the long term and engagement is always preferable to isolation.\\\"\", \"He acknowledged the recent AUKUS grouping - Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States - and continued the position of saying New Zealand would not take part in it - or at least, the nuclear submarine aspect.\", \"\\\"We understand the strategic drivers for AUKUS, and those partners know that New Zealand's nuclear free position is proudly long standing and it's not going to change,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We will not be part of the AUKUS nuclear submarine arrangement, and the partners in the AUKUS arrangement understand and respect that.\\\"\", \"Bringing his speech to an end, he paid tribute to former Labour prime ministers Peter Fraser, Norman Kirk, and Helen Clark, saying New Zealand needed to embrace their \\\"legacy of principled independence\\\" in contributing to shaping the international environment.\", \"\\\"The choices we make, how we exert our influence, and how we project our voice, all matter. It means being neither naive, nor fatalistic about the challenges we face.\", \"\\\"I believe we're the best little country in the world. I'm proud of our foreign policy heritage and I'm committed to continuing our legacy on the world stage as a force for good.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"dc667fe21c8511ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dc667fe21c8511ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
