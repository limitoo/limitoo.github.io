The charges include enticing a minor to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity and transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity.\", \"Here are some takeaways from the first day of the trial:\", \"In describing how evidence would show that Ms. Maxwell helped Mr. Epstein traffic and sexually abuse teenage girls, a prosecutor sketched out the story of one accuser referred to only by a first name, Jane.\", \"Jane met Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell in 1994, the prosecutor, Lara Pomerantz, told jurors: a seemingly innocent encounter that began at a picnic table with the realization that the two adults and the teenage girl all lived in Palm Beach, Fla. It ended with Jane providing her phone number.\", \"That was the \\u201cbeginning of a nightmare that would last for years,\\u201d Ms. Pomerantz said. She said that Ms. Maxwell helped win Jane\\u2019s trust with shopping trips and \\u201chelped normalize abusive sexual conduct\\u201d at the hands of Mr. Epstein.\", \"The jury would hear directly from Jane and from three other women who had similar experiences as teenage girls, the prosecutor said.\", \"A few minutes later, however, a defense lawyer, Bobbi C. Sternheim, told jurors that recollections from witnesses like Jane, who are expected to testify under oath about Mr. Epstein\\u2019s abuse, were not to be trusted.\", \"She suggested the accusers had \\u201cunreliable and suspect\\u201d memories that could have been \\u201ccorrupted\\u201d over the years or \\u201ccontaminated\\u201d by \\u201cconstant media reports.\\u201d She also suggested the accusers were motivated by a desire to win \\u201ca big jackpot of money\\u201d from a possible civil action against Mr. Epstein\\u2019s estate.\", \"\\u201cEach accuser\\u2019s story is thin,\\u201d she told jurors. \\u201cThey have been impacted by lawyers, by media, by things they have read and things they have heard and by money, big bucks.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Sternheim painted Ms. Maxwell as a \\u201cscapegoat\\u201d who is on trial only because Mr. Epstein had killed himself in a federal jail. That suicide, she told jurors, left \\u201ca gaping hole in the pursuit of justice\\u201d for many people. Ms. Maxwell is \\u201cfilling that hole,\\u201d Ms. Sternheim added. \\u201cFilling that empty chair.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cEver since Eve was accused of tempting Adam with the apple,\\u201d she said, \\u201cwomen have been blamed for the bad behavior of men.\\u201d\", \"The first witness for the prosecution was not one of the accusers but a private pilot: Lawrence Paul Visoski Jr., who had worked for Mr. Epstein from 1991 to 2019.\", \"Mr. Visoski described, in broad strokes, the role Ms. Maxwell played in managing Mr. Epstein\\u2019s households and properties, describing their relationship as \\u201ccouple-ish.\\u201d Guided by photographs presented as evidence, Mr. Visoski also described ferrying Mr. Epstein and his guests to various luxury residences in New York City; Paris; the U.S. Virgin Islands; Palm Beach, Fla.; and Santa Fe, N.M.\", \"\\u201cPretty much every four days we were on the road flying somewhere,\\u201d he said.
