Negotiations had largely focused on a two-tiered wage structure that gives workers hired after 2015 less pay and fewer benefits than veteran workers. The latest rejected contract offer would have placed workers who had been at the company for at least four years into the veteran worker category.\", \"The Kellogg Company has indicated that it is not interested in another round of negotiating for a new contract, saying that \\\"there is no further bargaining scheduled and we have no plans to meet\\\" with the striking workers. The company argued that its \\\"focus must continue to be on executing the next phase of our contingency plan\\\" because \\\"the strike will continue.\\\"\", \"Temporary Kellogg's workers have been crossing the picket line to fill the labor shortage amid the strike. The company first indicated that it planned to replace some of those on strike permanently last month, not long after suing striking workers for allegedly intimidating their temporary replacements and blocking plant entrance in Omaha.\", \"The process for finding permanent replacements for what the company described as \\\"great jobs\\\" has been quickly met with complications.
