But we have seen batteries that have acted in a way that potentially could cause [injury],\\\" he said.\", \"Improper care and maintenance could potentially harm devices.\", \"In particular, it could be dangerous to charge vapes from wall sockets when they are designed for lower power sockets such as computer USB ports.\", \"It was also important for consumers to be sure a device was switched off before being placed in pockets, although most devices were now equipped with an automatic killswitch, Curtis said.\", \"He encouraged people to buy vapes from reputable, brick and mortar retailers and follow salespeople's advice for care and maintenance of products.\", \"Vapo George St manager Malcolm Lee said overheating vapes were rare. He had only seen one in his year at the store. It involved a customer bringing in a device, bought elsewhere, that was firing in his pocket, potentially because it was faulty, Lee said.\", \"His store had also noted two \\\"very, very minor\\\" reactions to propylene glycol, a common ingredient in vape juice.\", \"- This story was first published on the Otago Daily Times website\"]","href_hash":"9d858608732911ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9d858608732911ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
