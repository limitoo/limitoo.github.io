But, having engineered the crisis by surrounding Ukraine with forces from the north, east and south, Moscow is now citing the Western response as evidence to support its narrative that Russia is the target, not the instigator, of aggression.\", \"Denmark, Spain, France and the Netherlands were all planning or considering sending troops, planes or ships to eastern Europe, NATO said. Ukraine shares borders with four NATO countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania.\", \"\\\"The United States has also made clear that it is considering increasing its military presence in the eastern part of the Alliance,\\\" it said.\", \"U.S. officials said the Pentagon was finalising efforts to identify specific units that could deploy.\", \"The United States is considering sending thousands of additional troops to NATO's eastern flank, two U.S. officials told Reuters.

All this leads to the fact that tensions are growing,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"This is not happening because of what we, Russia, are doing. This is all happening because of what NATO and the U.S. are doing and due to the information they are spreading.\\\"\", \"Global stock markets skidded as the prospect of a Russian attack quashed demand for riskier assets such as bitcoin, and bolstered the dollar and oil. The rouble hit a 14-month low against the dollar, and Russian stocks and bonds tumbled.\\u00a0\", \"Russia has used its troop build-up to draw the West into discussions after presenting demands to redraw Europe's security map. It wants NATO never to admit Ukraine and to pull back troops and weapons from former Communist countries in eastern Europe that joined it after the Cold War.\", \"Washington says those demands are non-starters but is ready to discuss other ideas on arms control, missile deployments and confidence-building measures.\", \"Russia is awaiting a written U.S. response this week after talks last Friday - the fourth round this month - produced no breakthrough.\", \"Asked whether he thought an invasion was imminent, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told broadcasters that intelligence was \\\"pretty gloomy on this point\\\" but that \\\"sense can still prevail.\\\"\", \"He repeated Western warnings that invading Ukraine would be \\\"a painful, violent and bloody business\\\" for Russia.\\u00a0\", \"The United States and the European Union, wary of Russia's intentions since it seized Crimea and backed separatists fighting government forces in eastern Ukraine in 2014, have told Russia it will face crippling penalties if it attacks again.\", \"EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels warned Russia it would face \\\"massive\\\" consequences, but are divided over how tough to be on Moscow and did not say what the consequences might be.\\u00a0\", \"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told EU President Charles Michel by phone that it was important for Kyiv that the EU showed unity.\", \"\\\"Ukraine will not fall for provocations, and together with its partners, will remain calm and restrained,\\\" his office said.\", \"The European Commission, the EU executive body, proposed a 1.2-billion euro ($1.36-billion) financial aid package to help Ukraine mitigate the effects of the conflict with Russia.\\u00a0\", \"A Russian delegation source said political advisers from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany would meet in Paris on Wednesday for talks on resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine, in which some 15,000 people have been killed since 2014.
