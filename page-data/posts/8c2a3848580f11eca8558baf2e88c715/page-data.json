And unions for electricians and steelworkers are rallying behind President Biden\\u2019s climate and social policy legislation, now in the Senate\\u2019s hands.\", \"But at least one group of workers appears far less enthusiastic about the deal-making: coal workers, who continue to regard clean-energy jobs as a major risk to their standard of living.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s definitely going to pay less, not have our insurance,\\u201d Gary Campbell, a heavy-equipment operator at a coal mine in West Virginia, said of wind and solar jobs. \\u201cWe see windmills around us everywhere. They\\u2019re up, then everybody disappears. It\\u2019s not consistent.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden has sought to address the concerns about pay with subsidies that provide incentives for wind and solar projects to offer union-scale wages. His bill includes billions in aid, training money and redevelopment funds that will help coal communities.\", \"But Phil Smith, the top lobbyist for the United Mine Workers of America, said a general skepticism toward promises of economic relief was nonetheless widespread among his members. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve heard the same things over and over and over again going back to J.F.K.,\\u201d Mr. Smith said. The union has been pointedly mum on the current version of Mr. Biden\\u2019s bill, which the president is calling Build Back Better.\", \"Unfortunately for Mr. Biden, this skepticism has threatened to undermine his efforts on climate change. While there are fewer than 50,000 unionized coal miners in the country, compared with the millions of industrial and construction workers who belong to unions, miners have long punched above their weight thanks to their concentration in election battleground states like Pennsylvania or states with powerful senators, like Joe Manchin III of West Virginia.\", \"When Mr. Manchin, a Democrat and one of the chamber\\u2019s swing votes, came out against Mr. Biden\\u2019s $150 billion clean electricity program in October, his move effectively killed what many environmentalists considered the most critical component of the president\\u2019s climate agenda. The miners\\u2019 union applauded.\", \"And Mr. Manchin and his constituents will continue to exert outsize influence over climate policy. Mr. Biden\\u2019s roughly $2 trillion bill includes about $550 billion in spending on green technology and infrastructure. Even if the bill passes largely intact, most experts say future government action will be necessary to stave off the catastrophic effects of global warming.\", \"All of that has raised the stakes for courting coal miners.\", \"\\u201cOur guiding principle is the belief that we don\\u2019t have to choose between good jobs and a clean environment,\\u201d said Jason Walsh, the executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which has united labor and environmental groups to marshal support for initiatives like Mr. Biden\\u2019s. \\u201cBut our ability to continue to articulate that belief with a straight face depends on the policy choices we make.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cCoal miners,\\u201d he added, \\u201care at the center of that.\\u201d\", \"It is impossible to explain mine workers\\u2019 jaundiced view of Mr. Biden\\u2019s agenda without appreciating their heightened economic vulnerability: Unlike the carpenters and electricians who work at power plants but could apply their skills to renewable-energy projects, many miners are unlikely to find jobs on wind and solar farms that resemble their current work. (Some, like equipment operators, have more transferable skills.)\", \"It is also difficult to overstate the political gamesmanship that has shaped the discourse on miners. In her 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton proposed spending $30 billion on economic aid for coal country. But a verbal miscue \\u2014 \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,\\u201d she said while discussing her proposal at a town hall \\u2014 allowed opponents to portray her as waging a \\u201cwar on coal.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt is a politicized situation in which one political party that\\u2019s increasingly captured by industry benefits from the status quo by perpetuating this rhetoric,\\u201d said Matto Mildenberger, a political scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies the politics of climate policy.\", \"And then there is Mr. Manchin, a complicated political figure who is among the Senate\\u2019s leading recipients of campaign money from the fossil fuel industry.\", \"Mr. Manchin has sometimes resisted provisions favored by the miners\\u2019 union, such as wage-replacement payments to coal workers who must accept a lower-paying job. \\u201cAt the end of the day, it wasn\\u2019t something he was interested in doing,\\u201d said Mr. Smith, the union\\u2019s lobbyist. A spokeswoman for Mr. Manchin declined to comment.\", \"Yet in other ways Mr. Manchin has channeled his constituents\\u2019 feelings well, suggesting that he might be more enthusiastic about renewable-energy legislation if they were.\", \"At a forum in the spring, he talked about the tendency to forget coal miners \\u2014 \\u201cWe feel like the returning Vietnam veteran,\\u201d he said \\u2014 and questioned the proposed trade of \\u201cthe traditional jobs we\\u2019re about to lose, for the transitional jobs that I\\u2019m not sure are going to be there.\\u201d\", \"In interviews, coal workers said they were skeptical that Mr. Biden\\u2019s spending plan would ultimately benefit them. Mr. Campbell, a recording secretary for his union local, said he would be pleased if an electric-vehicle battery plant opened in West Virginia under a manufacturing tax credit pending in Congress.\", \"But he doubted it would happen. \\u201cUntil something gets done, I don\\u2019t want to jump on anyone\\u2019s coattail,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve had a lot of promises, that\\u2019s about it.\\u201d\", \"Dustin Tingley, an expert on public opinion on climate policy at Harvard University, said that while investments in green technology were popular among the general public, many coal country residents simply didn\\u2019t believe these investments would produce jobs in their communities over the long term.\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re some 35-year-old, 40-year-old worker in fossil fuels thinking about transitioning to some new industry, you need to have the expectation that the jobs will actually be around,\\u201d Dr. Tingley said.\", \"The clean-energy bill that Illinois passed in September illustrates the tension. The legislation allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and ensures that construction workers will receive union-scale wages on most nonresidential projects. It also includes tens of millions of dollars for worker training.\", \"But Doris Turner, a Democratic state senator from central Illinois whose district includes a coal-powered plant and mine workers, said she had voted \\u201cpresent\\u201d rather than \\u201cyea\\u201d on the bill because of lingering concerns about workers.\", \"Ms. Turner, a first-term senator who helped win a concession to extend the life of the local coal plant, said she sometimes felt like the Joe Manchin of Illinois. \\u201cI\\u2019m trying to build relationships with new colleagues, and all of a sudden here we are with this energy legislation and I\\u2019m like, \\u2018I can\\u2019t do that,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Turner said. \\u201cNobody was very rude, but I could hear sighs.\\u201d\", \"Pat Devaney, the secretary-treasurer of the Illinois A.F.L.-C.I.O., who was involved in negotiating the bill, said coal workers presented the most vexing policy dilemma.\", \"\\u201cThat one is a little bit tougher of a nut to crack,\\u201d he said, adding that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and other labor groups would continue to push for proposals like health benefits and lost-wage compensation for displaced workers, programs that didn\\u2019t make it into the recently enacted Illinois law.\", \"Such delays in economic relief are typical and have heightened miners\\u2019 opposition to clean-energy legislation, said Heidi Binko, executive director of the Just Transition Fund, a nonprofit group focused on growing local economies hit hard by the decline of fossil fuels.\", \"Ms. Binko cited the example of the Obama administration, which in 2014 proposed an ambitious regulatory effort to reduce carbon emissions that appeared likely to accelerate the closing of coal-fired plants. The administration later unveiled an economic development package for coal country \\u2014 after voters there had already become alarmed.\", \"\\u201cIt would have been received so differently if first the administration had done something to help the people left behind,\\u201d Ms. Binko said.\", \"Private philanthropists have often reinforced the problem, Ms. Binko said, by spending millions on campaigns to shut down coal plants, but little on economic development that would ease the political opposition to renewable energy in states like West Virginia.\", \"Carrie Doyle, a senior fellow in the environment program of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which makes grants to organizations working on climate change, said philanthropists were only beginning to address the shortfall in funding for economic development.\", \"\\u201cIt feels like it should have been put into place a while ago,\\u201d Ms. Doyle said. \\u201cSome of that funding is happening now, but it needs to scale.\\u201d\", \"While such efforts will come too late to ease the passage of Mr. Biden\\u2019s climate legislation, they could be essential to ensuring that renewable energy remains politically viable.\", \"Some scholars point to international trade as a cautionary tale. In the 1990s and 2000s, Congress approved multiple trade deals. Economists argued, as they do on renewable energy today, that the benefits to the country would far outweigh the costs, which would be concentrated among a small group of workers who could be compensated for their losses, or find new jobs for similar pay.\", \"But the failure to ease the economic blow to manufacturing workers, who many economists now concede were devastated by greater trade with China, helped unravel political support for free trade. In 2016, both major presidential nominees campaigned against the 12-nation trade pact that the Obama administration had spent years negotiating.\", \"If displaced fossil fuel workers go through a comparable experience, these scholars say, the political effects could be similar, unraveling support for climate policies.\", \"\\u201cThere are lessons to be learned from that experience,\\u201d said Dr. Tingley, speaking of the fallout from trade. Among them, he added, \\u201cwas just recognizing how hard it is to pivot, given where people are in life.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8c2a3848580f11eca8558baf2e88c715"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8c2a3848580f11eca8558baf2e88c715"}},
