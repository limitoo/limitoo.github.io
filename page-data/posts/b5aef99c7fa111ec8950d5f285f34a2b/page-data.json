Actually it's more like children's light entertainment, in which ageing cricketers pit their skills against rugby players.\", \"It's not a great advertisement for cricket or cricketers, but it is immensely popular.\", \"A crowd of more than 10,000 packed into Bay Oval, where the fun and amber liquid appeared to flow in equal measure. In the end it was hard to know if the fans were more intoxicated by alcohol or the chance to perform for the camera. Either way, the atmosphere became increasingly frenzied as the evening wore on.\", \"People watching at home might've been a bit confused by the commentary. Some would have expected a professional, even competent, job and potentially came away disappointed.\", \"In fairness, it just catered to the lowest common denominator in the same way as the event itself did.\", \"I mention all this in contrast to the way Ross Taylor's test cricket career ended a few days earlier.\", \"Rather than a cast of thousands, a few dozen people were on hand at Hagley Oval to farewell one of New Zealand's all-time greats.\", \"Taylor, who barely rates as a part-time bowler, took the final wicket of the match - just the third of his 112-test career - to give the whole thing a tidy postscript.\", \"I'm tempted to ask what were the odds of that happening. But, given the historical connections between the Bangladesh cricket players and bookmakers, perhaps it's best not to.\", \"You could wonder if New Zealand Cricket (NZC) might have done more to celebrate Taylor's career. I know people have said to me that they all found the whole thing a bit flat.\", \"In truth, Taylor is a modest - occasionally awkward - kind of guy and fanfare just isn't his thing. Some athletes want everything to be about them, but Taylor is not one of them.\", \"Overall, though, I'd wager the two matches would send a shiver down the spine of sports administrators.\", \"The Black Clash is staged by a promotions company. Yes, most of the events they put on are sports-related, but they are pure entertainment.\", \"The action itself is very much secondary to the carnival going on around it.\", \"Problem is, though, that it's now a beloved part of the sporting calendar. People queue up to attend in person, athletes are happy to be involved, television audiences are strong and fans enjoy talking about it in the days that follow.\", \"Traditional sporting events in this country are dull. They lack colour and personality and excitement.\", \"Administrators still think the game itself is enough for fans, but it's not.\", \"I personally don't care for the Black Clash. I felt embarrassed when it was on the other night.\", \"Embarrassed for some of the fans - who were coaxed into acting up for the camera - embarrassed for the players who had to pal around with the television presenters and embarrassed for cricket.\", \"But this is the template now. If you want fans to attend your game and you want to engage viewers, then you have to make the action an adjunct to the sideshow.\", \"Before long we'll have sideline rugby reporters popping up between the front rows to have a matey wee chat before a scrum engages. Coaches won't walk to the dressing room at halftime, but zoom their way there on a segway while stopping for selfies.\", \"Instead of being so desperately earnest, commentators will be louder and more colourful in the misguided belief that'll keep more of us away from the mute button.\", \"The Black Clash is the future. It is the template for how to stage and cover an event. It is organised fun that clearly appeals to an increasing number of Kiwis.\", \"Strap yourselves in sports fans, it could be a bumpy ride.\"]","href_hash":"b5aef99c7fa111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b5aef99c7fa111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
