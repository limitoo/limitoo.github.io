Vaccination rates for the youngest eligible Californians vary widely across the state \\u2014 and far more than they do for other age groups.\", \"In San Francisco, 37 percent of 5- to 11-year-olds have gotten at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, more than double the rate in Los Angeles County, according to state data.\", \"Even more extreme: In Marin County in the Bay Area, more than 58 percent of 5- to 11-year-olds are partially or fully vaccinated. In Kings County in the San Joaquin Valley, that figure is less than 5 percent.\", \"The numbers reflect an existing divide in Covid-19 vaccination rates and pandemic precautions across California, as well as parents\\u2019 heightened fears when it comes to vaccinating their youngest children.\", \"Still, Californians who have sought out vaccines for their 5- to 11-year-olds say they feel immense relief and an added layer of safety in the holiday season. Here are some stories you shared with me about your kids getting their shots:\", \"\\u201cMy 7-year-old, Paxton, recently completed his second Covid vaccination shot at a retail pharmacy in Napa. He was a little tentative about getting a shot. Upon sitting down, he asked the pharmacist, \\u2018Are you a professional?\\u2019 The kind man replied with seriousness, \\u2018Yes, I am. And here is my process. \\u2026\\u2019\", \"Of course, Paxton didn\\u2019t follow the pharmacist\\u2019s process and watched the needle go into his arm. He said it hurt but shed no tears.\\u201d \\u2014 Leslie Wong, Napa\", \"\\u201cMy 6-year-old, Jackson, has been asking us for nearly a year to get the vaccine! Though we live in sunny San Diego, Jackson loves to ski, and because he\\u2019s now vaccinated we can spend New Year\\u2019s skiing in Aspen with his grandparents.\\u201d \\u2014 Julia Pautz, San Diego\", \"\\u201cMy 11-year-old daughter was vaccinated at a county vaccination center in what used to be a Victoria Secret\\u2019s store. I\\u2019m still laughing. Life can be hilarious. Thank goodness for that.\\u201d \\u2014 Lisa Anderson Shaffer, Marin County\", \"\\u201cWith his parents and his grandmother having had a booster shot (plus his first vaccine shot done), my son was able to spend Thanksgiving with his grandmother and older, fully vaccinated cousins, even though none of the three households live in the same city.\\u201d \\u2014 Gabriela Hernandez-Lepe, Menlo Park\", \"\\u201cThe kids (and us too!) are excited to celebrate Christmas Eve as they have every year except last \\u2014 a giant family party at their grandparents\\u2019 house.\", \"Cousins are everywhere, Santa comes to visit, and there\\u2019s always too much food. Life moved on throughout the pandemic \\u2014 babies were born, tweens became teenagers, there were high school and college graduations, new relationships blossomed, and we also unfortunately lost loved ones along the way. But we haven\\u2019t been able to celebrate or grieve collectively as we would have two years ago, and being vaccinated means that we can have that again.\\u201d\\u2014 Stephanie Setzer, Windsor\", \"\\u201cMy 5-year-old son, Zander, was the first child in his kindergarten class to get vaccinated and he was overjoyed.\", \"Immediately after getting his shot, he told me that his top goals were to (1) see friends that he hasn\\u2019t seen since the beginning of the pandemic, and (2) visit New York so that he can meet the Ninja Turtles (in real life). I am guessing that one of those goals will be a bit easier to realize than the other.\", \"Because of the vaccine, Zander was able to spend Thanksgiving with his grandparents, aunt, uncles and cousins \\u2014 something he hasn\\u2019t done since the beginning of the Delta surge. I was hoping that this vaccine would allow us to have a birthday party for Zander in December and also continue to celebrate the winter holidays with extended family.\", \"I am hoping that Omicron doesn\\u2019t ruin the joy and freedom that Zander has so longed for and is on the cusp of being able to enjoy.\\u201d \\u2014 Jennifer Stark, Berkeley\", \"For more:\", \"Devin Nunes, a Republican representative, announced he would resign from Congress.\", \"For $1.5 million, homes in Sacramento, San Francisco and Altadena.\", \"Cauliflower recipes that aren\\u2019t cauliflower rice.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes from Jim Van Buskirk, a reader who lives in San Francisco:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.
