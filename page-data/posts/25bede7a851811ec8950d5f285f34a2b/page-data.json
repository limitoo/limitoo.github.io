It needed a good kickstart.\\\"\", \"However, with the first phase of the towers opening and council plans to bolster the revitalisation, the city was becoming something residents could be proud of, Tolley said.\", \"\\\"Centre cities used to be places people came to look at, and we want Tauranga to be like that too.\", \"\\\"That is the aim.
