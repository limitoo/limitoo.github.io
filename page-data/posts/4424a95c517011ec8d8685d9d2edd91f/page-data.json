Ms. Maxwell sexually exploited young girls by developing their trust, helped to normalize abusive sexual conduct and then \\u201cserved them up\\u201d to Mr. Epstein in a decade-long scheme, the prosecutor said.\", \"\\u201cThe defendant and Epstein made young girls believe that their dreams could come true,\\u201d Ms. Pomerantz said in Federal District Court. \\u201cThey made them feel special, but that was a cover.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBehind closed doors,\\u201d Ms. Pomerantz said, \\u201cthe defendant and Epstein were committing heinous crimes. They were sexually abusing teenage girls.\\u201d\", \"The trial of Ms. Maxwell, 59, the daughter of a British media mogul and a longtime fixture on the New York social scene, has been widely seen as the courtroom reckoning that Mr. Epstein avoided when he took his own life in prison a month after his arrest on sex-trafficking charges.\", \"The hotly anticipated trial will offer a new window into the exploits of one of the most notorious sex offenders in modern American history. Mr. Epstein\\u2019s crimes, his dealings with the criminal justice system and his death have been the subject of books, expos\\u00e9s, podcasts, conspiracy theories, lawsuits, investigations and documentaries. But they have never been aired in a criminal trial.\", \"Mr. Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on charges that he recruited dozens of girls to engage in sex acts with him at his estate in Palm Beach, Fla., and his mansion in Manhattan, paying them hundreds of dollars in cash after each encounter, a federal indictment said. He died the following month.\", \"Ms. Maxwell, who was arrested in July 2020, faces charges that include sex trafficking of a minor, enticing and transporting minors to engage in illegal sex acts and three conspiracy counts. She could face up to 70 years in prison if convicted of all counts.\", \"She has steadfastly maintained her innocence, and her lawyer, Bobbi C. Sternheim, told the jury that the evidence would not support the charges against her client.\", \"She described Ms. Maxwell as a \\u201cscapegoat\\u201d for Mr. Epstein\\u2019s actions, adding, \\u201cEver since Eve was accused of tempting Adam with the apple, women have been blamed for the bad behavior of men.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Sternheim sought repeatedly to separate her client from the disgraced financier, who even in death seemed to loom over the trial. His death had left \\u201ca gaping hole in the pursuit of justice\\u201d for many people, Ms. Sternheim told the jury. Ms. Maxwell is \\u201cfilling that hole,\\u201d she added. \\u201cFilling that empty chair.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Maxwell \\u2014 who has been detained in a Brooklyn jail since her arrest \\u2014 was escorted into the courtroom on Monday morning without handcuffs, wearing a cream-colored sweater and black pants. In the course of the day, about two dozen spectators \\u2014 including Damian Williams, the new U.S. attorney in Manhattan \\u2014 lined the benches of the courtroom, which was reconfigured during the pandemic to create more space for jurors and less room for spectators, who could watch the proceedings on closed-circuit video in other courtrooms.\", \"Outside the courthouse, a crowd of news cameras and onlookers formed early Monday morning, with hopes of being able to watch the first day of the trial. While the recent state trials of Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha, Wis., and of three men who were convicted in the murder of Ahmaud Arbery in Brunswick, Ga., were televised, there will be no video or recordings of Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s case: Cameras are largely barred from federal courtrooms.\", \"The trial could last up to six weeks, the parties have told the judge, Alison J. Nathan.\", \"The charges against Ms. Maxwell center on four accusers who say she groomed them to be abused by Mr. Epstein between 1994 and 2004, when they were underage. Those accusers, now adults, are expected to testify at trial, some under pseudonyms or with partial names, the government has said.\", \"Ms. Pomerantz opened her presentation to the jury with the story of one of those accusers, whom she identified only as \\u201cJane.\\u201d Ms. Pomerantz said Jane, then 14 years old, met Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell when the couple visited a summer camp for talented children.\", \"What Jane did not know then, Ms. Pomerantz said, was \\u201cthis man and woman were predators.\\u201d For Jane, she said, the meeting \\u201cwas the beginning of a nightmare that would last for years.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Sternheim, in her opening statement, described Mr. Epstein as a patron of the arts and \\u201csupporter of young talent\\u201d who backed girls like Jane in their endeavors \\u2014 in Jane\\u2019s case, providing a Manhattan apartment for her and her family.\", \"But Ms. Pomerantz described that financial support as a guise that allowed Mr. Epstein, accompanied by Ms. Maxwell, to lure vulnerable girls into his orbit for the ultimate purpose of abusing them.\", \"In later years, Ms. Pomerantz said, Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell abandoned the \\u201ccover of scholarships\\u201d and instead \\u201cdevised a pyramid scheme of abuse,\\u201d in which they encouraged girls to bring in other girls.\", \"Ms. Pomerantz said that when Ms. Maxwell sent a 14-year-old girl into a massage room with an adult man, she knew exactly what was going to happen.\", \"\\u201cCalling it a massage was a ruse,\\u201d Ms. Pomerantz said, \\u201ca ruse designed to get young girls to touch Epstein. An excuse for Epstein to touch the girls.\\u201d Ms. Pomerantz said the massages would escalate, and Mr. Epstein touched the girls, sometimes with a sex toy, and sometimes had sex with them.\", \"In addition to bringing girls in as masseuses for Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell was sometimes in the room while the abuse took place and sometimes touched the girls herself, Ms. Pomerantz said.\", \"The government also offered a pointed rationale for what it said was Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s participation in the scheme with Mr. Epstein: money.\", \"\\u201cWhile this horrific abuse was going on behind closed doors, the defendant was jet-setting in private planes and living a life of extraordinary luxury,\\u201d Ms. Pomerantz told the jury. \\u201cThese girls were just a means to support her lifestyle.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Pomerantz described how Ms. Maxwell had groomed girls for Mr. Epstein \\u2014 taking them on shopping trips and asking about their lives, their schools and their families. \\u201cShe won their trust,\\u201d Ms. Pomerantz said.\", \"\\u201cGrooming\\u201d describes a strategy predators use to try to break down a potential victim\\u2019s resistance to abusive conduct.\", \"She said Ms. Maxwell discussed sexual topics with the girls and helped normalize abusive sexual conduct.\", \"\\u201cShe put them at ease and made them feel safe,\\u201d Ms. Pomerantz said, \\u201call so that they could be molested by a middle-aged man.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Sternheim told the jury that much of what prosecutors referred to as \\u201cgrooming\\u201dwas \\u201clawful conduct.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe government wants you to put a sinister, subjective motive,\\u201d she said, \\u201cwhere the evidence will show none existed.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Sternheim also walked the jury through the four accusers who are expected to take the stand, saying their stories were \\u201cthin\\u201d and likening the prosecutors\\u2019 case as \\u201ctaking paper cutouts and putting them together.\\u201d\", \"She urged the jury to bear in mind three words: \\u201cMemory, manipulation and money.\\u201d The victims\\u2019 stories, she said, were years old and subject to contamination. They were manipulated, she said, by the coaching of lawyers seeking to capitalize on Mr. Epstein\\u2019s case. And they were motivated by money \\u2014 at least two of the accusers received payouts from a victims\\u2019 compensation fund drawn from Mr. Epstein\\u2019s estate.\", \"Late Monday afternoon, the government called its first witness: Larry Visoski, one of Mr. Epstein\\u2019s longtime pilots. Mr. Visoski testified that, over the course of nearly three decades, he regularly shuttled Mr. Epstein on one of the financier\\u2019s private jets between his residences in New York, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, New Mexico and Paris.\", \"\\u201cPretty much every four days we were on the road flying somewhere,\\u201d Mr. Visoski said.\", \"Mr. Visoski, who is expected to continue testifying Tuesday morning, described Mr. Epstein\\u2019s homes and the abundant support staff required to keep his household running. Ms. Maxwell, he said, played a vital role in managing those homes and in planning Mr. Epstein\\u2019s travel.\"]","href_hash":"4424a95c517011ec8d8685d9d2edd91f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4424a95c517011ec8d8685d9d2edd91f"}},
