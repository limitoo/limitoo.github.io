A quarter to over half of admissions are unvaccinated COVID patients, Dr. Jaewon Ryu, Geisinger's president and chief executive officer, said. Citing the increasing number of cases and percentage of positive tests, he expects the situation to worsen in the upcoming weeks.\", \"\\\"COVID continues to rage on,\\\" said Ryu, emphasizing the importance of vaccinations.\", \"Approximately 90 percent of COVID patients at Geisinger are unvaccinated while 8 percent received their doses over six months ago.\", \"Geisinger is also not the only health system experiencing the surge in the state.\", \"\\\"Hospitals statewide are strained and many are at or approaching capacity,\\\" with long ER wait times, Liam Migdail, spokesperson for the trade organization Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania, said.\", \"An average of 3,900 people each day have been admitted into hospitals with COVID all around the state in the past two weeks, the Pennsylvania Department of Health reported. The health department said that around 13 percent of the state's adult ICU beds and 10 percent of its medical-surgical beds are open.\", \"\\\"The current surge, largely driven by the unvaccinated population, is placing an enormous burden on our region's health care system,\\\" St. Luke's Vice President of medical and academic affairs Dr. Jeffrey Jahre said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948176/pennsylvania-covid-surge-extended-capacity.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Geisinger's president and CEO Dr. Jaewon Ryu expects the situation at Geisinger hospitals to worsen in the coming weeks, citing the increasing number of cases and percentage of positive tests.

In addition to the rising virus patient count, UPMC hospitals are seeing more patients who had put off care. Dr. John Goldman, a UPMC infectious diseases specialist, expects to see more influenza patients after there were almost no flu cases last year\", \"\\\"We're very full,\\\" he said.\", \"At Geisinger hospitals, the latest coronavirus surge means ambulances are backed up, ER doctors have resorted to making rounds in waiting rooms to diagnose patients with perforated bowels and other serious ailments, and COVID-19 patients are getting oxygen in crowded hallways, said Geisinger's Dr. Essie Reed.\", \"\\\"We're almost two years into this, and it still feels like every day is a crisis when we go to work,\\\" said Reed, an emergency physician at Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center in Wilkes-Barre and Geisinger's director of EMS. \\\"It's probably worse than it was last year.\\\"\", \"She said she recently took care of a young, unvaccinated married couple who both died of COVID-19 after refusing the \\\"proven therapies\\\" offered by Geisinger.\", \"\\\"We want to make these stories come to an end,\\\" said Reed, begging people to get their coronavirus shots \\\"so we're not taking our turns crying in the med closet over unnecessarily watching patients die.\\\"\", \"Ryu, the Geisinger CEO, displayed a line graph that showed the explosive trajectory of Geisinger's in-patient COVID-19 population.
