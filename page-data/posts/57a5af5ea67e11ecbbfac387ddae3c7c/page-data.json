Making sure we have a good start to the season, improving on things I didn't do so well last year, making those mistakes less this year is definitely a goal.\\\"\", \"Competing in just one championship this year may just help Lawson achieve that.\", \"As well as F2, he raced in the German Touring Car (DTM) series in 2021, only missing out on the title after being shunted off the track on the opening lap of the final race.\", \"\\\"It just makes it slightly easier adjusting to the car each weekend,\\\" Lawson said of his simplified 2022.\", \"\\\"There's also more racing [in F2] this year, so not big gaps like last year. Quite often I had three or four weekends, whether it be race weekends or testing in DTM, and then I'd go and drive a F2 car I hadn't driven for a month or two and have to adjust in a 45-minute practice.\", \"\\\"I learned a massive amount last year and have a huge amount more experience, so I'm really grateful to have done that (DTM), but now putting everything into F2 is definitely the right move.\\\"\", \"And given he was fresh off a long-awaited trip home to New Zealand, Lawson said he was more motivated than ever.\", \"\\\"Had I not gone back I would've mentally been in a different position now.\", \"\\\"It's always important to have those few weeks, because for 11 months you're only thinking of and working towards one thing.\", \"\\\"That downtime at home in New Zealand is so nice.
