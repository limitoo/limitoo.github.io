The only parts still missing from the Chinese version of the 1999 cult classic appear to be nude sex scenes.\", \"The changes, which drew international attention, were spotted in recent weeks by people watching the film on a streaming platform owned by Tencent, a giant Chinese entertainment company.\", \"Tencent has now restored 11 of the 12 minutes that were previously cut, The Hollywood Reporter said in an article this week. The New York Times confirmed that about one minute remains missing, mostly consisting of sex scenes involving the characters played by Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter. \", \"\\u201cFight Club\\u201d is not the first foreign movie in which the version made for the Chinese mainland audience differs from the original. The Chinese version of the 2018 Queen biopic \\u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\\u201d for example, cut references to the singer Freddie Mercury\\u2019s sexuality.\", \"Still, it\\u2019s unusual for foreign movies in China to include the pro-government written codas; those are typically reserved for Chinese-language films. It is also rare for people who censor movies for the Chinese market to undo their own handiwork.\", \"It was not immediately clear on Tuesday why, or precisely when, the original ending of \\u201cFight Club\\u201d was restored on Tencent \\u2014 nor why the ending had been altered in the first place.\", \"Kenny Ng, a film professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, said in an interview that he believed the changes to the ending last month were a result of self-censorship by Tencent. But he said it was also possible that the film\\u2019s Chinese distributor made the changes.\", \"Tencent declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the film\\u2019s Chinese distributor, Pacific Audio and Video, said that the company was not involved in editing the Tencent version of the film and had merely applied for clearance to have it released in China.\", \"New Regency, the Los Angeles-based company that produced \\u201cFight Club,\\u201d did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\", \"The rules governing what movies released in mainland China may or may not include have grown more stringent over the last few years.\", \"In the past, the rules were set by a division of China\\u2019s State Council, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television. But since 2017, censorship has been governed by a comparatively stricter rule, the Film Industry Promotion Law, which gives the authorities more latitude to define perceived offenses.\", \"The law says that films shown in China may not include anything that jeopardizes the country\\u2019s unity, sovereignty, public order or \\u201csocial ethics.\\u201d Also banned is anything that disrupts social stability, propagates superstition or defames cultural traditions.\", \"The original ending of David Fincher\\u2019s \\u201cFight Club\\u201d focuses on a successful plot to destroy a series of buildings. In the censored Tencent version that aired last month, that violence was cut. Instead, the movie ended just before the destruction with a note to viewers saying that the police \\u201crapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals, successfully preventing the bomb from exploding.\\u201d\", \"News that the film had been censored led to chatter on social media in China and elsewhere. One of the public figures who weighed in was Chuck Palahniuk, the writer whose 1996 novel inspired Mr. Fincher\\u2019s 1999 film.\", \"Mr. Palahniuk initially wrote sarcastically on Twitter that the censored ending was \\u201cSUPER wonderful!\\u201d But he later said in an interview with TMZ that it was closer to the ending of his book, in which the bomb malfunctions.\", \"This week, Mr. Palahniuk wrote on Twitter that China had \\u201cdone the right thing\\u201d by restoring the film\\u2019s original ending. His post included a drawing of a pink bar of soap, a reference to the movie\\u2019s most recognizable prop.\", \"Instead of \\u201cFight Club,\\u201d the lettering on the bar said \\u201cRight Club.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"82fb423288d211ecad4a011047af3d59"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"82fb423288d211ecad4a011047af3d59"}},
