arriving in New Zealand and Australia, chasing the biggest prize in the game.\", \"This FIFA Women's World Cup is touted to be the biggest and best ever.\", \"While members of the Football Ferns may be well known here, it's players from the power teams from North America and Europe that many of the fans are keen to see.\", \"Two time defending champions the USA have the best known players, but there will be plenty of admiration for the player who has been described as the best ever.\", \"The Brazilian striker Marta is a six-time World Player of the Year.\", \"This will be the 37-year-old's sixth and final World Cup.\", \"She's not the player she once was and before leaving Brazil coach Pia Sundhage conceded she may be used sparingly in this tournament.\", \"\\\"Just to be around her is contagious, she is generous and has a alot of energy.\", \"\\\"Will she be in starting lineup, I don't know...but the good part of that is she will play the role I will give her, I'm 100 percent about that.\\\"\", \"<img

their first World Cup after they dominated the European Championship.\", \"However, England have lost some key players to injury including Beth Mead, Leah Williamson and Fran Kirby.\", \"But captain Millie Bright says they still have the bulk of their Euro 2022 team to rely on.\", \"\\\"Everything stays the same the way we want to play.\", \"\\\"It's exciting to have new players in the squad and that's a part of football, we never want to see anyone out with injury, but it provides a great opportunity for someone to come in and showcase their skill and talent.\\\"\", \"Another team with an abundance of talent is Australia, with captain Sam Kerr helping keep Chelsea at the top of Super League in recent years.\", \"Much is expected of the Matildas after their 4th place finish at the Tokyo Olympics.\", \"Kerr, who is about to play her 4th World Cup, says it's important for them to stay in the moment.\", \"\\\"The biggest regret for me from the last few World Cups is getting caught up in things, football is such an up and down game that it's just staying in the moment.\", \"\\\"I think at the Olympics we really did that well and we just fell short so hopefully we can do a little bit better this time.\\\"\", \"<img

Eagles star doesn't feel she has the her side's fortunes resting on her shoulders.\", \"\\\"Just go out there and have fun and enjoy myself.\", \"\\\"I'm not under any pressure, the moment I'm not having fun then I have to leave it.\\\"\", \"But the USA are firm tournament favourites, with the squad full of stars, most notably forward Megan Rapinoe.\", \"She's excited for her fourth World Cup.\", \"\\\"It never gets old, there is always something incredibly special about be able to compete at the very highest level against the very highest level.\", \"\\\"I think this is going to be, just like every World Cup, the best World Cup.\", \"Throw in the likes of German midfielder Lena Oberdorf and Spanish midfield Alexia Putellas and football fans here are in for a treat.\"]","href_hash":"d881bd3c206e11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d881bd3c206e11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
