In high school English class, most of us were introduced to the concept of \\u201cuniversality,\\u201d which holds that the job of an author is to create characters with whom all readers, regardless of race and gender, can identify.\", \"As a woman, I am far more concerned about the treatment of women and minorities in decisions about which books should be published and reviewed than I am about their inclusion in books where they really don\\u2019t belong. I can\\u2019t count the novels written by men that I\\u2019ve read where I felt that had they been written by women, we wouldn\\u2019t even be hearing about them.\", \"It is depressing to realize that the creative process and literary criticism are now falling victim to political correctness.\", \"Lupi Robinson North Haven, Conn.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"John Plotz\\u2019s review of Fiona Sampson\\u2019s \\u201cTwo-Way Mirror\\u201d (Oct. 31) praises how the book, a biography of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, \\u201cpushes back against the neglect, bordering on amnesia, that has descended on a poet once widely celebrated.\\u201d\", \"On the contrary, a Barrett Browning revival has flourished in academia for several decades. In the 1990s, in the respected Dictionary of Literary Biography series, Beverly Taylor devoted almost 30 pages to her. In 1995, Angela Leighton and Margaret Reynolds published their anthology of \\u201cVictorian Women Poets,\\u201d whose 66 pages of Barrett Browning\\u2019s poetry pretty much demand a place in relevant course syllabuses. Also in the \\u201990s, publishers of the good old Norton anthologies put out a critical edition of her long but brilliant \\u201cAurora Leigh.\\u201d\", \"Plotz\\u2019s hope that \\u201cTwo-Way Mirror\\u201d will \\u201cinspire a new generation of readers\\u201d neglects the past 25 years, during which students of Victorian poetry would have needed an especially stubborn amnesia to avoid the possibility of finding inspiration in Barrett Browning\\u2019s poetry.\", \"Kathleen McCormackWayne, Pa.\", \"To the Editor:\", \" In his review of Evan Osnos\\u2019s \\u201cWildland\\u201d (Nov. 7), Angus Deaton describes Greenwich, Conn., and its \\u201ctransition from the Greenwich of Prescott and George H. W. Bush to one that largely favors Trump.\\u201d\", \"The data reflect no such transition, however. After supporting Republican presidential nominees in 11 of the 12 previous presidential elections, including Mitt Romney in 2012, Greenwich voters preferred the Democrats Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020 over Trump, each time by a decisive margin. Similarly, Greenwich\\u2019s Republican voters showed less enthusiasm for Trump than other Connecticut Republicans in 2016; while Trump won the statewide G.O.P. primary with over 58 percent of the vote, a majority of Greenwich Republicans cast ballots for other Republican presidential candidates.\", \"Brice H. PeyreNew York\", \"To the Editor:\", \" Each Sunday, the first section I reach for is the Book Review. And on most Sundays I squirm in frustration with more than half of the fiction reviews because they are littered with detailed plot descriptions. As this is a consistent practice, I must conclude that it is an editorial decision coupled with sheer laziness on the part of many reviewers.\", \"What happened to sticking with a book\\u2019s theme, style, context and quality (in the reviewer\\u2019s mind)?
