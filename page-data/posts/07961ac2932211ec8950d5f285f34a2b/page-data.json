The Islamic Center of San Antonio (ICSA) is asking anyone with information to call the city's police department.\", \"The child and her family fled Afghanistan in 2019 after \\\"threats that were posed,\\\" Lina's father, Riaz Sardar Khil,\\u00a0told CBS San Antonio affiliate KENS-TV.\", \"Lina was last seen in the playground of an apartment complex on December 20. Her mother walked away briefly, and returned to discover her child was missing. Lina was last seen wearing a red dress, black jacket and black shoes and had her brown hair in a ponytail, police said.\", \"Two weeks later, the FBI became involved in the case. The bureau's elite 12-member FBI Underwater Search and Evidence Response Team flew in from Washington, D.C. and was checking a lead, although there had been few, Police Chief William McManus said.\", \"\\\"I wish I could be more uplifting.

A lot of the debris gets washed down river. It accumulates. It is pretty dangerous down there.\\\"\", \"The San Antonio Police Department told CBS News there have been no updates to the case and it is still an active missing person investigation. \\\"The San Antonio Police Department, in partnership with our federal partners have worked tirelessly on finding Lina,\\\" the department's public information officer said.
