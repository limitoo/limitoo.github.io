Meta spokesperson Kevin McAllister said that the number was \\\"out of context\\\" and that the company does take down untrue messages about COVID-19, vaccines and voter fraud.\", \"But an internal Facebook memo from March said that the company's ability to identify misinformation and anti-vaccine messages not written in English was \\\"basically non-existent.\\\"\", \"For example, Instagram and Facebook, owned along with WhatsApp by parent company Meta, both banned the \\\"#plandemic\\\" tag last year on videos that contained virus conspiracy theories. But users on the platforms were still able to use the Spanish iteration \\\"#plandemia\\\" until last month, according to AP.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1941673/spanish-language-misinformation.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">While some social media companies have come under scrutiny for the proliferation of misinformation on their platforms, the spread of Spanish-language misinformation may be going even more unchecked.

And they say social media platforms that often host those mistruths aren't prepared.\", \"\\\"For a lot of people, there's a lot of concern that 2022 will be another big wave,\\\" said Guy Mentel, executive director of Global Americans, a think tank that provides analysis of key issues throughout the Americas.\", \"This month's elections may be a preview of what's to come.\", \"After Democratic incumbent Phil Murphy won New Jersey's close governor's race, Spanish-language videos falsely claimed the vote was rigged, despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud\\u2014a fact the Republican candidate acknowledged, calling the results \\\"legal and fair.\\\"\", \"In Virginia, where Republican Glenn Youngkin campaigned successfully on promises to defend \\\"parental rights\\\" in classrooms, false headlines around a controversial school board meeting emerged.\", \"\\\"Biden orden\\u00f3 arrestar a padre de una joven violada por un trans,\\\" read one of several misleading articles, translating to \\\"Biden ordered the arrest of a father whose daughter was raped by a trans.\\\"\", \"The mistruth was spun from an altercation during a chaotic school board meeting months earlier in Loudoun County that resulted in the arrest of a father whose daughter was sexually assaulted in a bathroom by another student. The father claimed the suspect was \\\"gender fluid,\\\" which sparked outcry over the school's policy allowing transgender students to use bathrooms matching their gender identity.\", \"In reality, the White House wasn't involved with the meeting. The man was arrested by the local sheriff's department. It's also unclear how the suspect identifies.\", \"Loudoun County was already the epicenter of a heated political debate over how the history of racism is taught in schools\\u2014another issue that became fodder for misinformation and political attacks on Spanish-language websites this summer, said Maria Teresa Kumar, president and CEO of Voto Latino, a nonprofit that mobilizes Hispanics to become politically engaged.\", \"\\\"It has everything to do with trust in institutions. Trust in government,\\\" said Kumar, whose group works to combat the misinformation. \\\"Eroding that trust will transfer not just to voting in the midterms, but just overall disengagement from your government.\\\"\", \"Stretched truths accusing some Democrats of being socialists or communists could also dominate the online narrative, said Diego Groisman, a research analyst at New York University's Cybersecurity for Democracy project.\", \"During the 2020 election, Groisman flagged Facebook ads targeting Latino voters in Texas and Florida that described Biden as a \\\"communist.\\\" The ads in Florida\\u2014where a majority of the country's Venezuelan population is concentrated\\u2014compared Biden to that country's socialist president, Nicol\\u00e1s Maduro.\", \"\\\"There were clearly specific Spanish-speaking communities that were being targeted,\\\" said Laura Edelson, the lead researcher for NYU's program.\", \"Evelyn P\\u00e9rez-Verd\\u00eda, a Florida Democratic strategist who watches Spanish misinformation patterns, says many online narratives intentionally stoke \\\"fear in the Spanish-speaking communities.\\\"\", \"One conspiracy theory mentioned on talk radio grew out of Lady Gaga's golden bird brooch at Biden's inauguration. Some spreading the claim noted a similar brooch once worn by Claudia L\\u00f3pez Hernandez, the first openly gay mayor of Bogota, Colombia, signaled the new president was working with foreign leftists.\", \"\\\"They're not going to stop. They're going to double down on it,\\\" P\\u00e9rez-Verd\\u00eda said of the misinformation.\", \"Meanwhile, researchers at the nonpartisan Global Disinformation Index estimated that Google will make $12 million this year off ads on websites that peddled COVID-19 disinformation in Spanish.

The inaccuracies are shared back through YouTube videos or messaging apps with Spanish speakers in expatriate communities like those in Miami and Houston.\", \"Those falsehoods are more likely to reach U.S. Latinos because they tend to spend more time on sites such as YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram, according to an October Nielsen report.\", \"\\\"We see YouTube accounts or radio stations churning out mis- or disinformation regarding a whole range of things that they pick up from fringe U.S. outlets,\\\" Mentel said.\", \"Some are working to fill the void of reliable information in those communities.\", \"The Oakland, California, news service El Timpano delivers a text message of local news in Spanish to roughly 2,000 subscribers every week.
