So the ability to move avocados and make them available to those people that want to buy them and use them has been severely restricted.\", \"\\\"The industry is not looking for any support from the government ... we accept that there is volatility in our industry. What would help us, is it would be easy to access our export markets.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"fd45de7041f711ec9ed6000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fd45de7041f711ec9ed6000017025a03"}},
