A sample of the substance was tested by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) and found to contain diethylene glycol,\\\" High Alert says.\", \"The chemical is found in a wide range of industrial products and can be toxic in very low doses, the service says, including in the production of antifreeze, brake fluids, wallpaper strippers, and as a plasticiser.\", \"High Alert is strongly urging Kiwis not to consume the substance, particularly as the summer festival circuit approaches.\", \"\\\"It's possible it will continue to be sold in the community,\\\" it says. \\\"High Alert strongly urges people not to take this substance at all.\\\"\", \"Early symptoms of diethylene glycol consumption can include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, as well as inebriation, the service says. Other symptoms can be delayed more than 48 hours after consumption, including abnormal urination, abdominal/lower back pain, weakness and shortness of breath.\", \"It's currently unclear how widely diethylene glycol is being circulated, but ingestion can cause severe kidney and neurologic injuries.\", \"\\\"[Diethylene glycol] is indistinguishable from 1,4-BD, GHB and GBL by eye, so testing is recommended to help minimise the risk. Drug checking services will likely be able to test for diethylene glycol,\\\" High Alert says.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"KnowYourStuffNZ is running regular drug checking clinics over the summer. Information on upcoming clinics can be found on their website and Facebook.\\\"\", \"The drug is described as a clear and colourless viscous liquid, which is practically odourless and has a sweetish taste.\", \"If someone is unconscious, extremely agitated for longer than 15 minutes, has chest pain or breathing difficulties for longer than five minutes, stops breathing, or has a seizure, call 111 immediately and request an ambulance, High Alert says. Always tell emergency responders what someone has taken.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"You won't get in trouble, and it could save a life,\\\" High Alert says.\", \"The National Poisons Centre is available 24/7 to help with advice for exposures to this, or any other substance, on 0800 764 766 (0800 POISON).\", \"Earlier this month, police warned partygoers about a new drug, synthetic cathinone dimethylpentylone, which is new to New Zealand's market and is reportedly being sold as MDMA.\", \"Very little is known about the drug and police are strongly urging people not to take the substance.\", \"The drug is a pink pill with a Playboy logo and is approximately 1cm long, High Alert says. It can also resemble a white crystal.\", \"Dimethylpentylone was recently detected in two samples tested by KnowYourStuffNZ in Dunedin. The individual who brought in one of the samples said they had consumed the substance and found the experience \\\"very unenjoyable\\\".\", \"In October, the Government announced that drug checking services - clinics that conduct scientific tests on substances in order to indicate their composition - would receive an $800,000 funding boost ahead of the summer festival season.\\u00a0\", \"Health Minister Andrew Little said the Government supports drug testing services and their work to help keep young people safe this summer.\", \"\\\"This is not about condoning drug use, but about keeping people safe,\\\" Little said. \\\"There is clear evidence that having drug checking services at festivals changes behaviour and reduces harm.\\\"\", \"Last summer marked the first time that drug checking services were made legal in New Zealand - however, only people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will be able to attend events and festivals this season.\"]","href_hash":"4e0bacb4651f11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4e0bacb4651f11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
