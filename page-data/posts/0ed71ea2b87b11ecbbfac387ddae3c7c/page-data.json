She will cooperate with authorities.\", \"On February 7, 2022, with attorney Toby Shook by her side, Jennifer appeared in a Dallas courtroom and pleaded guilty to one count of use of interstate commerce in the commission of murder-for-hire. In exchange\\u00a0 for the guilty plea, prosecutors agreed to take the death penalty off the table and recommend a life sentence. Jim Holland says even the guilty plea was vintage Jennifer.\", \"Jim Holland: She can't allow herself to face the death penalty, because she's incapable of killing herself \\u2026 Because at the end of the day, that's the only person she really loves.\", \"There was one important detail that authorities insisted be part of that plea. \", \"Jim Holland: She has to admit to the fact that her husband never abused her \\u2026 physically or sexually.\", \"And as for those photos she'd sent showing injuries... \", \"Steve Pickett: She sent images that we know are \\u2026 stock images, fake images. They're not real. \", \"Jennifer also came clean about how she'd spent the GoFundMe money. Her supporters were devastated. \", \"Jenna Wilson: It's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking.\", \"Peter Van Sant: Do you feel that you were taken advantage of?\", \"Jenna Wilson: It's hard not to feel that way.\", \"Peter Van Sant: Do you feel betrayed?\", \"Jenna Wilson: It's hard not to feel that way.\", \"Peter Van Sant: What kind of person would do that?\", \"Melissa Gonzales: A monster?\", \"Shamona Jackson: Yeah, a monster.\", \"She may have used the GoFundMe account to pay Darrin Lopez, but court records show that Jennifer did not pay for Jamie's funeral expenses and to this day, owes $6,500. What's more, court records also show Jennifer has asked that $200,000 from Jamie's estate be put into her prison commissary account.\\u00a0 \", \"Christy Jack: It's a case of greed \\u2026 manipulation. It's a tragedy all the way around \\u2026 She robbed the community of someone that they respected. She robbed her daughter of a father. It was a very selfish act on so many levels.\", \"Jamie's parents and sister did not attend the hearing. The family home was sold, and Amber moved out of Texas with their dog, Maggie. She still speaks to her mother twice a week.\", \"Christy Jack: I mean, in the end Jennifer Faith is the only mother she'll ever know.\", \"After Jennifer signed her plea deal, Lopez also agreed to answer questions and admitted killing Jamie. He told investigators he reconnected with Jennifer because he \\\"was in a very dark place\\\" and initially never intended to reunite romantically or break up her family.\", \"Christy Jack: It's difficult to say which came first, whether it was the chicken or the egg \\u2026 whether their romance was rekindled at the same time as her realization that he's the perfect pawn. \", \"Peter Van Sant: Now, when you say \\\"romance,\\\" this is a very unusual romance, one in which, apparently, they physically were never together.\", \"Christy Jack: They were never physically together at that time \\u2026But memories are powerful.\", \"Lopez, who hasn't changed his not guilty plea, also told authorities the murder was Jennifer's idea. His attorney has said publicly that Jennifer took advantage of Lopez, who suffered that traumatic brain injury in the Army.\", \"Theresa\\u00a0Jensen: I almost feel that Jennifer is more responsible for Jamie's death than Darrin. Because Darrin was, in my opinion \\u2026 was just preyed upon by her. And she manipulated him to do what she wanted done.\", \"Those who knew and loved Jamie, like former neighbor Melisa Gonzales, are still coping with his death.\", \"Melisa Gonzales: He cared about people. \\u2026 it didn't matter what your race, religion. He didn't care about any of that. He was just an easygoing guy. \\u2026 He was the guy for our kids. \\u2026 That meant a lot. \\u2026 The kinda guy that he was, you can't just get that anywhere.\", \"Friends Theresa and Ross Jensen are grieving too.\", \"Theresa Jensen: He was \\u2026 just all-around wonderful guy. \\u2026 I was blessed to know him.\", \"Ross Jensen: I hope that Amber carries some of Jamie forward \\u2026 I hope she really does something unique and special with his memory.\", \"Jennifer Faith is scheduled to be sentenced on May 26.\", \"Darrin Lopez's trial date has not been set. \", \"GoFundMe offered full refunds to anyone who donated to the Faiths' account.\", \"Produced by Paul La Rosa, Dena Goldstein and Josh Yager.
