It's a saliva rapid antigen test that links up to an app for a result. While approved by Germany's tough medical regulator, it's not approved here.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"This Government has not allowed the private sector to solve problems and the private sector can solve them quicker,\\\" he told Newshub.\\u00a0\", \"The problem is the application process - a maze of extra tough hoops to jump through - before the Director-General gets the final say. Some have had applications in for months, to no avail.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We should all have access.

There are some real lemons out there.
