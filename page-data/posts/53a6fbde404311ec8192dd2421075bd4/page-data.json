But as often happens in this series, this week\\u2019s episode pulls back a bit, bringing some much-needed comic relief alongside the ongoing melodrama. In \\u201cLion in the Meadow,\\u201d the Roys take a break from scorching the Earth and get back to more subtle power plays, using schoolyard insults and small gestures of disrespect to needle each other. It\\u2019s all so oddly delightful.\", \"The pettiness comes early and often. When Kendall has to join a Waystar conference call to strategize about the upcoming shareholders\\u2019 meeting, he uses an unprintable variation on \\u201cLittle Lord Fauntleroy\\u201d as his sign-on (which is then repeated, hilariously, when he abruptly hangs up). Later, when he\\u2019s asked to talk with Logan briefly on a private airstrip tarmac, before they both meet up with a nervous Waystar investor, Kendall zooms off to get to the meeting first, leaving the message, \\u201cTell Dad, \\u2018Meep-meep\\u2019 \\u2026 It\\u2019s from \\u2018Road Runner.\\u2019\\u201d For the most part, that\\u2019s the level of the attacks and counterattacks this week.\", \"The investor in question is Josh Aaronson (Adrien Brody), who owns about 4 percent of Waystar \\u2014 a holding which, he complains, has lost 10 percent of its value since Kendall started giving news conferences. If Josh is going to back the Roys over Sandy and Stewy at the shareholders\\u2019 meeting, he needs to know how far this family feud will go. Does Kendall really want his father in jail? Does Logan really think his son is a mentally ill drug addict? How does this all end? Can the Roys maybe \\u201cclose up the outrage shop\\u201d?\", \"There\\u2019s another reason Josh invites Logan and Kendall to join him at his sprawling estate. He needs to know if they think of him as a smart guy who knows what to do with his money \\u2014 and is thus owed some respect \\u2014 or as some speculator who got lucky, and who only has value because of what he can buy. Is he really an important part of their business? Is he a part of this Waystar family?\", \"The biggest chunk of this episode features these three guys putting on a show for each other. Josh tries to tease a little honesty out of the Roys, while Logan and Kendall pretend they\\u2019re still a loving family running a viable business, and wielding acumen no outsider can match. What makes these scenes so absorbing is that it\\u2019s not too hard to imagine Kendall, and maybe even Logan, wanting to believe the fantasy they\\u2019re selling. As they sit side by side in their matching black baseball caps \\u2014 with Logan saying he can still see his son in charge of Waystar someday, and Kendall lovingly calling his old man \\u201cgeezer\\u201d \\u2014 they almost seem to be playing roles they wish were real.\", \"It doesn\\u2019t last. The first few times Josh steps away, the Roys maintain stony silence. Later, as they walk back to the main house through some exhaustingly bumpy hills, Josh leaves the two behind and they start making threats, each insisting the other is playing with a weak hand.\", \"Then Logan gets physically ill and the game is up. Josh makes it clear he can only back the Roys if Logan is running things, and seeing the patriarch stumble spooks him \\u2014 as does Kendall\\u2019s attempt to keep talking business while his father is sick. The first cue that these three weren\\u2019t on the same page came earlier in the day, when Kendall called the Beatles a \\u201cgreat band\\u201d and Josh and Logan both said they\\u2019re just a \\u201cgood band.\\u201d The lines were drawn then. Kendall never could convince Josh to cross them.\", \"Beyond the vigorous one-upmanship on the beach, what makes this episode so lively is that much of it is spent with the two most reliably comic \\u201cSuccession\\u201d characters: Greg and Tom.\", \"Greg is persuaded to meet with Logan, who offers him a drink and then exasperatedly calls in his assistant to sweeten the nervous, indecisive kid\\u2019s cocktail with Coca-Cola. (The sound of the soda can opening is like a tiny rebuke to Greg\\u2019s manly ambitions.) Logan lets his great-nephew know that he has a little leverage over Waystar right now, and that he needs to use it wisely. Greg, though, is too shaky to assert himself. He keeps getting distracted by his beverage, calling it \\u201cstrong for a man\\u201d and reflecting on the hard-drinking olden days, saying, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how you did it back in the \\u201960s. Different times indeed. Better times? Not for all.\\u201d\", \"As for Tom, he\\u2019s been spending his time lately trying to pick out a good prison for himself and indulging in gallows humor, laughing that his co-workers are calling him \\u201cTerminal Tom.\\u201d Finally he breaks down in front of Shiv, dropping his fake-courage and musing anxiously about his future life behind bars.\", \"\\u201cWhat if I forget to burp the toilet wine?\\u201d he frets. \\u201cHow late can I read? When is lights-out?\\u201d\", \"There\\u2019s a good contrast between the Logan/Kendall/Josh scenes \\u2014 featuring three guys comfortable with flexing \\u2014 and the much sillier confrontation in this episode between Tom and Greg. When Tom tries to get his former lackey to make a clear decision on what he wants, Greg finally admits that he\\u2019d like to be moved into a leadership position in Waystar\\u2019s theme parks division. Tom then moans again about jail before trying to wrestle with Greg, snarling, \\u201cLet\\u2019s fight like chickens!\\u201d\", \"Greg refuses, shouting, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to do it,\\u201d prompting Tom to reply, \\u201cNeither do I, Greg!\\u201d He tries to turn this into avuncular advice saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re so hard to riff with. That is a big career obstacle.\\u201d\", \"But that \\u201cneither do I\\u201d may be the most honest moment Tom has had in this show. Guys like Logan genuinely enjoy a bloody fray. Guys like Tom only like it when they\\u2019re winning.\"]","href_hash":"53a6fbde404311ec8192dd2421075bd4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"53a6fbde404311ec8192dd2421075bd4"}},
