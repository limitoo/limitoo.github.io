The way we went about it in this game, we did that.\", \"\\\"We know there's a long way to go. It would be nice to front up again next week and go one better.\\\"\", \"Opener Zak Crawley led off the rearguard with an assured 77 and Ben Stokes, who famously steered England to a dramatic victory at Headingley in the last Ashes series, chipped in with 60 runs, despite being clearly hampered by a side injury.\", \"Although not reaching the heights he can as a batsman, Root played his part with 24 runs in a fourth-wicket partnership of 60 with Stokes, after rain stopped play for an hour after lunch.\", \"Playing with a thumb injury, first-innings centurion Jonny Bairstow contributed 41, before becoming Scott Boland's 14th victim in the paceman's second test.\", \"Also nursing a finger injury that will rule him out of the fifth test, Jos Buttler scored 11 runs from 38 balls, before becoming one of two batsmen to depart in three deliveries from Cummins with the new ball.\", \"\\\"There was clearly a bit of pain relief required,\\\" Root adds.\\u00a0\\\"It's not just physical element, but the psychology of knowing that you're going into a pressure situation not 100%, to then be able to perform at the level some of the guys did was phenomenal really.\\\"\", \"For the second year in a row, Australia failed to dismiss their opponents on the final day of the SCG test to secure victory, after India batted out a draw last year.\", \"\\\"It was a great game of test cricket,\\\" says Cummins. \\\"We came close.\", \"\\\"We'd have loved to go 4-0, but it was a good match.\", \"\\\"When you are that far ahead in a game, of course you want to win it.
