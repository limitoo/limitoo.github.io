Before the deal was announced, its shares had slumped more than 37 percent since reaching a record high last year, hit by allegations of sexual harassment of employees and misconduct by several top managers.\", \"The company is still addressing those allegations and said on Monday it had fired or pushed out more than three dozen employees and disciplined another 40 since July.\", \"Chief executive Bobby Kotick, who said Microsoft approached him about a possible buyout, would continue as chief executive of Activision following the deal, although he is expected to leave after it closes, a source familiar with the plans said.\", \"In a conference call with analysts, Microsoft boss Nadella did not directly refer to the scandal but talked about the importance of culture in the company.\", \"\\\"It's critical for Activision Blizzard to drive forward on its renewed cultural commitments,\\\" he said, adding \\\"the success of this acquisition will depend on it.\\\"\", \"Data analytics firm Newzoo estimates the global gaming market generated $US180.3b of revenues in 2021, and expects that to grow to $US218.8b by 2024.\", \"Microsoft already has a significant beachhead in the sector as one of the big three console makers. It has been making investments including buying \\\"Minecraft\\\" maker Mojang Studios and Zenimax in multibillion-dollar deals in recent years.\", \"It has also launched a popular cloud gaming service, which has more than 25 million subscribers.\", \"According to Newzoo, Microsoft's gaming market share was 6.5 percent in 2020 and adding Activision would have taken it to 10.7 percent.\", \"Executives talked up Activision's 400 million monthly active users as one major attraction to the deal and how vital these communities could play in Microsoft's various metaverse plays.\", \"Activision's library of games could give Microsoft's Xbox gaming platform an edge over Sony's Playstation, which has for years enjoyed a more steady stream of exclusive games.\", \"\\\"The likes of Netflix have already said they'd like to foray into gaming themselves, but Microsoft has come out swinging with today's rather generous offer,\\\" said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\", \"Microsoft's offer equates to 18 times Activision's 2021 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).
