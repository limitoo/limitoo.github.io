She also wished them \\\"the very best\\\" moving forward. Ingersoll had been a customer of Stutzman's for almost a decade before she refused to make floral arrangements for his and Freed's wedding.\", \"The agreement was reached between the Alliance Defending Freedom and the American Civil Liberties Union, representing the parties in this case. It will allow Stutzman to \\\"preserve her conscience,\\\" as she will not have to act against her Southern Baptist religious beliefs. According to the Alliance Defending Freedom release, she will also avoid paying \\\"potentially ruinous attorneys' fees,\\\" according to the Alliance Defending Freedom release.\", \"The ACLU brought the lawsuit against Stutzman in 2013, citing that her refusal to take the job was discriminatory. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson also filed a separate lawsuit claiming that she violated the state's Consumer Protection Act. The case went through multiple reviews through the Superior Court, the state Supreme Court, and finally, the U.S. Supreme Court. All courts sided in favor of Ingersoll and Freed.\", \"The couple plan to donate the settlement to a local PFLAG chapter. Meanwhile, Stutzman is looking to retire.\", \"\\\"I am willing to turn the legal struggle for freedom over to others,\\\" she said in her letter announcing the settlement. \\\"At age 77, it's time to retire and give my business to someone else.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936659/barronelle-stutzman.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Floral artist Barronelle Stutzman said she had paid $5,000 to Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed.

That judgment still stands.\", \"\\\"We are pleased to hear that Arlene's Flowers and Barronelle Stutzman have reached a settlement agreement with the couple they refused to serve,\\\" Ferguson said in an email to the Tri-City Herald.\", \"The country's highest court vacated Washington state's previous ruling and sent it back to the lower court in 2018 for another review.
