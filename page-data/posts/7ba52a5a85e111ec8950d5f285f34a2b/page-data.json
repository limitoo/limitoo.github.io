They would choose other destinations instead, Tasker said.\", \"\\\"If you're sitting at your headquarters of your airline in North America and Asia and you're looking at New Zealand versus another destination that is open and welcoming travellers, you're going to be pretty hesitant to deploy your aircraft to our country and to put your seats on sale, because you don't know that you're going to have the certainty of having any passengers on board that flight.\\\"\", \"They needed to know within the next month to six weeks when self-isolation requirements would end, he said.\", \"\\\"And if they do not see confirmation of that they will not deploy their aircraft to New Zealand at the end of the year, and then the consequence of that is we won't be seeing the international visitors that we need to rebuild our international tourism industry, but also international aircraft bring 80 percent of our cargo capacity, so that will impact our high value exporters but also the import of essential goods.\\\"\", \"Tasker also told Checkpoint the international flight movements at Auckland in 2021 were about the same as what they were 35 years ago.\", \"\\\"From an Auckland Airport perspective, 12 airlines flying to 22 international destinations. If we compare that to pre-Covid, we had 29 international airlines flying to 43 destinations.\", \"\\\"And if we look in the South Island it's even worse, there's currently one international airline flying to one destination.\", \"\\\"So we've got a long way to rebuild. And we're literally competing with other airports and countries for that international airline capacity. And at the moment, we don't look like a very attractive place for an airline to invest the resources.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"7ba52a5a85e111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7ba52a5a85e111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
