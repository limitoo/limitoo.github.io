I am a strict constructionist when it comes to the role of turkey at the Thanksgiving table, but I understand that mine is not a universal view. There are those, for instance, who prefer a multitude of side dishes to the merits of a beautifully burnished bird. And for them \\u2014 perhaps for you \\u2014 we\\u2019ve put together a wonderful collection of vegetarian Sidesgiving recipes to improve this year\\u2019s feast. (Look for it in the print edition of our Sunday newspaper this weekend!)\", \"The time to explore those recipes is now. It\\u2019s a good weekend to decide which ones you want to make and then to rehearse them in your kitchen so that you don\\u2019t wake up on Thanksgiving morning with a pit in your stomach because you\\u2019ve never made pan-griddled sweet potatoes with miso-ginger sauce before. Practice is still the best way to get to Carnegie Hall.\", \"And so, check out this French onion stuffing (above), these hashed brussels sprouts with lemon, this cheesy Hasselback potato gratin, this creamed greens potpie. Try your hand at green bean and corn almondine, no-knead dinner rolls, these caramelized plantains with beans, scallions and lemon. Five-spice roasted carrots with toasted almonds might be good, especially this weekend alongside a chicken roasted like this Cantonese-style turkey. You\\u2019ll find your own way.\", \"Other things to cook this weekend that have nothing whatsoever to do with the coming holiday, that promise joy but aren\\u2019t homework: a spinach and feta borek; some lemony chicken soup with fennel and dill; cast-iron sourdough pancakes.\", \"Me, I\\u2019m going to attempt to recreate an epic breakfast I had a few days ago at the Star Diner in Norwalk, Ohio (long story), with eggs over easy next to hash browns, a small chicken-fried steak and sausage gravy. Wake up early on Sunday to do that, serve the meal around 10, and you\\u2019ll be good on the couch until dinner time.\", \"Thousands and thousands more recipes to make this weekend and for Thanksgiving are waiting on New York Times Cooking. (Yes, you need a subscription to access them. Subscriptions are what allow us to continue to do this work that we love. Will you please, if you haven\\u2019t already, subscribe today? Thanks.) You can find inspiration, as well, on our Instagram page and YouTube channel, where Melissa Clark just showed us how to make her best pecan pie.\", \"And should you run into trouble along the way, either in your kitchen or on our site and apps, just reach out for help: cookingcare@nytimes.com. Operators are standing by.\", \"Now, it\\u2019s nothing to do with gizzards or celery tops, but I still think you ought to read Amanda Fortini on the enduring appeal of Laura Ashley, in T Magazine.\", \"And while you\\u2019re at it with the reading, here\\u2019s Ian Parker in The New Yorker with a good one, \\u201cThe Great Organic-Food Fraud.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s probably not for everyone, but you might enjoy this playlist the Getty Museum in Los Angeles put together, exploring the sounds of Fluxus: vintage and reinterpreted songs.\", \"Finally, here\\u2019s a poem from Diane di Prima, \\u201cCity Lights 1961,\\u201d to transport you to a particular California at a particular time, and now. Enjoy all that, cook well and I will, as ever, see you on Sunday.\"]","href_hash":"bbe1d62e43d611ecb938b37873fd234c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bbe1d62e43d611ecb938b37873fd234c"}},
