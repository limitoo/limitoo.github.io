entry error\\\" was\\u00a0behind a mistake on its website that wrongly indicated a six-year-old girl had experienced \\\"heavy menstrual bleeding\\\" and other illnesses after receiving the Pfizer vaccine.\\u00a0\", \"While the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has corrected the typo, it has acknowledged there have been separate cases in Australia where children have been given a COVID-19 vaccine \\\"in error\\\" despite no jab approved for use in children under 12 years of age domestically.\\u00a0\", \"But it said there had been no serious adverse events in any of those\\u00a0children who had received a vaccine mistakenly.\", \"The TGA regularly publishes reports of adverse events it has received from consumers, industry and health professionals relating to medicines used in Australia, including vaccines, on a publicly accessible online database.\\u00a0\", \"A report from late October listed a six-year-old female as having experienced a long list of worrying health problems, including back and chest pain, headaches, heavy menstrual bleeding, and insomnia after getting the Comirnaty (Pfizer) vaccine.\\u00a0\", \"The ABC was made aware of the report after a screenshot of the database was circulated online amongst parents who are hesitant to give a COVID-19 vaccine to their children and fear it will\\u00a0be mandated broadly.\\u00a0\", \"After being contacted by the ABC, the TGA said the age of the patient had been incorrectly entered into the database.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The report relating to a child of six\\u00a0contains a data entry error that has now been corrected,\\\" the TGA said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The report relates to an adverse event in an adult.\\\"\", \"The TGA's Database of Adverse Event Notifications has been edited, now showing the age of the patient as 41 years.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">No adverse effects in under 12s</div>\", \"Other entries in the database show there have instances where children under 12 have received a COVID-19 vaccine, which have not yet been given the tick of approval by the TGA for use in that age cohort in Australia.\", \"Following inquiries by the ABC, the TGA said it has received a \\\"small number\\\" of reports where a child under 12 had been given the vaccine.\", \"\\\"None of the reports of administration of a COVID-19 vaccine to a child under 12 has included any serious adverse events.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Adverse events where reported included expected side effects such as headache, muscle pain and pain at the injection site.\\\"\", \"The TGA said it has investigated the incidents and will not be taking further action.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Review of these cases has not identified any systematic causes for these errors requiring action from the TGA,\\\" it said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The TGA shares reports of vaccination with state and territory health departments who monitor local vaccine administration, and analyses reports to detect signals for administration issues and where relevant improve information to vaccination providers to help prevent future errors.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/4d2d9965be0ce474595da6ab692f0f9a\\\"

Group.\", \"She said while the TGA was very committed to high quality data, errors can be caused by\\u00a0something as simple as a misplaced keystroke.\\u00a0\", \"Such errors, she said, may be seized upon by \\\"vaccination activists with nefarious intentions\\\" and other individuals who have genuine questions about COVID-19 vaccines. \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The vaccination issue is such a highly charged topic right now because people's whole lives are being affected because they are not vaccinating, and they are also trying to defend their positions amongst their peers and with people on social media.\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's expected they will grab whatever they can to support their cause and their position even if it's clear that it's something that's an error.\\\"\", \"Professor Leask also warned that children should not be administered Covid-19 vaccine's until they were granted approval for local use.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Incorrect administration of a vaccine is a vaccine safety issue that needs careful attention and needs to be addressed, that's different to a data entry error,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"[Pfizer is]\\u00a0unlikely to harm the child based on what we know from the trials, but the fact is that these vaccines are not yet licensed for children in Australia and until they are they should not be given to
