Flexibility, though, may yield savings.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-18T10:17:35.000Z","content":"[\"In addition to bargains on toys, clothing and electronics, Black Friday traditionally delivers deals on hotel rooms, tours and cruises, too.\", \"But as with so much else, the pandemic and the post-vaccine recovery have changed travel\\u2019s relationship to the traditional sales season that kicks off around Thanksgiving. After previewing hundreds of sales encompassing Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Travel Tuesday and beyond, I can safely say this year: Don\\u2019t expect much.\", \"Hotels, in particular, are back in the driver\\u2019s seat, often recording prepandemic-level bookings driven by leisure travel and the return of international visitors. In San Jose del Cabo, Mexico, Acre resort is officially post-recovery; 2021 bookings there have doubled 2019 figures. In addition, labor shortages have helped prop up room rates by preventing some hotels from operating at capacity. New York City is still short thousands of hotel rooms that haven\\u2019t reopened, causing rates to swell.\", \"\\u201cExcept for very specific markets and regions like the Caribbean offering discounts for sales in the low season, I don\\u2019t see any reason hotels would rely on sales and discounts,\\u201d said Nicolas Graf, the associate dean of the New York University School of Professional Studies in the Jonathan M. Tisch Center of Hospitality.\", \"The pandemic also forged shorter booking windows, throwing traditional revenue management systems out the window and making it \\u201chard to decide on a sales strategy ahead of time,\\u201d Mr. Graf added. \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to see very short-term, last-minute deals, but I don\\u2019t see them in the long term.\\u201d\", \"Indeed, my survey turned up many immediate deals in December for the first quarter of 2022. There are also longer minimum stays in many places, matching the trend toward lengthier visits and requiring fewer deep cleanings between guests.\", \"Permanent sale sites have also somewhat eroded Black Friday\\u2019s power. Redweek, for example, offers time shares averaging 30 to 50 percent off weeklong stays year-round in resort destinations like Aruba and Hawaii.\", \"If hotels are the remainder rack with few choice offerings, other travel companies that are slower to recover \\u2014 namely cruises and group tours \\u2014 are often putting whole stores on sale. And the entire industry is springboarding off supply-chain frustration, encouraging travelers to \\u201cbuy experiences\\u201d that don\\u2019t rely on shipping backlogs, such as virtual seminars or in-person tours with Context Travel, priced 15 percent off Nov. 26 to 29.\", \"The following are guidelines on what to expect of \\u2014 and how to exploit \\u2014 tepid Black Friday travel savings. Be aware that deals change frequently and may sell out before you get there.\", \"With travel resuming and occupancy rising, shoppers can expect to see bargains on less-desirable midweek nights, off-peak seasons and longer stays.\", \"As Sanovnik Destang, the executive director of Bay Gardens Resorts on St. Lucia, which is offering 40 percent off some nights compared with half off last year during its seasonal sale, put it, \\u201cWe wanted to make sure we\\u2019re not giving away the shop.\\u201d\", \"For example, there\\u2019s a four-night minimum at the new all-inclusive O2 Beach Club & Spa on Barbados to get 50 percent off when booking Nov. 23 to 30 for travel through Dec. 20, 2022. Normal rates start at $608 a night.\", \"It will be the off-season in Bermuda when the Grotto Bay Beach Resort offers half-off rates, December through March, starting at roughly $140 after the discount on bookings made Nov. 26 to 30.\", \"Remember, sales stated as \\u201cup to X percent\\u201d means the steepest discounts are usually at slow periods. The Hotel Effie on Florida\\u2019s panhandle has rates up to 40 percent off during its seasonal sale for travel Dec. 1 through year-end 2022, but it reserves the lowest discounts for quieter times in January, February, November and December (rooms start at $229 before the sale).\", \"As always, beware risky terms. In Sonoma, Calif., MacArthur Place Hotel & Spa is offering 50 percent off rooms booked Nov. 25 to 29 for travel Nov. 28 to April 28, but the deal requires prepayment and is not refundable or changeable.\", \"Because many deals cover just the first quarter of 2022, I recommend travelers consider where they want to go \\u2014 to see a sister in Denver, take your student on a college tour or do business in Silicon Valley \\u2014 and shop with that list.\", \"In Northern California, for example, the new Ameswell Hotel in Mountain View will offer 25 percent off rates booked between Nov. 25 and 29 for travel Jan. 1 to April 30 (use the code BLACKFRIDAY). For Denver, check the Rally Hotel sale, Nov. 26 to Nov. 29, for 52.80 percent off rooms (a play on the city\\u2019s 5,280-foot elevation). At Graduate Hotels, college towns across the country, rates normally start from about $160 to $500, but from Nov. 29 to Dec. 3, they will be discounted up to 50 percent for travel through March 31.\", \"If you can\\u2019t find a sale in a target city, try one of the larger hotel chains. Accor, for example, plans to offer 30 percent off rooms booked Nov. 22 to 29 in properties across North and Central America for stays Nov. 22 to March 31.\", \"Expect plenty of blackout dates and penalties. Kimpton\\u2019s brand-wide sale, Nov. 23 to Dec. 6, offers up to 20 percent off (up to 25 percent if you join the free loyalty program) but the bookings are only fully cancelable seven days in advance.\", \"As you might expect, Black Friday rewards the most flexible travelers.\", \"Some of the best deals are for travel in the next few weeks, which effectively dilutes their value. The high-end Uniworld Boutique River Cruises is offering guests who have a cruise booked now through Dec. 31 the opportunity to book a future cruise \\u2014 also departing in 2021 \\u2014 for 50 percent off.\", \"The new Alaia Belize Autograph Collection on Ambergris Caye in Belize is offering 20 percent off rooms booked Nov. 22 to 30 for travel Dec. 1 to 22 and Jan. 3 to 31, 2022. Nightly rates before the discount start at $399.\", \"Near Scottsdale, Ariz., Hermosa Inn will offer 15 percent off rooms, plus two welcome cocktails, for stays Nov. 19 to Jan. 9. December rates start at $509 before the discount.\", \"The Archer Hotel group, which has seven locations, including New York City where rates normally start at $168, is offering 20 percent off bookings made Nov. 24 through 28 for stays Nov. 27 to Jan. 2.\", \"During the pandemic, with international travel stifled and travelers seeking to avoid strangers, group tours suffered. It\\u2019s no surprise their substantial incentives are seasonal bait.\", \"\\u201cIf you don\\u2019t come to the plate with a good offer, you will potentially lose some customers,\\u201d said Christian Wolters, the chief marketing officer at TourRadar, a small group tour operator that will offer discounts up to 70 percent off, compared to 60 percent last year.\", \"G Adventures will put more trips on sale \\u2014 515 compared with 450 last year \\u2014 and more of them will be steeply discounted, including nearly 100 trips at 30 percent off. After the discount, and excluding airfare, a nine-day trip in Colombia comes in at $1,434 and eight days in Morocco at $679.\", \"\\u201cThere has been so much positive news in the world of travel over the past few weeks as more countries open up, and the sale provides that extra incentive for people who have been waiting to book,\\u201d said Bruce Poon Tip, the founder of G Adventures.\", \"Abercrombie & Kent is putting many of its private journeys that depart in the first half of 2022 on sale, most at 40 to 50 percent off, Nov. 29 to Dec. 3, including an eight-day trip to Botswana that normally starts around $6,000 priced near $3,000.\", \"Adventure travel itineraries include $500 savings on most 2022 cobranded trips costing $3,500 or more from Austin Adventures and Active Adventures, Nov. 26 to 29. Sea Kayak Adventures will offer 15 percent off paddling trips in Baja, Mexico, through April 2022 with deposits made by Dec. 6. Normal trips run three to 10 days and start from $890 to $2,600.\", \"As tour sales indicate, depressed demand for international trips means you may find sales there.\", \"For example, while you won\\u2019t find a huge deal at The Broadmoor\\u2019s Cloud Camp wilderness property near Colorado Springs \\u2014 which, on the heels of a very busy year, is offering a Cyber Monday sale of 10 percent off select 2022 stays that normally start at $1,055 \\u2014 you will find deals in Chile. There, Tierra Hotels, which operates remote lodges in Patagonia, Chiloe and the Atacama Desert, is offering its first-ever seasonal sale at 40 percent off stays booked Nov. 29 for travel through April 30, 2022 and 30 percent off stays beyond that, through April 2023 (two nights minimum). Rates, which include meals and guided excursions, normally start at $800 a person a day.\", \"Sales on big-ticket, far-flung places include a few small ships in the Gal\\u00e1pagos. Metropolitan Touring will add a two-night stay at Quito\\u2019s boutique Casa Gangotena, valued at $1,120, on Black Friday for most 2022 Gal\\u00e1pagos bookings, which start at $4,052 for five days on a 40-guest yacht.\", \"Ecoventura will offer 15 percent off its 20-person-yacht Gal\\u00e1pagos cruises, which start at $8,950 a person before the discount on select 2022 departures January to March booked Nov. 25 through 30 (email info@galapagosnetwork.com to book).\", \"The year-old H\\u00f4tel Barri\\u00e8re Le Carl Gustaf on St. Bart in the Caribbean will hold its first Black Friday sale from Nov. 26 to 29, with 15 percent off suites, which normally start at $990, plus daily breakfast, a yoga or Pilates class, two massages, airport transfers and a $50 food-and-beverage credit. Blackout dates include the first week of January and March 16 to 20.\", \"While you will see Black Friday cruise deals from lines like Royal Caribbean and Holland America, you may also see them during \\u201cwave season,\\u201d a sales period that runs roughly from mid-January to March when the majority of bookings take place, encouraged by incentives.\", \"\\u201cWave season is kind of considered our Black Friday, but prepandemic, wave season started earlier and earlier,\\u201d sometimes in November, said Michelle Fee, the chief executive and founder of Cruise Planners, a travel agency.\", \"Still, she recommends booking early as a risk-free way to get what you want \\u2014 such as the exact dates, ships and cabins \\u2014 since most cruise lines will re-price your deal should the fares drop before your final payment is due.\", \"Some deals to come include 20 percent off and a $1,000 shipboard credit on select sailings Nov. 21 through May 5, 2023, with the boutique cruise line Azamara during its sale Nov. 19 to Dec. 3. A seven-night cruise for two in Greece in June starts around $5,100 before the sale.\", \"From Nov. 22 to 30, the expedition line Hurtigruten will have deals up to half off specific sailings, including a nine-day trip to Iceland (normally around $5,700).\", \"The deals may not last. Assuming the return to cruising continues on an even keel, Ms. Fee foresees itineraries in places like Alaska and the Mediterranean, where people largely haven\\u2019t been able to cruise for two summers, selling out. The agency\\u2019s overall sales are 24 percent ahead of where bookings were in 2019 for the coming year.\", \"Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.
