He was 68.\", \"Steven Marshall, South Australia\\u2019s top official, announced his death on Monday, though he did not say when or where he died. In 2017 Mr. Gulpilil learned that he had terminal lung cancer, something he addressed in a documentary released this year called \\u201cMy Name Is Gulpilil.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Marshall, in a statement, called Mr. Gulpilil \\u201can iconic, once-in-a-generation artist who shaped the history of Australian film and Aboriginal representation onscreen.\\u201d Others had heaped similar praise on Mr. Gulpilil over the years. In 2019, presenting him with a lifetime achievement award, the National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee, which celebrates Indigenous Australian communities, said he \\u201crevolutionized the way the world saw Aboriginal people.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gulpilil often played characters who explore or are affected by the intersection of Indigenous and modern cultures in Australia, something he knew from personal experience and did not always handle well. In between his acting roles, he had trouble with alcohol and spent time in prison, including for domestic abuse. Though Mr. Gulpilil sometimes seemed to mix easily in the broader world, Rolf de Heer, the director with whom he worked most often, said demons found him there.\", \"\\u201cDavid can\\u2019t handle alcohol,\\u201d Mr. de Heer said in his director\\u2019s notes for \\u201cCharlie\\u2019s Country.\\u201d \\u201cHe can\\u2019t handle cigarettes, or sugary drinks, or almost anything addictive. All of these substances, foreign to his culture, both soothe him and enrage him.\\u201d\", \"One part of the moviemaking world that Mr. Gulpilil didn\\u2019t have trouble with, however, was the camera \\u2014 he always seemed to be a natural, especially when, as was often the case, the setting of the film was the Australian wilds. As he put it in an autobiographical one-man stage show he performed in 2004, \\u201cI know how to walk across the land in front of a camera, because I belong there.\\u201d\", \"David Gulpilil Ridjimiraril Dalaithngu is believed to have been born in 1953 in Arnhem Land, in Australia\\u2019s Northern Territory. Missionaries are said to have assigned him a birth date of July 1.\", \"He was also assigned the name David at a government-run English school that he attended for a time.\", \"\\u201cThey asked me what was my name,\\u201d he said in a 1978 audio interview posted by the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, \\u201cand I said, \\u2018My name is Gulpilil,\\u2019 and suddenly they said, \\u2018Ah, yeah, we\\u2019ll give you David.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"He didn\\u2019t care for the school and its paternalism \\u2014 \\u201cYou got your culture, I got my culture,\\u201d he said \\u2014 and instead cultivated a reputation as an excellent ceremonial dancer. His fluidity and love of performing caught the attention of the British director Nicolas Roeg when Mr. Roeg came to Australia looking for an Aboriginal youth for \\u201cWalkabout,\\u201d a story about two white children lost in the wilderness who are befriended by an Indigenous teenager. (Few Aboriginal actors had appeared in feature films at the time, though documentarians had visited Indigenous communities.)\", \"The film led to international travel. Mr. Gulpilil, who was also a musician, used to tell the story of having his room at Cannes invaded by firefighters, who couldn\\u2019t place the sounds he was making on his didgeridoo \\u2014 a traditional wooden instrument \\u2014 and thought they might be the rumblings of a fire.\", \"Several television roles followed \\u201cWalkabout,\\u201d and then in 1976 Mr. Gulpilil was back on the big screen in \\u201cMad Dog Morgan,\\u201d a drama about an Irish outlaw (played by Dennis Hopper) who is a wanted man in Australia. Soon after came \\u201cStorm Boy,\\u201d in which he played an Aboriginal man who befriends a lonely boy and joins with him in raising some pelicans.\", \"Mr. Gulpilil reached a much wider audience when he appeared in \\u201cCrocodile Dundee.\\u201d As a friend of Paul Hogan\\u2019s swashbuckling title character, he delivers one particularly good joke after his character meets a New York journalist played by Linda Kozlowski. She immediately tries to take his picture.\", \"\\u201cYou can\\u2019t take my photograph,\\u201d he says.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d she answers. \\u201cYou believe it\\u2019ll take your spirit away.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cNo,\\u201d he says. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got the lens cap on.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gulpilil was especially proud of his work in \\u201cThe Tracker\\u201d (2002), one of several films he made with Mr. de Heer. He played the title character, who leads several white men on a brutal journey in search of a fugitive.\", \"\\u201cAs he has in other Australian films, including \\u2018Walkabout,\\u2019 \\u2018The Last Wave\\u2019 and \\u2018Rabbit-Proof Fence,\\u2019 Mr. Gulpilil has the mystical aura of a man so profoundly in touch with the earth that he is omniscient and safe from harm,\\u201d Stephen Holden wrote in his review in The New York Times.\", \"His most acclaimed role came in \\u201cCharlie\\u2019s Country,\\u201d another project directed by Mr. de Heer; the two men share the screenwriting credit. The movie is about an Aboriginal man struggling to maintain traditional ways. Parts of it were drawn from Mr. Gulpilil\\u2019s own life. He and Mr. de Heer began developing the story while Mr. Gulpilil, struggling with alcohol at the time, was in jail for breaking his wife\\u2019s arm.\", \"His performance won the best-actor award in the Un Certain Regard section of the Cannes festival.\", \"Mr. Gulpilil was married several times. Australian newspapers said his survivors include seven children.\", \"Mr. de Heer, in an interview with The Herald Sun of Australia shortly after Mr. Gulpilil won the acting award at Cannes, talked about the pressures his friend felt living in the traditional Indigenous world and in the world that included places like Cannes.\", \"\\u201cHe struggles in both,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHe\\u2019ll say he can live in both cultures, but I don\\u2019t think he does well in either.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ca8d69e2516c11eca6f197babd29927a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ca8d69e2516c11eca6f197babd29927a"}},
