Tesla shares slumped about 5% in premarket trading on Monday.\", \"Musk said he would abide by the results of the poll, which ended with 58% of more than 3.5 million votes calling for him to sell the stock. Musk owns about 17% of the 1 billion outstanding Tesla shares. If he sold 10% of his holdings at their current price of around $1,170 per share, it would net him around $20 billion.\", \"Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock.\", \"Do you support this?\", \"But Musk's motivation for selling the stake could be deeper than a push from a Twitter poll, according to the New York Times' DealBook. Musk holds about 23 million stock options, awarded in 2012, that will expire in August. But the grant \\u2014 valued at about $30 billion \\u2014 is structured in such a way that he would likely have to pay income taxes when he exercises the options, the report noted. The tax bill could exceed $10 billion.\", \"Musk's poll received pushback from at least one Democratic lawmaker who has been advocating for a billionaires tax on the likes of the Tesla CEO, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos and others.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Whether or not the world's wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn't depend on the results of a Twitter poll,\\\" Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, wrote in response to Musk's tweet. \\\"It's time for the Billionaires Income Tax.\\\"\", \"Whether or not the world\\u2019s wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn\\u2019t depend on the results of a Twitter poll.
