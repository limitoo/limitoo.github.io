Employment in New York City\\u2019s arts, entertainment and recreation sector plummeted by 66 percent from December 2019 to December 2020, according to a state report.\", \"Tourists from outside the U.S. comprise about 15 percent of Broadway\\u2019s audience during a traditional season, said Charlotte St. Martin, the president of the Broadway League. Across the last five seasons at the Metropolitan Opera, international ticket sales have averaged about 20 percent of the total box office.\", \"And more than half of New York\\u2019s international visitors visit an art gallery or museum during their trip, according to data from NYC & Company, the city\\u2019s tourism marketing organization. One in four people go to some kind of live performance when they are in the city \\u2014 be it a concert, play, musical, dance performance or opera. And when they do so now, they will need to comply with the same vaccination rules that New Yorkers must follow in order to attend live events and enter museums.\", \"Ken Weine, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said that before the pandemic, international travelers accounted for about a third of the museum\\u2019s visitors; without them, the museum has hit something of a \\u201cceiling\\u201d on attendance, he said.\", \"Currently, the number of people who visit the Met daily is about half of what it was before the pandemic. And from a revenue perspective, welcoming back international visitors helps the bottom line: Mr. Weine noted that although New Yorkers may pay what they wish when they visit the Met, other visitors, including foreign tourists, must pay $25.\", \"\\u201cThe Met is an encyclopedic museum that collects art from 5,000 years of human creativity. Core to the Met mission is presenting this art to New Yorkers and to people around the world,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve really missed that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"860961ca40c511ec86a5336d99224f30"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"860961ca40c511ec86a5336d99224f30"}},
