Let\\u2019s talk about leftovers. It\\u2019s the day after Thanksgiving, and while I have been looking forward to spending the day with people I haven\\u2019t seen for two years, I was perhaps equally anticipating Leftovers Friday, which is the first day, really, of Leftovers Weekend. I hope you\\u2019ve availed yourself of a sandwich with all the fixings by the time you read this.\", \"If Thanksgiving fare isn\\u2019t your thing, or you\\u2019ve had your fill of it, I hope you\\u2019re digging into something else. Joan Nathan\\u2019s matzo ball chicken stew, perhaps? Stouffer\\u2019s-inspired mac and cheese?\", \"A holiday weekend is the perfect time to catch up on reading, and you\\u2019ll have no problem finding something to suit you from our Books desk\\u2019s annual compilation of 100 Notable Books. (I\\u2019ve got Jo Ann Beard\\u2019s \\u201cFestival Days\\u201d on deck.)\", \"Paul Thomas Anderson\\u2019s 1970s-set \\u201cLicorice Pizza\\u201d is in theaters in New York and Los Angeles, and you can catch the animated film \\u201cEncanto\\u201d around the country. For those who prefer the comfort of the couch, Jeremy Renner stars in the new Marvel series, \\u201cHawkeye,\\u201d on Disney+. If you\\u2019ve got a bunch of people with disparate tastes looking for something to watch together, that might be the thing.\", \"I hope you have at least one chance this weekend to thoroughly catch up with someone, to hear about what they\\u2019ve been doing and how they\\u2019ve been dealing. Get other people\\u2019s stories. Tell them yours. Holidays are milestones, times for taking stock, when we measure our lives by what\\u2019s happened since this moment on the calendar last year. Or, perhaps, this moment two years ago.\", \"Thanks to all who have sent in their catharsis songs, the songs that have been offering them release from big emotions lately. Send yours to athome@nytimes.com and we\\u2019ll put them all together in one long exhalation of a playlist. (Check out our previous playlists here and here.) Or just write to us about whatever\\u2019s on your mind. We\\u2019re At Home and Away. We\\u2019ll read every letter sent. As always, you\\u2019ll find more ideas for leading a full and cultured life, at home and elsewhere, below. I\\u2019ll see you next week.\", \"Times subscribers can sign up here to receive this newsletter twice a week. There\\u2019s more to read, do and watch in our archive.
