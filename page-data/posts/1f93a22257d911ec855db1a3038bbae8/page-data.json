He also ruled that the alleged plan by Weinstein's lawyers to manipulate McGowan into giving someone working for them a pre-release copy of her book, which included the accusation against Weinstein, did not amount to racketeering.\", \"The judge allowed her to amend and refile the two remaining fraud charges because McGowan said the actions alleged in the charges had a severely negative impact on her career and reputation.
