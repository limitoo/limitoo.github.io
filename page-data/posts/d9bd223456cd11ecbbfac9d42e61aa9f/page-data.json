He was 77.\", \"The cause was a cardiac episode, his daughter Claudia Humphrey Henry said.\", \"A fearsome pass-rusher at 6 feet 4 inches and 250 pounds, Humphrey was inducted into the Hall, in Canton, Ohio, in the senior category in 2014 after narrowly missing out three times in the regular voting.\", \"Sacks did not become an official N.F.L. statistic until 1982, the year after Humphrey\\u2019s last season. A study of game films by researchers going back to 1960 credited him with 130 unofficial sacks.\", \"Humphrey played in six Pro Bowl games and was twice named a first-team All-Pro. He was a key figure in the Falcons\\u2019 1977 defensive alignment known as the Grits Blitz, which yielded only 129 points, an N.F.L. record low for a 14-game season. But Atlanta struggled on offense and finished at 7-7, just missing the playoffs.\", \"The Falcons had only two winning teams between 1968, when Humphrey joined them, and 1977, his last full season with the team. (He missed the 1975 season with a knee injury.)\", \"When the Falcons fell to 1-3 at the outset of the 1978 season, Humphrey had his fill of defeat.\", \"\\u201cOne day I was sitting in the locker room and said, you know, this thing isn\\u2019t getting any better,\\u201d he told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2014. \\u201cI put my stuff in the locker and left, it was just that simple. I wasn\\u2019t mad at anybody, because there was nothing I could do as a player but do what I did. They said they weren\\u2019t going to trade me. That was obvious.\\u201d\", \"After sitting out the remainder of the season, Humphrey was traded to the Eagles for two draft picks. At age 36 he had a team-leading 15\\u00bd regular-season sacks for the 1980 Eagles team that lost to the Oakland Raiders, 27-10, in the Super Bowl. He retired after the 1981 regular season in Philadelphia.\", \"Apart from his sacks, Humphrey ran a fumble back 24 yards for the only touchdown in the Falcons\\u2019 10-7 victory over the Vikings in December 1969, which snapped Minnesota\\u2019s 12-game winning streak.\", \"He twice recovered fumbles for safeties and had a pair of interceptions.\", \"\\u201cIn Atlanta, I never got used to losing,\\u201d Humphrey told The Associated Press in 2014. \\u201cIt made me play harder. I used to say to myself: \\u2018Well, if we lose the game, the guy who lined up in front of me won\\u2019t have anything to be excited about. When he looks at the film, he\\u2019s not going to like what he sees of himself. I\\u2019m going to go out there and try to wear him down.\\u2019 That was the only thing that kept me motivated.\\u201d\", \"Claude Humphrey was born on June 29, 1944, in Memphis, a son of Dosie Humphrey, a school maintenance engineer, and Millie Hayes Humphrey, who worked as a domestic. He played football, basketball, ran the low hurdles and excelled in the shot put in high school.\", \"He was an HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) All-American linemanwhile playing for outstanding Tennessee State University teams and was voted to the Black College Football Hall of Fame in 2012.\", \"Humphrey was selected by the Falcons as the third overall choice in the 1968 pro football draft. He was named the N.F.L.\\u2019s defensive rookie of the year, recording 11\\u00bd sacks.\", \"After his playing career, Humphrey owned a livestock ranch in Oakland, Tenn., and was a defensive line coach with the Falcons.\", \"In addition to his daughter Claudia, he is survived by his daughters Chandra Cheyenne Humphrey-Robinson and Candice Cherokee Humphrey and a grandson. His wife, Sandra Harrell Humphrey, died in 2013.\", \"\\u201cI was aggressive, very aggressive,\\u201d the Hall of Fame quoted Humphrey as once saying. \\u201cI tried to play the game to the point where when I walked off the field, there was nothing that I didn\\u2019t cover. I tried to play all out. I didn\\u2019t take any prisoners.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"d9bd223456cd11ecbbfac9d42e61aa9f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d9bd223456cd11ecbbfac9d42e61aa9f"}},
