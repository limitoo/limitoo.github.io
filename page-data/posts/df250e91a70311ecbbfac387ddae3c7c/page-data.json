So, it makes this very difficult to actually predict.\\u201d\", \"Taylor said it was also troubling that the tests were being conducted outside of a laboratory-controlled environment and was not going to be run by registered medical laboratory scientists.\", \"\\u201cWe, in a diagnostic laboratory, have to work in accredited facilities with registered medical practitioners. Now obviously this instrument is just going to be put in a pharmacy, that's not a controlled environment, they\\u2019re not an accredited laboratory so that becomes a real issue.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cWe don't know how good the test is to be honest.\", \"\\u201cI mean, we would be happy to work with these people and assist them in actually working it all up.\", \"\\u201cYou've got to look at the background here - what sort of work was actually done on this testing regime? And what do the results compare to? In our laboratories, we obviously work towards WHO standards for Covid antibody testing, I mean none of that's been coming out of the information that's coming from this company.\\u201d\", \"The other worries were that people would act in ways that could be detrimental once they found out their antibody levels, he said.\", \"\\u201cThe other problem that we're going to see as well is that if their levels are low, does that mean they're going to turn up at the vaccination centre demanding vaccination? I mean, that's where the correlation has not been shown to be useful.\", \"\\u201cEffectively to me, this looks like a way of making money.\\u201d\", \"On another matter, Taylor said there were also concerns being raised over unvalidated methodologies of using Rapid Antigen Tests.\", \"\\u201cWe're seeing some people saying that you can get away with swabbing your throat, and your mouth and all sorts of other places.\", \"\\u201cUnfortunately, these rapid antigen tests have not actually been validated or verified for this, so then it becomes a problem.\", \"\\u201cWe don't in a laboratory, for example, look for a positive, we don't go \\u2018Oh my God, that should be positive, let's make it positive\\u2019 - that almost appears to be what's happening here.\\u201d\", \"He said there was \\u201can opportunity coming up\\u201d to clear up these \\u201ccontraindications\\u201d.\"]","href_hash":"df250e91a70311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"df250e91a70311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
