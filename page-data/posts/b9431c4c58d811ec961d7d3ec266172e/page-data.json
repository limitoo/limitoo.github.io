Mr. Norwood waited more than six agonizing months before he received his device.\", \"\\u201cIt felt like forever,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI haven\\u2019t been working. I haven\\u2019t been doing much of anything.\\u201d\", \"Around the world, many of the largest industries are jockeying to secure scarce stocks of computer chips. Automakers have slashed production for a lack of chips, threatening jobs from Japan to Germany to the United States. Apple has cut back on making iPads. Retailers have prepared for a holiday shopping season pockmarked by shortages of must-have electronics.\", \"The companies that make computer chips \\u2014 most of them clustered in Asia \\u2014 have ramped up production while scrambling to fill orders from their largest customers. That has made purchasing chips exceedingly difficult for smaller companies. One of those niche buyers of chips is ResMed, the San Diego-based company that makes the CPAP that Mr. Norwood finally received last month.\", \"\\u201cMedical devices are getting starved here,\\u201d the company\\u2019s chief executive, Michael Farrell, said in an interview. \\u201cDo we need one more cellphone? One more electric car? One more cloud-connected refrigerator? Or do we need one more ventilator that gives the gift of breath to somebody?\\u201d\", \"ResMed has struggled to buy enough chips, Mr. Farrell said, constraining its ability to make a range of vital equipment \\u2014 from ventilators used by Covid patients to breathing devices that sustain premature infants.\", \"The company is \\u201cproducing less than 75 percent of what our customers need,\\u201d Mr. Farrell said.\", \"Mr. Farrell has found himself in an uncustomary role: beseeching his suppliers to allocate more of their goods to him so that his company can work through a growing backlog of orders.\", \"This campaign has yet to yield more chips, though it has provided poignant lessons about the priorities at work as the global economy strains to return to normal nearly two years into the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m fighting against very big-name automotive companies and cellular communications companies and others who also want more supply,\\u201d Mr. Farrell said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re such a small percentage of the total semiconductor chip output that we don\\u2019t often get the attention.\\u201d\", \"Medical device manufacturers have this year spent an estimated $6.4 billion on computer chips, according to Gartner, a research firm.\", \"The automotive industry has spent $49 billion. Makers of wireless communications gadgets like cellphones and tablets have purchased nearly $170 billion worth of chips \\u2014 more than 26 times as much as medical device manufacturers, according to Gartner.\", \"The shortages are assailing every industry. But much as airlines prioritize their most frequent fliers in the face of a flight-canceling blizzard, chip makers are in many cases favoring their largest customers, expert say.\", \"\\u201cEveryone else is faced with the same struggle,\\u201d said Willy C. Shih, an international trade expert at Harvard Business School. \\u201cBut it is true that if you are Apple or someone who buys a lot, you probably get more attention.\\u201d\", \"The shortages are in large part the result of botched efforts to anticipate the economic impact of the pandemic.\", \"As Covid-19 emerged from China in early 2020, it sowed fears of a global recession that would destroy demand for a vast range of products. That prompted major buyers of chips \\u2014 especially automakers \\u2014 to slash their orders. In response, semiconductor plants reduced their production.\", \"That proved a colossal mistake. The pandemic shut down restaurants, movie theaters and hotels, while slashing demand for cars. But lockdowns imposed to choke off the virus increased demand for an array of products that use chips, like desktop monitors and printers for newly outfitted home offices.\", \"By the time global industry figured out that demand for chips was surging, it was too late. Adding chip-making capacity requires as much as two years of lead time and billions of dollars.\", \"In North America, Europe and elsewhere, medical device manufacturers are governed by strict product safety standards that limit their flexibility in adapting to trouble. Once a company like ResMed gains regulatory clearance to use a supplier, it cannot simply seek out a new one that might have a ready stock of chips without first going through a time-consuming approval process.\", \"That meant that ResMed had to figure out how to squeeze more chips out of its existing supply chain.\", \"Far from simple components, computer chips come in enormous varieties, each made with multiple parts that are typically made in multiple countries.\", \"Faced with the prospect of getting shut out, Mr. Farrell rooted through his supply chain, identifying the suppliers of his suppliers, in the hopes of persuading them to prioritize ResMed\\u2019s factories.\", \"Mr. Farrell soon realized that a primary reason that his chip supplier could not meet his demand was that \\u2014 five levels up the chain \\u2014 a Taiwanese manufacturer of silicon wafers had exhausted its inventory.\", \"Because that plant could not deliver extra products, the next link in the chain \\u2014 a company that combines wafers and circuitry \\u2014 could not produce more of its components. That meant that another company that buys those components and packages them into clusters was unable to make more of them.\", \"And that meant that ResMed\\u2019s supplier of circuit boards could not buy enough of those clusters, leaving ResMed\\u2019s factories in Singapore, Sydney and Atlanta short of circuit boards.\", \"Mr. Farrell took it on himself to try to unstick his supply chain. Drawing on government contacts in Australia, where he was born and raised, he set up a conversation with a board member of the wafer company.\", \"In October, during a getaway with his wife in British Columbia to celebrate their anniversary, Mr. Farrell took time out for a Zoom call. The board member introduced Mr. Farrell to another board member in London, who then reached the company\\u2019s head of sales in San Francisco. Mr. Farrell connected the sales chief of the wafer company with ResMed\\u2019s president of operations in Singapore.\", \"ResMed\\u2019s orders amounted to barely 1 percent of the wafer company\\u2019s output. A mere fraction of 1 percent in additional wafers was enough to satisfy ResMed\\u2019s needs.\", \"The wafer manufacturer initially agreed to the increase, but then reversed that decision.\", \"\\u201cIn fact, they reduced our allocation,\\u201d Mr. Farrell said.\", \"All of this explained why Mr. Norwood was stuck waiting for his CPAP.\", \"Born in Minnesota, Mr. Norwood, 44, has spent his adult life seeking refuge from the bite of winter. He lived in Maui for seven years, and then moved to San Diego in the fall of 2019, working as a waiter at a waterfront hotel restaurant.\", \"Early last year, he was watching a movie with a housemate when he suddenly passed out.\", \"\\u201cIt was pretty scary,\\u201d Mr. Norwood recalled. \\u201cI woke up and my housemate is tapping me on the shoulder. I was disoriented.\\u201d\", \"A week later, he blacked out again. His concentration was weakening throughout the day. Short walks winded him.\", \"He stopped working, applying for disability payments.\", \"Early this year, he spent a night in a sleep laboratory at the University of California, San Diego. Doctors observed that his breathing stopped 62 times per hour, while his blood-oxygen level decreased to alarming levels.\", \"When the doctors administered a CPAP, Mr. Norwood\\u2019s breathing returned to normal. They arranged for him to receive one at home. He looked forward to resuming a normal life.\", \"Yet weeks later, the device had yet to arrive. When Mr. Norwood called his insurance company to inquire, it told him that he was on a waiting list, with no clarity on how long he should expect to wait.\", \"\\u201cThey said: \\u2018We have no idea. No one is telling us anything,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Norwood recalled.\", \"On the web, he learned about the shortage of computer chips. He read a story about an airline pilot who had sleep apnea and was not flying because he had yet to receive his own CPAP.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m just a waiter trying to bring people food and drinks, and I can\\u2019t get a CPAP,\\u201d Mr. Norwood said. \\u201cIf the airplane pilot isn\\u2019t getting his, it might be a while before I get mine.\\u201d\", \"When he finally received the device in November, it changed his outlook.\", \"\\u201cLast night was the best sleep I have had in years,\\u201d he said the day after picking it up, adding that he was hoping to return to work.\", \"But the experience had left Mr. Norwood shaken about the realities of who gets what in a time of bewildering shortages.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s so unfortunate how money controls everything,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOur priorities are really skewed.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b9431c4c58d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b9431c4c58d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}},
