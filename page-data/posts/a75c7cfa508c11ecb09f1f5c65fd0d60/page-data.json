Kathy Hochul of New York declared a state of emergency partly in response to the emerging Omicron variant of the coronavirus. Most governors did not comment publicly on the threat over the weekend, but some said they were monitoring developments without taking any new steps.\", \"Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut issued a statement on Sunday saying local health officials were paying close attention to the Omicron variant.\", \"\\u201cOur team at the Connecticut Department of Public Health, led by Commissioner Manisha Juthani, is following these developments closely,\\u201d he said in the statement. \\u201cWhile there have been no cases of the Omicron variant reported here in Connecticut or the United States to date, we still must be vigilant. Given the number of countries where Omicron has already been detected, it may already be present in the U.S.\\u201d\", \"Other state leaders took the same tone, urging caution as well as highlighting the resources they had already put in place through the pandemic.\", \"Mr. Lamont pointed to the network of labs sequencing genomes in his state and reminded residents to wear masks in indoor public spaces.\", \"Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said on Twitter on Sunday that the state was \\u201cmonitoring the new variant from Southern Africa closely.\\u201d He did not announce any new steps but said that the coronavirus vaccine and booster shot were essential.\", \"The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health echoed that message and said in a statement, \\u201cMore studies are needed to determine whether the Omicron variant is more contagious, more deadly or resistant to vaccine and treatments than other Covid-19 strains.\\u201d The department added that people in Los Angeles should adhere to existing mask requirements.\", \"\\u201cWhile we are still learning much about Omicron, we know enough about Covid to take steps now that can reduce transmission as we prepare to better understand the additional strategies that may needed to mitigate this new variant of concerns,\\u201d the statement said.\", \"Health leaders in the United States have said that it is all but inevitable that the variant will reach the country and called this a time for caution but not panic.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re going to get better information about this,\\u201d Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said on the CNN program \\u201cState of the Union.\\u201d \\u201cBut there\\u2019s no reason to panic. But it is a great reason to go get boosted.\\u201d\", \"Some leaders sought to reassure residents. Gov. Dan McKee of Rhode Island said that its health department was not aware of any cases in the state linked to the variant, although he said that the state would continue to be on the lookout.\", \"\\u201cThe best way to keep RI safe: Get vaccinated. Get your booster,\\u201d he said on Twitter.\", \"On Saturday, his office issued a statement to the Providence-based news outlet GoLocalProv, saying that the state\\u2019s health laboratories already perform genomic surveillance on samples, \\u201cwhich would identify the Omicron variant.\\u201d\", \"In New York, under Ms. Hochul\\u2019s executive order, all state agencies are authorized \\u201cto take appropriate action to assist local governments and individuals\\u201d in containing and responding to cases. Although the measures are a far cry from early pandemic rules, they were the nation\\u2019s first attempt to accelerate preparation for the arrival of Omicron.\", \"\\u201cWe continue to see warning signs of spikes this upcoming winter, and while the new Omicron variant has yet to be detected in New York State, it\\u2019s coming,\\u201d Ms. Hochul said in a release.\", \"Two governors of more conservative-leaning states addressed concerns about the variant, too, but maintained their position that vaccine mandates were off the table for now.\", \"Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas said on \\u201cState of the Union\\u201d that while a new variant \\u201cis a great concern,\\u201d encouraging vaccinations would work better than forcing them.\", \"Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi made similar statements on NBC\\u2019s \\u201cMeet the Press.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re certainly monitoring this new variant,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have all the data that we need to make decisions at this time.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a75c7cfa508c11ecb09f1f5c65fd0d60"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a75c7cfa508c11ecb09f1f5c65fd0d60"}},
