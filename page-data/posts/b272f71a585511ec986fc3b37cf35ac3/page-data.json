Justin Thomas returns as the defending champion with his father, Mike, a longtime PGA professional.\", \"Still, this becomes all about Woods inside the ropes, hitting shots that count toward a score. A year ago, it was his last event before a fifth back surgery, not as serious as the previous ones. Toward the end of the second round, he was not hitting some tee shots because his son played from a forward tee and was getting it out there farther than Woods could have hit it.\", \"Fans are returning to the Florida course, and it already is close to a sellout because organizers limit ticket sales to preserve the intimate nature of the event.\", \"The next question will be when Woods, who shares the career PGA Tour record with 82 victories, will play in an official event.\", \"He had said last week that was a long way off, dousing hopes of a return by suggesting his leg wouldn't allow him to practice as much, he was at peace with that and \\\"I've made the climb enough times.\\\" He also said he hadn't reached a point of deciding whether to complete a full comeback from his latest injuries.\", \"\\\"I'll play a round here or there, a little hit and giggle, I can do something like that,\\\" he said. \\\"To see some of my shots fall out of the sky a lot shorter than they used to is a little eye-opening, but at least I'm able to do it again.
