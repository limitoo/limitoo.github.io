It makes no exceptions for rape or incest.\", \"The law, passed by Republican lawmakers, allows private citizens to enforce the ban, empowering them to sue abortion clinics and anyone else who aids someone in getting the procedure.\", \"The Supreme Court on Friday left the Texas law in place, but allowed abortion providers to challenge the ban. It came just over a week after the court's conservative justices signaled they would roll back abortion rights in a Mississippi case and possibly overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.\", \"In a statement on Saturday night, Newsom, a Democrat who survived a recall vote in September, said he was \\\"outraged\\\" that the high court was \\\"largely endorsing Texas's scheme to insulate its law from the fundamental protections of Roe v. Wade,\\\" which established the constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy in 1973.\", \"\\\"But if states can now shield their laws from review by the federal courts that compare assault weapons to Swiss Army knives, then California will use that authority to protect people's lives, where Texas used it to put women in harm's way,\\\" Newsom added.\", \"California has long banned the manufacture and sale of many assault-style weapons.\", \"A federal court recently overturned the ban, in which the judge compared the AR-15 rifle to a Swiss Army Knife as \\\"good for both home and battle.\\\" California's ban remained in place while the state appealed.\", \"In his statement, Newsom said he has directed his staff to work with the state's Legislature and its attorney general to pass a law that would let private citizens sue to enforce California's ban on assault weapons.\", \"Newsom said people who sue could win up to $10,000 per violation plus other costs and attorneys fees against \\\"anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells an assault weapon or ghost gun kit or parts\\\" in California.\", \"\\\"If the most efficient way to keep these devastating weapons off our streets is to add the threat of private lawsuits, we should to just that,\\\" he added.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949880/gov-gavin-newsom-speaks-during-news-conference.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">California Gov.
