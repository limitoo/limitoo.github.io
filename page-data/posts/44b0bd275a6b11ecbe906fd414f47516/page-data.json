But the vernacular of work life for many has changed just as much as their work has.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-11T10:16:33.000Z","content":"[\"Consider the denizens of the office \\u2014 those figures hunched over their desks typing, pinging, barking into phones, scarfing down salads, sometimes closing the loop, always circling back. They\\u2019d love to touch base. They\\u2019ll do a deep dive, if it moves the needle.\", \"Office lingo signals affiliation with an in-group. But that isn\\u2019t its only function. \\u201cCorporate language serves the purpose of papering over the messiness of being a person with emotions and contradictory impulses,\\u201d said Aparna Nancherla, a comedian who played a human resources representative on the Comedy Central show \\u201cCorporate.\\u201d\", \"During the pandemic, Ms. Nancherla noted, as lives and routines were upended, that sleek language didn\\u2019t always meet the demands of the moment. \\u201cCorporate life is so tied to time and efficiency, and none of that felt like it mattered anymore,\\u201d she continued. \\u201cIt felt like playacting, like keeping up this charade.\\u201d\", \"Still Ms. Nancherla, like millions of other Americans, found herself going through the motions: sending Google calendar invitations, logging onto video calls, adjusting her ring light as the world fell to pieces. New phrases cropped up to label those jarring experiences. There was social distancing, Covidiot, Zoom fatigue. Lexicographers took note of that gloomy vocabulary. In 2020, the digital word of the year was doomscrolling, according to the American Dialect Society. In 2021, burnout made Dictionary.com\\u2019s shortlist.\", \"Employers relied on jargon more than ever, according to Andr\\u00e9 Spicer, a professor at Bayes Business School, City, University of London, because the usual tools they had for building workplace community had disappeared. That meant inventing fresh terms as well as leaning on the classics, like disruption and road map. Then there were oldies that got an update. \\u201cI hope this finds you well\\u201d gained the addendum, \\u201cin these trying and unprecedented times.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIn the past you could communicate culture through physical stuff,\\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \\u201cWhen you go virtual you don\\u2019t have artifacts around, whether it\\u2019s a foosball table or office canteen, so you\\u2019re left with people on screens and words.\\u201d\", \"As some workers prepare to return to their physical workplaces, and many others settle in for a long remote winter, here are the words they may find handy.\", \"Remember the dash outside to buy a prepackaged sandwich, whose contents would end up nestled in the crevices of your laptop keyboard? Or the icy gazes directed toward colleagues who dared to bring in tuna? \\u201cNostalgia about the office seems to have popped up in the hybrid age,\\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \\u201cWhat was ever so good about Lunch al Desko?\\u201d\", \"Some have a copy of Robert Caro\\u2019s \\u201cThe Power Broker\\u201d on display for video calls. Others opt for something subtler \\u2014 maybe \\u201cJude the Obscure,\\u201d which the actor Paul Rudd chose, or Thomas Piketty\\u2019s \\u201cCapital,\\u201d featured behind Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. \\u201cSeeing into every person\\u2019s home, no matter how well you knew them, felt intrusive,\\u201d Ms. Nancherla said. \\u201cBut it was also bonding in that you\\u2019re like, \\u2018You\\u2019re stuck at home like me.\\u2019\\u201d Stars: They\\u2019re quarantined just like us.\", \"When people sit in morning traffic, they owe themselves a treat. Maybe it\\u2019s a scone or a smoothie. Maybe it\\u2019s one of those egg white wraps from Starbucks that probably dates back to the Paleolithic era. Cameron Parkins, who started a new job during the pandemic as a graduate programs administrator in Richmond, impressed his co-workers by making banana cheesecake for his first day at the office. His team appreciated it, he said, maybe even too much: \\u201cThey joked around that it was the real reason they hired me.\\u201d\", \"That office colleague who inexplicably lowers his mask when he has to cough, as if he was the only person in the room. At least he filled out his Covid symptom self-scan this morning.\", \"Working flexibly means more time away from your day job to sell crafts on Etsy, trade cryptocurrencies or write the 2021 twist on \\u201cKing Lear.\\u201d \\u201cWhen you\\u2019re not in the office, it\\u2019s a lot easier to switch back and forth between tasks,\\u201d said the lexicographer Erin McKean, who noted a recent spike in usage of the word \\u201cpolywork,\\u201d a more official-sounding form of the side hustle.\", \"Who knew three little letters could contain so much angst? They became ubiquitous this year, as bosses promised a triumphant Return to Office, only to have their plans hijacked by coronavirus variants. Still, better to talk about a return to the office than a return to work, according to Chris Herd, a technology entrepreneur. \\u201cPeople are genuinely offended about being told they\\u2019re returning to work,\\u201d he said, \\u201cwhen they\\u2019ve been working their socks off for the last 18 months.\\u201d\", \"When offices disappeared, the boundaries between the professional and domestic went with them. Alexis Gay, a comedian who used to work at Patreon, realized early on in the work-from-home era that the seven employees she managed would become intimately familiar with her kitchen. \\u201cIt was like, here\\u2019s my mug, here\\u2019s my plants,\\u201d she said. \\u201cYou were forced to be a little more yourself by nature of the office coming to you.\\u201d Hopefully they\\u2019ll attest to her interior design skills in year-end reviews.\", \"In pre-Covid times, we used to call those moments when we communicated directly with our colleagues the regular old workday. Now, with people scattered across time zones and more apt to set their own hours, those opportunities for real-time conversation are a scarce resource. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve learned to cherish the synchronous time,\\u201d said Joshua Zerkel, head of global engagement marketing at Asana, whose staff members are spread around the globe.\", \"For 18 months, while everyone got newly acquainted with their couches, some said a gleeful farewell to underwire. Now, as blazers and stilettos re-emerge from retirement, the critical question becomes: Does leaving the house mean a bra mandate? \\u201cSaying \\u2018I\\u2019m not going to put on a bra today\\u2019 is something people have control over in a time when we\\u2019ve had little to no control over the world,\\u201d said Ilana Dunn, who is the host of a dating podcast.\", \"Anyone who has entered the eighth hour of staring at a co-worker\\u2019s pores and wished to be back under the fluorescent lighting of an open floor plan knows what it\\u2019s like to turn into a Zoombie, Mr. Spicer said. It\\u2019s almost enough to make you wish the office would come back from the dead.\"]","href_hash":"44b0bd275a6b11ecbe906fd414f47516"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"44b0bd275a6b11ecbe906fd414f47516"}},
