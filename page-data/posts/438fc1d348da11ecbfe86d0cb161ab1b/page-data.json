They argue the procedure and its novel drug combination would be an agonizing death.\", \"Dr. James Williams, an emergency physician at a Texas hospital, told the judge that execution by firing squad would be \\\"very quick.\\\"\", \"\\\"I don't believe the condemned would feel anything that would approximate pain,\\\" he said.\", \"Currently, four states allow execution by firing squad: Mississippi, South Carolina, Oklahoma and Utah. The last inmate shot to death was Ronnie Gardner in Utah in June 2010.\", \"Nevada law currently does not allow inmates to be shot to death.
