Children's safety, wellbeing and access to essential services are all under threat from non-stop horrific violence.\\\"\", \"4.3 million of the country's 7.8 million children have been displaced from their homes, the U.N. agency said. At least 78 children have been confirmed killed and 105 wounded, the U.N. has said, but it acknowledges that because of the difficulty in confirming casualties in the war zone, the true toll is likely much higher.\", \"UNICEF said it was establishing child-friendly spaces across Ukraine and working to increase the number of child protection teams deployed to acute conflict zones. It has also created one-stop safe places outside Ukraine for women and children who have fled the country.\", \"\\\"Children urgently need peace and protection. They need their rights. UNICEF continues to appeal for an immediate cease-fire and for the protection of children from harm. Essential infrastructure on which children depend, including hospitals, schools and buildings sheltering civilians, must never come under attack,\\\" Russel said.\", \"Haley Ott is a digital reporter/producer for CBS News based in London.\"]","href_hash":"64ba9822ab7311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"64ba9822ab7311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
