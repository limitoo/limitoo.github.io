In Auckland and Capital Coast and Hutt Valley DHBs the outbreak has gone up quite quickly and down again quite quickly, he said.\", \"\\\"We're seeing a different pattern in the regions where the outbreak develops more slowly and there is a more sustained peak. Good examples of this are in the Waikato and in the Southern District Health Board which covers not just Dunedin but the Otago and Southland areas.\\\"\", \"Dr Bloomfield said the number of deaths per million people is now 59, but New Zealand still has the lowest cumulative death rate from Covid-19 of any OECD country.\", \"Hospitalisations are declining, particularly in the Northern region, he said, and a pattern of generally lower hospitalisation rates was being seen out in the regions. Tair\\u0101whiti has had the highest case rate in the country in the past two weeks but only ever had just a handful of hospitalisations.\", \"Dr Bloomfield said the lower hospitalisation rates in some of the regions \\\"was actually a little bit puzzling\\\".
