Frey opposed the policing amendment. Two of his leading challengers in the field of 17 candidates, Sheila Nezhad and Kate Knuth, strongly supported the proposal.\", \"The proposed amendment to the city charter would remove language that mandates that Minneapolis have a police department with a minimum number of officers based on population.\", \"Supporters of the change argued that a complete overhaul of policing is necessary to stop police violence. They framed it as a chance to re-imagine what public safety can be and to devote more funding toward new approaches that don't rely on sending armed officers to deal with people in crisis.\", \"But opponents said the ballot proposal contained no concrete plan for how the new department would operate and expressed fear that it might make communities already affected by gun violence even more vulnerable to rising crime. The details, and who would lead the new agency, would be determined by the mayor and the City Council.\", \"Two nationally prominent progressive Democratic leaders \\u2014 U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who represents the Minneapolis area, and state Attorney General Keith Ellison \\u2014 both supported the policing amendment. But some leading mainstream liberals, including Gov. Tim Walz and U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, opposed it and feared the backlash could lead to Democratic losses across the country in 2022.\", \"Support didn't cleanly follow racial lines. Opponents included several prominent Black leaders, including some who have been top voices in the police accountability movement.\", \"While results from the ballot questions were expected Tuesday night, the mayoral race was a question mark because the city uses ranked choice voting. If no candidate reaches 50 percent in the first round of counting, the winner would be determined after a tally Wednesday of second- and potentially third-choice votes.\"]","href_hash":"0ac73d443bf611ec9c53000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0ac73d443bf611ec9c53000017025a03"}},
