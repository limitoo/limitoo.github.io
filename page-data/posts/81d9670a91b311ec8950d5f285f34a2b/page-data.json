Periodic rocket firings are required to maintain the desired orbit.\", \"Krein said the Northrop Grumman spacecraft is now equipped with a \\\"gimbaled delta velocity engine, or DVE, that will allow Cygnus to provide reboost, or orbit-raising capability, for station during berthed operations.\\\" The first such maneuver is expected in April.\", \"Unlike SpaceX's all-American Dragon cargo ship and Falcon 9 rocket, the Cygnus and its Antares 230+ booster include major components built in other countries. The RD-181 engines are built by NPO Energomash in Russia and other major elements of the first stage are provided by KB Yuzhnoye/Yuzhmash in Ukraine.\", \"Asked about the company's contingency plans given the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kurt Eberly, Northrop Grumman director of space launch, said \\\"we're obviously monitoring the situation, and hopefully it can be resolved.\\\"\", \"In the meantime, \\\"we have all of the hardware we need for all the missions we have on contract with NASA,\\\" he said. \\\"So that includes NG-17, 18 and 19. All that hardware is here at Wallops. And so, hopefully, that will tide us over until these tensions can subside and we can be back to normal operating procedure.\\\" \", \"Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News.
