Texas had made a similar decision days earlier.\", \"States can ask the Treasury Department to reallocate unused money already authorized by Congress to fund rent-relief programs across the country, and Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York has requested that an additional $1 billion be shifted to New York. A final decision has not yet been made in Washington on new disbursements.\", \"In New York, lawmakers included a unique protection as part of the state\\u2019s program: landlords are barred from evicting tenants while an application with the state is pending. Housing advocates and some elected leaders have argued that New York, by closing the door on new applications, removed one of the key protections against eviction in a state with a huge number of renters and where the economic rebound has lagged.\", \"That decision has taken on greater significance because a state moratorium on evictions is set to expire next month. The lawsuit filed on Monday on behalf of the plaintiffs by the Legal Aid Society, a nonprofit based in New York City, seeks to force the state to reopen the applications and extend those protections to people who may not have yet applied for rent relief but are still behind on rent.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s an easy thing for them to do, at no cost to themselves, and will help a lot of people,\\u201d said Edward Josephson, supervising attorney of the group\\u2019s law reform unit.\", \"The lawsuit argues that state officials violated the law that set up the program because they closed down the application process before \\u201call potential sources of funds\\u201d were exhausted.\", \"State officials declined to comment on pending litigation. But they said that about 120,000 applications already pending that, even if qualified, would not receive rent relief without more federal aid. They also said that the state is trying to help tenants through other programs, including $25 million in legal aid for renters.\", \"There is no comprehensive measure of how many people are behind on rent. According to New York\\u2019s most recent figures, more than $1.1 billion in rent relief had been paid, with another $924 million approved for tenants where paperwork from landlords was still needed for the payments to be disbursed.\", \"Gov. Kathy Hochul has asked the federal government for almost $1 billion in additional funding. But according to the state office of temporary and disability assistance, the agency administering the program, the Treasury Department has informed New York that it would likely not be getting its full request.\", \"Many people have not even applied, Mr. Josephson said. One of those people is Maria Hidalgo, a plaintiff in the lawsuit, who owes more than $8,000 but only found out about the program in late November \\u2014 after the state stopped accepting applications.\", \"Ms. Hidalgo, a Bronx resident, said her landlord had sent her several notices of the amount of rent she owes, and she did not know where she would stay if she was evicted. She said that since she lost her job as a cook at a local church in May 2020, she has been unable to find steady work. She said she has felt depressed.\"]","href_hash":"3fc98c065ce211ec9f9a3559d8baf745"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3fc98c065ce211ec9f9a3559d8baf745"}},
