Honed over decades, his starkly drawn tableaus of abstract lines and shapes, lit with minute precision, have adorned Shakespeare plays and Philip Glass operas alike.\", \"And Wilson, who turned 80 in October, isn\\u2019t about to depart from that formula.\", \"Last week, as the Paris Opera put the finishing touches on his production of Puccini\\u2019s \\u201cTurandot,\\u201d which premiered at the Teatro Real in 2018 and opens here with a preview for young audiences on Wednesday, Wilson zeroed in on the minuscule imperfections, nudging performers centimeters closer to their marks. A misshapen reflection of the moon on the stage brought rehearsal to a stop. As the lighting team scrambled to fix the spot, he turned to them and asked, \\u201cWhere is it?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSome of his shows have 2,000 light cues, so you have to be very organized,\\u201d John Torres, a lighting designer who has worked with Wilson for a decade, said during a rehearsal break. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a little bit of a puzzle.\\u201d\", \"Wilson has 184 stage productions to his name, along with many revivals, and neither age nor the pandemic have slowed him down. \\u201cI forget that I\\u2019m 80, because I\\u2019m fortunate that I\\u2019m still working,\\u201d he said in an interview at the Op\\u00e9ra Bastille. \\u201cI\\u2019m booked for the next two years, solid.\\u201d\", \"In Paris alone this fall, Wilson has brought four shows to stages around town. In addition to \\u201cTurandot,\\u201d his \\u201cJungle Book,\\u201d a 2019 musical inspired by Rudyard Kipling, brought stilted animals to the Th\\u00e9\\u00e2tre du Ch\\u00e2telet. He also reunited with the choreographer Lucinda Childs, with whom he staged Glass\\u2019s landmark \\u201cEinstein on the Beach\\u201d in 1976: As part of the Paris Autumn Festival, they presented a new creation (\\u201cBach 6 Solo\\u201d) and a revival (\\u201cI Was Sitting on My Patio This Guy Appeared I Thought I Was Hallucinating,\\u201d from 1977).\", \"While Europe has long celebrated Wilson as one of the most important directors of the past century, he has been less of a prophet at home. His boundary-pushing artistic statements \\u2014 \\u201cDeafman Glance,\\u201d a hit in France in 1971, was seven hours long and wordless \\u2014 never secured him regular commissions in the United States, even though Wilson has had what he calls his own arts \\u201claboratory,\\u201d the Watermill Center on Long Island, which will celebrate its 30th anniversary next year.\", \"Speaking about his busy Paris season, Wilson said that he probably won\\u2019t have as many productions in New York \\u201cuntil I die.\\u201d His longstanding disdain for naturalism hasn\\u2019t helped. \\u201cWhat are they thinking about, in these dramas in New York?\\u201d he asked. \\u201cThey have all this psychology. Does it have to be that complicated?\\u201d\", \"In lieu of psychology, Wilson\\u2019s work is driven by image and sound, and was shaped by early encounters with forward-looking choreographers. After a difficult youth as the gay son of a conservative family in Texas, where he initially studied business administration, Wilson moved to New York in 1963 and discovered the work of Merce Cunningham and, especially, George Balanchine, whose large repertoire of plotless ballets have Wilson\\u2019s favor. (Nonetheless, he admitted to liking Balanchine\\u2019s ever-popular \\u201cNutcracker\\u201d staging, a fixture of the holiday season at New York City Ballet and elsewhere.)\", \"\\u201cThat changed my life,\\u201d Wilson said. \\u201cI thought that if theater could be like that, if opera could be like that, then I was interested.\\u201d\", \"Wilson approaches theater and opera in the same way. Even when he works with straightforward plays, as in his production of Shakespeare\\u2019s \\u201cThe Tempest\\u201d that opened in October in Sofia, Bulgaria, sentences tend to be distorted in artificial ways.\", \"\\u201cHis take on text is almost strictly musical,\\u201d said the French performer Yuming Hey, who plays Mowgli in \\u201cJungle Book.\\u201d In an email, Childs, the choreographer, said that \\u201crhythm and timing are his foremost concerns\\u201d and that Wilson\\u2019s vision \\u201chasn\\u2019t changed\\u201d much in the five decades she has known him.\", \"In fact, Wilson\\u2019s aesthetic has been singularly consistent, down to details like the white makeup performers wear and their stylized hand gestures. To his critics, this sameness glosses over the differences between the works he stages. To Wilson, it\\u2019s just a way of acknowledging that a stage is \\u201cunlike any other space in the world,\\u201d as he told the cast of \\u201cTurandot,\\u201d and to craft visuals that help the audience \\u201chear better than with their eyes closed.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cTo see someone try to act natural onstage seems so artificial,\\u201d he said in an interview later. \\u201cIf you accept it as being something artificial, in the long run, it seems more natural, for me.\\u201d\", \"Hey said that during preparations for \\u201cJungle Book,\\u201d the first step for him was to learn what he called \\u201cWilson\\u2019s grammar,\\u201d which is often taught by assistant stagers. In auditions, he was given exercises with directions such as \\u201cstand still, like a sun, and shine while keeping the position and staying focused.\\u201d\", \"Somewhat paradoxically, Wilson\\u2019s work has consistently been described as avant-garde as other aesthetic trends have come and gone. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a very interesting word, because for me, avant-garde means to rediscover the classics,\\u201d Wilson said. \\u201cAll my works are based on classical patterns.\\u201d\", \"Work, for Wilson and his team, starts at 7 a.m. and often extends late into the evening. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just what he does, so he kind of expects everyone to do the same,\\u201d said Julian Mommert, who was Wilson\\u2019s assistant for two years and now works as international relations and tour manager for the choreographer Dimitris Papaioannou. Mommert remembered Wilson as \\u201cvery open and funny and warm,\\u201d but ultimately left in 2014, because of exhaustion.\", \"Wilson\\u2019s only break each year is a one-week trip to Bali around Christmas. \\u201cI go to a very modest hotel,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been going there for 30-something years, and no one knows who I am. I like the people; I like the food.\\u201d\", \"Wilson didn\\u2019t even take a substantial break during the pandemic. In 2020, he spent several months in Berlin, at the Akademie der K\\u00fcnste. \\u201cI had a beautiful studio and I made lots of drawings,\\u201d he said. How did he fare away from the stage? \\u201cOf course one is upset, but working is like breathing. I just kept on breathing.\\u201d\", \"Still, the forced pause had \\u201ca tremendous impact\\u201d on his production machine, Wilson said. Performances were canceled, along with the Watermill Center\\u2019s 2020 summer festival and gala \\u2014 which, he said, typically brings in \\u201cas much as 2 or 2.4 million\\u201d dollars. For summer 2021, because of travel restrictions, he did not invite his usual international roster of guests and residents but more local artists instead, for a weeklong festival organization with the artist Carrie Mae Weems.\", \"\\u201cWork for me is not really work; it\\u2019s a way of living,\\u201d Wilson said. \\u201cI\\u2019m still the same person I was when I first started working in the theater.\\u201d\", \"And at the Paris Opera, behind his single-minded focus and solemn demeanor, a hint of playfulness occasionally resurfaced with the cast of \\u201cTurandot.\\u201d Wilson described the opera as \\u201ca fairy tale, another world,\\u201d in which the Chinese princess Turandot, who initially refuses to marry, \\u201cis having fun being evil.\\u201d His minimalist aesthetic steers clear of orientalism, although the comic trio of ministers, renamed Jim, Bob and Bill when the production was performed by the Canadian Opera Company in 2019, are here restored as Ping, Pang and Pong.\", \"\\u201cThe reason we make theater is to have fun,\\u201d Wilson told the singers. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t take this work too seriously.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3f66b96e51fc11eca74abd1f68e8bcd2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3f66b96e51fc11eca74abd1f68e8bcd2"}},
