Instead, they suggested, participants who could do so should watch the proceedings online.\", \"It was the last straw for many attendees, especially environmentalists and delegates from developing countries who endured long journeys and logistical hurdles to get to Glasgow during the pandemic. The past few days, the conference limited the number of people allowed inside the venue from civil society groups. The online portals to watch the negotiations remotely have been faulty. \", \"On Tuesday, conference organizers issued a letter of apology to participants for the long lines and video difficulties, saying that planning around Covid restrictions has been challenging. On Wednesday afternoon, Patricia Espinosa, the executive secretary of the U.N. climate body, asked attendees to \\u201cbear with us\\u201d as organizers grappled with the complex arrangements \\u2014 which include ensuring that all those entering the venue have tested negative for the coronavirus, and enforcing controls on the number of people in meeting rooms.\", \"\\u201cThis is a unique COP in quite extraordinary times,\\u201d added Alok Sharma, the British politician who is serving as host of the conference. He said organizers are \\u201cworking to fix\\u201d logistical issues but did not offer details.\", \"They also did not address criticisms over issuing accreditation for 39,509 people to access a venue whose the capacity is limited to 10,000. \", \"One veteran of the annual summit \\u2014 known as COP26 because it is the 26th \\u201cconference of the parties\\u201d to the U.N.\\u2019s climate body \\u2014 called it the \\u201cpoorest planed\\u201d to date. Alexandria Villase\\u00f1or, a youth activist from the United States, called the conference a \\u201chellscape.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAn exclusionary, racist, ableist, classist environment directly informs the decision making process that is placed in it!\\u201d Ms. Villase\\u00f1or wrote on Twitter. \", \"Asad Rehman, director of a coalition of labor, youth, racial justice and other groups focused on climate change, derided the \\u201cshabbiest organizing\\u201d he\\u2019s seen in 15 years of attending U.N. climate conferences. He said that some negotiators told him they had to cancel bilateral meetings because they were unable to get inside in time.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s mounting anger about this issue of accessibility and inclusion, and huge, huge frustration not just from developing countries but also negotiators,\\u201d Mr. Rehman said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s probably the poorest planned COP I\\u2019ve ever seen.\\u201d\", \"\"]","href_hash":"b074ad3a3cb911ec919f000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b074ad3a3cb911ec919f000017025a03"}},
