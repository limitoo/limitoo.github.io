The same day, former Trump administration official Steve Bannon was indicted by a grand jury for criminal contempt of Congress over his refusal to comply with a select committee subpoena.\", \"MSNBC resurfaced a clip of Meadows, who was key to promoting Trump's election fraud claims, complaining during a July 2018 Fox News interview that then Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had not complied with congressional subpoenas. That interview came as Meadows and Representative Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, filed impeachment articles against Rosenstein due to their frustration with his actions.\", \"\\\"For nine months we've asked for documents\\u2014and that's all we want are the documents. And what we found is not only have subpoenas been ignored, but information has been hidden. The efforts have been stonewalled,\\\" Meadows told Fox News host Laura Ingraham at the time.\", \"\\\"And I guess for us, it's all about transparency so the American people can judge for themselves,\\\" he said. \\\"So they may be able to ignore Congress but they can't ignore the American people.\\\"\", \"Although Meadows quickly backed off his impeachment threat against Rosenstein in 2018, it came as a result of the latter's involvement in the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. \\\"Multiple times we've caught DOJ officials hiding information from Congress, withholding relevant documents, or even outright ignoring congressional subpoena,\\\" Meadows said in a statement at the time.\", \"As it did with Bannon Friday, the House select committee has threatened to issue a criminal referral against Meadows due to his refusal to comply with its subpoena. Representative Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chairs the select committee, warned Meadows' attorney in a Thursday letter that he had \\\"no valid legal basis\\\" for his \\\"continued resistance to the Select Committee's subpoena.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931966/mark-meadows.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A video has resurfaced showing Mark Meadows, Trump's White House chief of staff, complaining in 2018 about subpoenas being ignored.
