The answer in which I said that National completely agreed with the statement was based on an incorrect interpretation of the question. This is not my view, nor that of National.\\\"\", \"He went on to say the vaccine is the \\\"best way for people to protect themselves, their whanau and the country\\\", and that National supports the vaccination rollout.\", \"\\\"However, Government mandates that require use of proof of vaccination should be limited and cease to be used after vaccine targets are hit.\", \"\\\"National believes in private property rights, free enterprise and freedom of choice. We are comfortable with businesses requiring proof of vaccination for entry - for example, a bar deciding they will only serve vaccinated customers, or a music festival deciding vaccination is required to attend. However, this should be over to the business to determine and over to individuals to decide.\", \"\\u00a0\\\"I'd like to take this opportunity to be clear that I am not someone who holds anti-vax views. I ask my Whangapar\\u0101oa community and all New Zealanders to go and get vaccinated. It is the most important tool in our fight against COVID and is perfectly safe.\\\"\", \"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Saturday told Newshub Nation use of vaccine certificates wouldn't be permanent, and would be lifted once high vaccination rates were achieved nationwide.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Earlier this week, National MP Harete Hipango was spotted at an anti-vaccination protest in Whanganui.
