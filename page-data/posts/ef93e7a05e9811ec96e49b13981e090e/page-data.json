According to a statement from French Prime Minister Jean Castex, they apply to vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.\", \"Only non-French people and French citizens with \\\"an urgent health or legal reason\\\" will be allowed to travel from France to the U.K.\", \"EU citizens and long-term residents will still be able to enter France via the U.K. Besides groups of people such as diplomats and health care workers, other non-EU travelers will be barred from entering the country.\", \"Some critics of the measure wondered whether the new restrictions are politically motivated.\", \"Max Blain, a spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, said bans such as these \\\"wouldn't be effective or proportionate,\\\" adding that Johnson does not have any plans to implement a similar measure against France.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1953250/paris-france-covid-19.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The French government announced it would put restrictions on people traveling to and from the United Kingdom.
