Thinking that the protesters were too close to their house and ignoring signs about their street being private, the McCloskeys pointed their guns at the group until it passed, with no shots fired.\", \"In their new claim, the pair cited their belief that the \\\"350 to 500\\\" demonstrators threatened them, their daughter and their property and said their actions were justified because they felt the protest could become \\\"unlawful and violent\\\" like others around the country if they did not intervene, according to KCUR.\", \"Special prosecutor Richard Callahan has said his investigation determined that the protesters were peaceful.\", \"\\\"There was no evidence that any of them had a weapon and no one I interviewed realized they had ventured onto a private enclave,\\\" Callahan said in a news release after the McCloskeys pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges.\", \"They pleaded guilty to various assault and harassment charges in June, when they were fined $2,750 and required to give up their weapons.
