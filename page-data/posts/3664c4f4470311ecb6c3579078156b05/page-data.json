The German network regulator Bundesnetzagentur suspended the channel until further notice. The regulator is meant to certify the Nord Stream 2 AG as an independent transmission operator in Germany, which is required to flow into the country. The suspension of the pipeline's services was because they were unsure of the status of the pipeline's ownership.\", \"\\\"Following a thorough examination of the documentation,\\\" said the regulator in a statement, \\\"the Bundesnetzagentur concluded that it would only be possible to certify an operator of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if that operator was organized in a legal form under German law.\\\"\", \"In response to the suspension, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline operators said that it \\\"has decided not to transform its existing legal form but instead to found a subsidiary under German law solely to govern the German part of the pipeline.\\\"\", \"\\\"This will create a favorable situation\\u2014at any rate, a better situation\\u2014in the European energy market in general,\\\" said Russian President Vladimir Putin during a press conference in October.\", \"Nord Stream 2 AG has said that it cannot comment on the certification process.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1933395/nord-stream-sign.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A sign reading \\\"Nord Stream 2 Committed.
