So says a selection of baseball writers from North America. But writers at The Times didn\\u2019t have a vote. They haven\\u2019t had one for more than 30 years.\", \"Members of the Baseball Writers\\u2019 Association of America vote for four annual awards in both the National and American Leagues: the Most Valuable Player (Mr. Ohtani and Mr. Harper), Cy Young (for the best pitchers), Rookie of the Year and Manager of the Year. But a handful of organizations don\\u2019t allow their writers to take part in the process. The Times is one of them. The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post are two others.\", \"The rationale for The Times\\u2019s rule: Journalists should report the news, not help make it.\", \"The prohibition applies to other sporting honors such as Hall of Fame nominations and college football\\u2019s Heisman Trophy, and cultural honors like the Tony Awards or film festivals. A Cy Young or a Tony might change the trajectory of a performer\\u2019s career. Sometimes winners receive contract bonuses from their teams. (Mr. Harper earned an additional $500,000 for his M.V.P. award.)\", \"\\u201cCooperation of this sort puts the paper\\u2019s independence into question,\\u201d states The Times\\u2019s Ethical Journalism Handbook, under a banner titled \\u201cProtecting the Paper\\u2019s Neutrality.\\u201d\", \"The B.B.W.A.A. was founded in 1908 and works with Major League Baseball and its clubs to formalize working conditions for journalists at ballparks. It also established the annual awards; two writers from every league city submit ballots. Writers with 10 years of membership may also elect players to the Hall of Fame.\", \"Voters, who spend all season observing play and tracking the athletes, are expected to provide unbiased decisions.\", \"\\u201cWe need well-informed writers to conduct those elections,\\u201d said Tyler Kepner, national baseball reporter at The Times and a member of the B.B.W.A.A.\", \"The Times\\u2019s prohibition on voting dates to 1989. Max Frankel, the executive editor, revisited the roles reporters and editors played in awards and honors while the newspaper was expanding its sports and local New York coverage. He did not doubt the integrity of Times reporters, but felt that voting could make for a conflict of interest, or at least the appearance of one.\", \"\\u201cOur growing sophistication in spotting fraud in government, business, sports, and even science made us progressively aware of our own vulnerability to conflicts of interest, real and apparent,\\u201d wrote Mr. Frankel, 91, in his memoir, published in 1999, \\u201cThe Times of My Life and My Life With The Times.\\u201d\", \"One sticking point appeared to the Baseball Hall of Fame vote. Some argued for it to be an exception to the new rule.\", \"In a memo written by Mr. Frankel in December 1990, he concluded that \\u201cThe Times assigns staffers to write about baseball for only one reason: to inform and to entertain our readers.\\u201d\", \"Before he joined The Times in 2000, Mr. Kepner voted for the Cy Young Award in his previous positions as a reporter at The Seattle Post-Intelligencer and The Riverside Press-Enterprise in California. He said The Times\\u2019s policy was well-known at the time.\", \"\\u201cI can see the difficulty of voting for or against players on your beat, but I believe most if not all writers accept the responsibility without regard to upsetting or placating those they cover,\\u201d Mr. Kepner said. \\u201cI can certainly understand The Times\\u2019s rationale of sticking to covering the news and not becoming part of the news.\\u201d\", \"The B.B.W.A.A. began listing full voting results for league awards on its website in 2012, and the internet has allowed for instant criticism. Writers often share how and why they voted online. After Corbin Burnes, who pitches for the Milwaukee Brewers, was awarded the N.L. Cy Young Award in a close vote last week, fans and writers debated the case of the second-place finisher, Zack Wheeler of Philadelphia, who led the league in innings pitched but had a slightly higher earned run average.\", \"These tough decisions, now more visible to the public, are typical for the writers, who submit their ballots before the postseason.\", \"\\u201cThe Times\\u2019s rule does save me a lot of aggravation and criticism, especially in the social media age, from people who would disagree with my selections,\\u201d Mr. Kepner said. \\u201cFor peace of mind, it\\u2019s not so bad.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"0d8d59c64b7f11ecaa1c65446754d144"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0d8d59c64b7f11ecaa1c65446754d144"}},
