missing from the discussion in Australia.\\u00a0\", \"The Queenslander, now University of St Andrews psychology student, has launched her own crowdfunded campaign to give a voice to those impacted the most by climate change and Australia's net-zero emissions plan: farmers and miners.\", \"\\\"I was becoming increasingly frustrated with the way we were really talking about the movement and about the inclusivity of the movement, particularly in regional Queensland,\\\" Ms Rogers said.\", \"Ms Rogers' campaign 'It's what Queenslanders do'\\u00a0began as a research project conducted at St Andrews, based off research from the University of Queensland, showing that although regional Queenslanders cared about climate change\\u00a0they were not engaging with the movement because it was unrelatable.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b8ecd87499284f296acf8d774ce74e84\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Charlie\\u00a0Rogers says the voices of graziers\\u00a0and miners\\u00a0are missing from the climate change discussion.(Supplied: Charlie\\u00a0Rogers)</div>\", \"\\\"It's more persuasive and more effective to talk with in-group messengers, which is just a technical term for relatable locals, than it is out-of-group messengers,\\\" she said.\", \"The campaign aims to share the views of miners and graziers about climate change through a range of platforms, including social media, a website\\u00a0and TV advertising\\u00a0in the lead up to the 2022 election.\", \"\\\"We found there was a really important role that miners and farmers played, particularly because of the important role regional Queensland plays in production for the rest of the country,\\\" she said.\", \"The federal government recently announced a plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, but limited details were available on how this would be achieved.\", \"There were also fears, particularly within the coal community, as to what this might mean for employment.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Key voices missing from discussion</div>\", \"Beef producers Bruce Currie and Mick Alexander, along with coal mining supervisor Grant Howard, are three local voices involved in the campaign.\", \"Mr Currie is based on a cattle property north of Jericho in central-west Queensland.\", \"<img

Queensland.(Supplied: Exit Ghost Productions)</div>\", \"\\\"It's important when you get a chance, to speak up and express your concerns for not only your own business, and the impacts climate change will have on that, but also rural and regional Queensland in general and the agricultural sector,\\\" he said.\", \"Mr Alexander, who is based near Rockhampton, agreed that farmers needed to speak out more on climate change.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d7c7d8c70f3e551adbbe6449fd4c4e47\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Central Queensland Grazier Mick Alexander says farmers \\\"feel the heat\\\"\\u00a0when it comes to climate change.(Supplied: Exit Ghost Productions)</div>\", \"\\\"We're the canary in a coal mine, so to speak, because we\\u00a0as farmers\\u00a0feel the heat more than anyone else,\\\" he said.\", \"Grant Howard, a coalmine supervisor in the Bowen basin, said discussions to date had not only excluded miners but also made them feel \\\"threatened\\\".\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/2699e031887d9ffef79a91af3040919e\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

remain within the coal community as to what the plan may mean for employment, despite the Prime Minister's assurances it will have a minimal impact on workers.\\u00a0\", \"Likewise, the agriculture industry is central in Australia's path to net zero.\", \"The sector generates about 15 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"The federal government forecasts up to 17 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent could be sequestered in soil carbon projects by 2050.\", \"Industry lobby groups maintain increased visibility is important on the road ahead.\", \"AgForce CEO Michael Guerin said the agricultural industry wanted to contribute to the work being done in this area.\", \"\\\"We can contribute to challenges of climate and work for better outcomes for landscapes, biodiversity, putting carbon in soil etc,\\\" Mr Guerin said.\", \"\\\"The biggest thing we need to fundamentally change is to take a new, positive forward-looking approach where a producer is an equal at the table.\\\"\", \"The chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council, Ian MacFarlane, said a collaborative approach from all sectors was needed to address climate change.\", \"\\\"The solution to climate change and global emissions lies with every single person in the world.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Graziers playing their part</div>\", \"Mr Currie hoped that,\\u00a0by ramping up conversations about climate change, more graziers would drive down their own environmental footprint.\", \"\\\"Do everything you can to reduce your carbon emissions and your methane emissions and send a very strong message to your political leaders that if they're not proactive in every area of addressing climate change, that you won't vote for them,\\\" he said.\", \"Mr Alexander said operating in an\\u00a0environmentally conscious manner was integral to his business.\", \"\\\"It's one of those things that we need to be thinking about all the time, whenever there's spare cash on hand,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"[We need to be] putting those funds into programs that are going to hold up more water, that are going to increase ground cover, that are going to help us to build our carbon back in our soils.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"e92a492653bd11ec9d1c071c06609109"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e92a492653bd11ec9d1c071c06609109"}},
