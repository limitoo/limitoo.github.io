The first chance racers had to survey and practice on the course \\u2014 or the racecourses for any of the nine other individual Alpine events \\u2014 was a few days ago. The surface under racers\\u2019 skis will also be something new for an Olympic venue: It is made entirely of artificial snow, because the area typically receives just a few inches of natural snow.\", \"In the first of three scheduled downhill training runs on Thursday, about a third of the racers did not negotiate all of the gates. In the second training run on Friday, racers were beginning to grasp the undulating terrain, which has several blind humps and will demand that racers reach speeds approaching 90 miles an hour. But after runs by only three racers, a third and final training run on Saturday was canceled because of high winds, which are common to the area and add another treacherous element to an event that requires racers to fly as far as 60 yards off a series of jumps.\", \"The cancellation of the third training opportunity outraged many racers and their coaches because most competitors use their last practice attempt on the course as a trial run for the tactics and the path between the gates, known as the line, that they hope to employ on Sunday. But on Saturday, race officials deemed the gusting winds unsafe, potentially a recurring, unpredictable weather condition for Alpine races at the site.\", \"Aleksander Aamodt Kilde of Norway, the race favorite and one of three skiers who completed Saturday\\u2019s training run, said organizers had been correct in canceling the training.\", \"\\u201cWith the wind, it\\u2019s kind of crazy, because you gain so much speed some places and then you suddenly lose speed in other places,\\u201d Kilde said. \\u201cIt is coming from every direction, so it\\u2019s really hard to control it.\\u201d\", \"Kilde, who leads this season\\u2019s World Cup downhill standings, had the fastest training run in Friday\\u2019s training session. He will be challenged by the Austrians Matthias Mayer, who won the event in 2014, and Vincent Kriechmayr, and two Swiss racers: Beat Feuz and Marco Odermatt, who is this season\\u2019s World Cup overall leader. Italy\\u2019s Dominik Paris is another racer with a strong downhill racing pedigree.\", \"The top American contenders are Bryce Bennett, Travis Ganong and Ryan Cochran-Siegle. No American has earned a medal in the event since Bode Miller won the bronze at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.\"]","href_hash":"aff523d486e811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"aff523d486e811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
