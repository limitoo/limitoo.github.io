The Thanksgiving sharpies may be breathing easy \\u2014 their plans for next week locked down and ingredients secured, pies and stock in the freezer, wines lined up on the windowsill \\u2014 but I\\u2019m thinking today about those unused to cooking the feast.\", \"It\\u2019s intimidating, after all, to cook Thanksgiving, and especially to do so for the first time, for the second time, for a new family, under different circumstances. It\\u2019s all new: this bird the size of a toddler, the multiple side dishes, the need for dessert. What comes first and what comes second? How do you manage to make all that food and serve it so that at least some of it\\u2019s hot at the same time? Yikes!\", \"Eric Kim comes to the rescue in The Times this week with his smart look at a beginner\\u2019s Thanksgiving, along with seven recipes that will ensure success: a salt-and-pepper roast turkey breast (above) with make-ahead umami gravy and lemony cranberry relish, alongside cheesy pizza stuffing; mashed sweet potatoes with roasted garlic; a green bean, artichoke and radicchio salad; and a caramel apple pudding for dessert. For first-time Thanksgiving cooks, or really anyone looking to simplify their time in the kitchen this year, it\\u2019s an invaluable guide.\", \"Many people, of course, don\\u2019t fall into either camp. They\\u2019re neither Thanksgiving newbies nor seasoned professionals. They\\u2019re simply trying to make the holiday meal the best that it can be. If that\\u2019s you or someone you\\u2019d like to be, here\\u2019s Genevieve Ko\\u2019s examination of a better way to make mashed potatoes, with a recipe to match.\", \"There\\u2019s much to be thankful for in Reem Kassis\\u2019s look into the joys of the Arab American Thanksgiving table and, in particular, at hashweh, a rice-based stuffing fragrant with cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice that is often the centerpiece of celebratory meals. (While you\\u2019re browsing for rice dishes, take a look at this fine vegetable biryani that is sometimes part of Desi Thanksgiving tables as well.)\", \"Maybe you\\u2019ll thrill to Yewande Komolafe\\u2019s new recipe for sweet potato biscuits, or to Samantha Seneviratne\\u2019s cranberry crumb muffins, which like so many of our Thanksgiving breads you could absolutely make ahead and freeze.\", \"And, for inspiration regardless of your level of skill in the kitchen, here\\u2019s Melissa Clark\\u2019s instructions for a one-pan, one-pot Thanksgiving dinner, which you can watch her make on our YouTube channel.\", \"There are thousands and thousands more recipes for Thanksgiving and for cooking right now waiting for you on New York Times Cooking. (I\\u2019d like this roasted fish with ginger, scallions and soy for dinner tonight.) Not to put too fine a point on it, but you do need a subscription to access them. Subscriptions support our work.

And if I can\\u2019t quite rave the novel, I\\u2019ll say this about Ballerini: I\\u2019d listen to that guy read minutes from a meeting of the town council.
