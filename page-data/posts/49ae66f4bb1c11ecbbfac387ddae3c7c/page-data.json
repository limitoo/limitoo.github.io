Seen in a yellow top is Megan Waterman in her final hours.\", \"\\\"We believe she did leave the hotel that night to meet her killer,\\\" Harrison said. \\\"We hope that anyone who may have been in the area that night or many have seen any of the individuals depicted in these videos will reach out to our Crime Stoppers hotline [800-220-TIPS].\\\"\", \"Police say they hope to jog memories and they're doubling the reward for information to $50,000 for information that leads to an arrest and conviction.\", \"Waterman was one of six sex workers killed, found along with the remains of five other people.\", \"Videos appear on a revamped\\u00a0GilgoNews.com\\u00a0website, a renewed effort by a task force that includes talking to sex trafficking victims in jail.\", \"\\\"Gain their trust and ultimately get them to tell us who is responsible, in their opinion, for these heinous crimes,\\\" Suffolk County Undersheriff Kevin Catalina said.\", \"The bodies were all found due to the initial search for missing woman Shannan Gilbert.
