Wells: Changing the World.”","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-19T17:04:40.000Z","content":"[\"THE YOUNG H. G. WELLSChanging the WorldBy Claire Tomalin\", \"Toward the end of Claire Tomalin\\u2019s well-researched biography \\u201cThe Young H. G. Wells: Changing the World,\\u201d she writes:\", \"\\u201cI set out to write a book about the young Wells, covering his formation, the years in which he worked, thought and developed his skills as a writer. \\u2026 He was playful, fun to be with, attractive to women and eager for sex. He had strongly held political views favoring social equality, republicanism and the establishment of world government. He saw himself as a working writer, not an artist in an ivory tower; he was rightly proud of his achievements, and expected to be well paid for his work. And he could be unreliable, selfish and even vengeful.\\u201d\", \"This reader shares Tomalin\\u2019s fascination with her complex subject because Herbert George Wells (1866-1946), a towering genius successful in many genres, knew, influenced or was admired by virtually every major writer and thinker of his time, between the publication of his first novel, \\u201cThe Time Machine,\\u201d in 1895 and the end of World War II. (Every writer of speculative fiction since then will forever be in his debt.) This list is astonishing for its diversity, including such figures as Winston Churchill, Wells\\u2019s teacher Thomas H. Huxley, Bertrand Russell, Conan Doyle, Joseph Conrad, Stephen Crane, George Bernard Shaw, Henry James, George Orwell, Aldous Huxley and architects of the Bolshevik Revolution. As Tomalin writes, \\u201chis celebrity was immense,\\u201d and as Shaw observed, Wells had in his late-Victorian world \\u201cevery social circle in the kingdom open to him.\\u201d\", \"But he was not born into wealth or privilege, though he and his mother, Sarah, a woman \\u201cdeeply religious and devoted to the Church of England,\\u201d saw themselves as middle-class. We must admire the way Wells managed to overcome poverty and physical illness. \\u201cFor two years,\\u201d writes Tomalin, \\u201cthe family lived on meager fare \\u2014 bread and cheese, half a herring for breakfast.\\u201d And Wells, as a boy, survived a broken tibia, then later after a rough game of rugby, according to a doctor\\u2019s diagnosis, \\u201ca crushed kidney and a bruised liver.\\u201d More than once, he found himself coughing up blood.\", \"Fortunately, his mother secured employment as the maid of Frances Bullock, wife of a wealthy landowner and the owner of Uppark, \\u201cone of the most luxurious and elegantly furnished great houses in the country.\\u201d Living at Uppark with Sarah in the servants\\u2019 quarters, young Wells found a library of great literature, he could read and convalesce when ill, and during these early years wrote and illustrated his first book, \\u201cThe Desert Daisy,\\u201d when he was 12 or 13 years old.\", \"Time and again in his youth, he was confronted with career options wrong for his multiple talents, originality, imagination and critical intelligence \\u2014 for example, as a chemist\\u2019s assistant, and a trial apprenticeship at Hyde\\u2019s Drapery Emporium that became \\u201cthe unhappiest and most hopeless period of his entire life.\\u201d Yet some early work like being a student-teacher served him well, giving him the chance to educate himself in the fields of anatomy, mathematics, chemistry, especially biology, geometry, and then win a scholarship to the Normal School of Science. There, his talent for debate and writing, his natural charm and sense of humor, blossomed.\", \"At the Normal School of Science, we see him \\u201calways ready to set off on fresh paths,\\u201d in Tomalin\\u2019s words. \\u201cTaking on too much was the way Wells lived his life.\\u201d He gave talks at the college Debating Society, one being \\u201cThe Past and Future of the Human Race,\\u201d which foreshadowed by a decade his vision of things to come in \\u201cThe Time Machine,\\u201d a work initially published in the first issue of New Review by his friend William Henley, best known for his poem \\u201cInvictus.\\u201d\", \"Tomalin, who has written biographies of Charles Dickens, Samuel Pepys and other writers, found that she could not simply deliver the young Wells and confesses that \\u201cI have found him too interesting to leave.\\u201d Thus, all of Wells\\u2019s life emerges here as she takes us carefully through three important, overlapping profiles of one of England\\u2019s enduring, most widely read and cited literary artists. One profile is Wells as a social activist determined, as he said, \\u201cto write, talk and preach revolution.\\u201d He was an atheist, a socialist and the author of scores of books where he frequently dreamed of a better social world; his political publications were as influential and popular as his groundbreaking science fiction tales, which he called \\u201cscientific romances.\\u201d We learn about his important though not entirely comfortable involvement with the visionary progressives in the Fabian Society. In his best-selling work \\u201cAnticipations,\\u201d he told a friend, his intention was \\u201cto undermine and destroy the monarch, monogamy and respectability \\u2014 and the British Empire, all under the guise of a speculation about motorcars and electrical heating.\\u201d It is no little achievement that his 1940 \\u201cThe Rights of Man\\u201d became \\u201cone of the sources for the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights\\u201d proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly.\", \"Wells did, in fact, destroy monogamy and respectability in his own life. Examining at length this unpleasant, sad dimension, Tomalin enables us to see that \\u201che was a bad husband and an unreliable lover,\\u201d with the person he hurt the most being his second wife, Jane, who \\u201cfound herself abandoned for ever longer periods as the years went by, while he carried on his love affairs in blazes of publicity.\\u201d\", \"So it is this biography\\u2019s last profile of Wells as a prolific, original storyteller that ensorcelled me as a young reader and, as a writer, cemented my respect for him. Though he was often sick, and self-educated, his early literary labors were prodigious. Before his success with \\u201cThe Time Machine,\\u201d he took work copying diagrams for slides sold to medical students, tutored students, devised quiz questions for cheap magazines and wrote two popular science textbooks, one of which he illustrated, yet to him they were hackwork. He edited a journal and weekly, churned out book reviews, tried his hand unsuccessfully at playwriting, sold lightweight pieces to The Pall Mall Gazette, which, to his surprise, earned him more money than he received from teaching. All this is but the iceberg\\u2019s tip of his voluminous literary outpourings.\", \"\\u201cThere was a period when he was turning out 7,000 words a day,\\u201d writes Tomalin. \\u201cHe kept working at what seems an impossible rate, producing stories so varied one might easily think they came from a team of writers.\\u201d Few writers will equal his worldwide impact on letters. With Jules Verne and the publisher Hugo Gernsback, he invented the genre of science fiction. A crater on the moon\\u2019s far side is named after him. Nominated four times for the Nobel Prize in Literature, Wells, the futurist, foresaw the coming of aircraft, tanks, the sexual revolution, the atomic bomb, and created the classic templates for every story that has been written about alien invasion (his inspiration for \\u201cThe War of the Worlds,\\u201d says Tomalin, was \\u201cTasmania, and the disaster the arrival of the Europeans had been for its people, who were annihilated\\u201d) and time travel (he was the first to imagine such travel made possible by a machine).\", \"Would that I could mention all the illuminating details in this biography, for example, why Wells praised Black Americans so highly, saying, \\u201cI took a mighty liking to these gentle, human, dark-skinned people,\\u201d and \\u201cWhatever America has to show in heroic living today, I doubt if she can show anything finer than the quality of the resolve, the steadfast efforts hundreds of black and colored men are making today to live blamelessly, honorably and patiently, getting by themselves what scraps of refinement, beauty and learning they may, keeping their hold on a civilization they are grudged and denied.\\u201d This book\\u2019s subtitle is exactly right, for Wells did change our world. And Tomalin\\u2019s account of his early years educates and entertains, despite the difficulty of delivering the large life and legacy of H. G. Wells in a single volume.\"]","href_hash":"b064a554495a11ec97056760ccdd4923"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b064a554495a11ec97056760ccdd4923"}},
