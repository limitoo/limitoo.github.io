Except this time it contained a little surprise: a GPS tracking device.\", \"It was early on Monday morning when the Bankheads' security camera captured a man driving up to the house again before making off with the cardboard box.\", \"Once Cody realized the box containing the GPS tracking device had been taken, he informed his father who passed the message on to the police.\", \"With the tracking information in hand, officers from Provo Police were able to make an arrest soon after with the suspect later transferred to Orem Police.\", \"Returning to Facebook, Justin shared a post featuring clips of the alleged thief stealing the package and later being arrested.\", \"\\\"NAILED IT!\\\" he wrote. \\\"This morning another package was stolen from our porch, but this time Cody had a tracker in the package and we caught the guy!! Cody just made $500!!! Hell yeah!\\\"\", \"Justin later told Fox 13 he hopes their story serves as a warning to any other would-be package thieves out there.\", \"\\\"Everyone has these frustrations of these guys running around in neighborhoods having a free-for-all,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"If you're going out there, you are going to get caught. People are smarting up.\\\"\", \"While the Bankheads have hopefully stopped their parcel thief in his tracks, others may not be so lucky over the busy Christmas giving season.\", \"Indeed, package thefts are an alarming common issue in the U.S., with a recent survey by Safewise revealing an estimated 210 million packages have vanished from porches across the country over the past 12 months.\", \"The Bankheads aren't the first family to get their own back though. One clan in Missouri managed to trick a thief into stealing a box which, unbeknownst to them, contained nothing but dirty diapers.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946595/front-door-packages-outside-it.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Stock image of a front door at Christmas.
