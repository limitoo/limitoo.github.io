Kelly.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-17T11:57:22.000Z","content":"[\"The Manhattan district attorney\\u2019s decision in February to review the convictions of two men for the assassination of Malcolm X coincided with the release of a six-part documentary on Netflix, \\u201cWho Killed Malcolm X?,\\u201d that made a strong case they were innocent.\", \"The two men are set to be exonerated Thursday, and Abdur-Rahman Muhammad, a historian who hosted the documentary, pointed to the series as the catalyst. He tweeted Wednesday that the exoneration was a \\u201chistoric milestone.\\u201d\", \"It was not the first time in recent years that a documentary film altered the public perception of a case and forced the authorities to re-examine their decisions.\", \"In 2015, a six-part HBO documentary called \\u201cThe Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst\\u201d started a chain of events that led to the conviction of Mr. Durst, a New York real estate scion, for the killing of Susan Berman in Los Angeles in 2000. In October he was sentenced to life without parole.\", \"The documentary delved into the deaths of not only Ms. Berman but also of Mr. Durst\\u2019s wife, Kathie McCormack Durst, who disappeared in 1982. Earlier this month, Mr. Durst was charged with his wife\\u2019s murder as well.\", \"Dick DeGuerin, Mr. Durst\\u2019s lead defense attorney, encouraged Mr. Durst not to cooperate with the filmmakers but he did anyway, handing over hours of interviews and access to troves of documents including telephone bills, credit card statements, and legal records.\", \"Hours before the final part of the documentary aired, Mr. Durst was arrested on a murder warrant for Ms. Berman\\u2019s killing. \\u201cIt\\u2019s abundantly clear we wouldn\\u2019t be where we are now if it wasn\\u2019t for \\u2018The Jinx,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. DeGuerin told The New York Times in 2017.\", \"The singer R. Kelly could spend the rest of his life in prison after being found guilty in September of running a decades-long scheme to recruit women and underage girls for sex. That conviction came two years after some of the women accusing him of abusing them as teenagers shared their stories in a 2019 Lifetime documentary series called \\u201cSurviving R. Kelly.\\u201d\", \"The allegations against Mr. Kelly had first been publicized in reporting by a Chicago music critic in the early 2000s, and Mr. Kelly had been acquitted of child pornography charges after that, in 2008.\", \"Still, the women telling their stories onscreen led to renewed interest in Mr. Kelly\\u2019s activities from law enforcement. After the documentary aired, the singer faced new criminal charges in Minnesota, Illinois, and New York, at the federal and state levels.\", \"Podcasts have also influenced legal cases. \\u201cIn the Dark,\\u201d a 2019 podcast by journalists at APM Reports, looked closely at how a white prosecutor in Mississippi, over the span of several decades, had tried Curtis Flowers, who is Black, six times for the 1996 killings of four people in a furniture store.\", \"The reporters raised doubts about the prosecutors\\u2019 forensic evidence. The show won a George Polk award, a prestigious journalism prize.\", \"After it was released, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the prosecutor in the cases had unconstitutionally kept Black people off the juries. And months after the Supreme Court\\u2019s ruling, the Supreme Court of Mississippi decided to throw out the case.\"]","href_hash":"7694562447e011ecadfadd901fb8618b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7694562447e011ecadfadd901fb8618b"}},
