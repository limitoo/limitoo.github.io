Tourism directly accounted for more than 12 percent of the country\\u2019s economy in 2019 and provided jobs to 630,000 people, she said.\", \"Last month, the Southeast Asian nation of about 16 million announced plans to let fully vaccinated foreign tourists begin entering the country at the end of November if they first quarantined in selected areas for five days.\", \"But citing the rapid pace of inoculations and a vaccination rate of 88 percent, Prime Minister Hun Sen accelerated that plan and said that fully vaccinated tourists could arrive without quarantine, effective on Monday.\", \"\\u201cThis is a big step towards reopening the entire country,\\u201d said Mr. Hun Sen, an authoritarian leader who came to power in 1984. \\u201cI hope our compatriots enjoy our reopening. It is widely due to the country having achieved such an outstanding rate of vaccination.\\u201d\", \"While the prime minister put the fully vaccinated rate at 88 percent based on a population of 16 million, The New York Times database puts the rate at 80 percent, based on a population of nearly 16.5 million. \", \"More than two million people also have received a third dose.\", \"About 90 percent of Cambodia\\u2019s vaccines came from China, including more than nine million doses of Sinovac and nearly four million doses of Sinopharm.\", \"Under the new rules, travelers arriving from abroad can skip quarantine if they are fully vaccinated, test negative before departure and test negative again on arrival. Travelers who are not vaccinated must still spend 14 days in quarantine.\", \"Ms. Sivlin said that tourist bookings were beginning to pick up and that airlines were working to increase the number of flights to Cambodia.\", \"Some flights are scheduled to the capital, Phnom Penh, but none for Siem Reap, the town near the ancient city of Angkor that is one of the most popular destinations in Southeast Asia.\", \"Like many of its neighbors, Cambodia reported relatively few virus cases in 2020 but faced a deadly surge this year. Still, its overall numbers have remained relatively low, with about 120,000 total cases and 2,900 deaths.\"]","href_hash":"7a6ebc1848e811ec87bdddb222900583"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7a6ebc1848e811ec87bdddb222900583"}},
