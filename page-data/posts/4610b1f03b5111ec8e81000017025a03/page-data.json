But only days earlier, he was urging the world\\u2019s largest oil producers to pump more of the fossil fuels that are warming the planet.\", \"The incongruity was on center stage both at the global climate summit currently taking place in Scotland, and in Rome this past weekend during a gathering of leaders from the 20 largest economies. The president\\u2019s comments highlighted the political and economic realities facing politicians as they grapple with climate change. And they underscored the complexity of moving away from the fossil fuels that have underpinned global economic activity since the Industrial Age.\", \"\\u201cOn the surface, it seems like an irony,\\u201d Mr. Biden said at a news conference Sunday. \\u201cBut the truth of the matter is \\u2014 you\\u2019ve all known; everyone knows \\u2014 that the idea we\\u2019re going to be able to move to renewable energy overnight,\\u201d he said, was \\u201cjust not rational.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden\\u2019s words have drawn fire from energy experts and climate activists, who say the world cannot afford to ramp up oil and natural gas production if it wants to avert catastrophic levels of warming. Environmental groups are intensely watching to see how the president intends to meet his ambitious goal of halving the nation\\u2019s emissions, compared to 2005 levels, by the end of this decade.\", \"A recent International Energy Agency report found that countries must immediately stop new oil, gas and coal development if they hope to keep the average global temperature from increasing 1.5 Celsius above preindustrial levels, the threshold beyond which scientists say the Earth faces irreversible damage. The planet has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius.\", \"\\u201cWe are in a climate crisis. There is no room for the left hand and the right hand to be doing different things,\\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, executive director at Greenpeace International. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not credible to say you\\u2019re fighting for 1.5 degrees while you\\u2019re calling for increased oil production.\\u201d\", \"With gasoline prices rising above $3.30 a gallon nationwide, Mr. Biden over the weekend urged major energy producing countries with spare capacity to boost production, part of a larger effort to pressure OPEC countries and Russia to increase the supply of oil. He was joined by Emmanuel Macron of France, whose country hosted the 2015 meeting in Paris where 200 countries agreed to collectively tackle global warming.\", \"At the conclusion Sunday of a Group of 20 summit that ended with lofty rhetoric on climate but fewer concrete actions than activists had hoped, Mr. Biden addressed the irony head on. The transition to lower-emission sources of energy would take years, and in the meantime, it was important to ensure that people can afford to drive their cars and heat their homes, he said at a news conference.\", \"\\u201cIt does, on the surface, seem inconsistent,\\u201d the president said, \\u201cbut it\\u2019s not at all inconsistent in that no one has anticipated that this year we\\u2019d be in a position \\u2014 or even next year \\u2014 that we\\u2019re not going to use any more oil or gas; that we\\u2019re not going to be engaged in any fossil fuels. We\\u2019re going to stop subsidizing those fossil fuels. We\\u2019re going to be making significant changes. And it just makes the argument that we should move more rapidly to renewable energy \\u2014 to wind and solar and other means of energy.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden\\u2019s climate and social spending plan pending in Congress does not eliminate government subsidies for fossil fuels, which are estimated to be about $20 billion annually.\", \"His comments came as the president and his aides are struggling to parry Republican attacks linking his economic agenda to rising inflation, including higher gasoline prices, which are helping to drive down his approval ratings.\", \"Mr. Biden has shown a high sensitivity to the politics of the pump. He repeatedly rebuffed efforts by Republican senators earlier this year to raise federal gasoline taxes \\u2014 a move economists widely say would discourage oil demand \\u2014 over concerns that they would place an undue burden on middle-class Americans and violate his pledge to increase taxes on people earning less than $400,000 a year.\", \"Middle class Americans \\u201chave to get to their work. They have to get in an automobile, turn on the key, get their kids to school,\\u201d Mr. Biden said at the news conference. \\u201cThe school buses have to run.\\u201d He said the idea \\u201cthat there\\u2019s an alternative to walk away from being able to get in your automobile is just not realistic; it\\u2019s not going to happen.\\u201d\", \"The president\\u2019s answers in some ways echoed the executives of several large oil and gas companies, who testified last week before a House panel investigating the role of their industry in disinformation aimed at slowing down a transition to wind, solar and other clean energy. As Democrats on the committee tried to extract promises from the executives that they would phase out oil and gas development, Republicans noted that Mr. Biden was asking the companies to increase production.\", \"\\u201cOil and gas will continue to be necessary for the foreseeable future,\\u201d Darren Woods, C.E.O. of Exxon Mobil, told the committee. \\u201cWe currently do not have the adequate alternative energy sources.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden\\u2019s legislative agenda seeks to speed the migration away from oil in several ways. The large spending bill pending in Congress includes $550 billion in climate initiatives, largely concentrated in tax credits to incentivize solar power, electric cars and other technologies meant to reduce emissions. A separate piece of legislation, a bipartisan infrastructure bill, includes a down payment on Mr. Biden\\u2019s goal of building out a national network of electric-vehicle charging stations.\", \"But those initiatives have not yet passed. And even if they do, they could take years to begin to bend American consumer preferences away from gasoline-powered vehicles, a lag that administration officials repeatedly cite in explaining his push for more oil production in the short term.\", \"\\u201cIf he were asking them to boost their production over five years, I\\u2019d quit,\\u201d John Kerry, Mr. Biden\\u2019s special presidential envoy for climate, told reporters Sunday. \\u201cBut he\\u2019s not. He\\u2019s asking them to boost production in this immediate moment.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Kerry maintained that as the world expands wind and solar energy and invests in new transmission networks to carry that renewable electricity to homes and businesses, it will \\u201cliberate\\u201d countries from dependence on fossil fuels.\", \"\\u201cBut you can\\u2019t just shut down everybody\\u2019s economy across the planet and say, \\u2018OK, we\\u2019re not going to use oil\\u2019 or whatever,\\u201d Mr. Kerry said.\", \"Some energy analysts agreed, saying that while the timing of Mr. Biden\\u2019s request for increased oil production may be awkward, doing so reflects economic reality. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a difference between the world we have today and the world we want in the future,\\u201d said Jason Bordoff of the Columbia Climate School at Columbia University.\", \"\\u201cIt makes perfect sense for the Biden administration to simultaneously seek to make sure there\\u2019s adequate and affordable energy for households today and at the same time take the most aggressive measures in U.S. history to spur vehicle electrification and move beyond oil in the future,\\u201d he said.\", \"In its road map detailing how to slash global carbon dioxide emissions by midcentury, the International Energy Agency urged ending sales of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035; phasing out by 2040 power plants that burn coal, oil and gas without capturing their emissions; and creating a global energy sector based largely in renewables by 2050.\", \"The I.E.A. also warned that emissions are still rising and that the world is still going in the wrong direction, failing to grasp the massive transformation of the global energy system required to keep the planet safe.\", \"The World Meteorological Organization reported last month that the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached a record level in 2020, despite an economic slowdown caused by the pandemic, and is rising again this year. Meanwhile, China is expanding coal production and imports in response to power shortages the past several months.\", \"Justin Guay, director of global strategy with the Sunrise Project, a nonprofit group that advocates for a global transition away from oil, gas and coal, said the United States and other nations need to immediately halt new fossil fuel production.\", \"\\u201cNet zero lives or dies on whether we move beyond fossil fuels,\\u201d said Mr. Guay, whose group is not affiliated with the Sunrise Movement activist group. \\u201cThat starts with an immediate halt to the expansion of coal, oil and gas. Not next year or next decade. Right now.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4610b1f03b5111ec8e81000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4610b1f03b5111ec8e81000017025a03"}},
