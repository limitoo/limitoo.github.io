Imposing vaccine passes and mandates splintered her \\\"team of five million\\\" and a protest at Parliament ended in a riot.\", \"The prime minister was \\\"trying to turn the page on a vile six months\\\" said Herald political editor Claire Trevett. \\\"We initially had to live with mandates and vaccine passes and gathering limits so we didn't have to live with Covid-19. There is little point in living with all of them together.\\\"\", \"Stuff political editor Luke Malpass said much of the government's job for the last two years was coming to an end and the future would be different.\", \"\\\"Politics won't be literally about 'going hard and going early'.

In aggregate, household costs were expected to increase 7 percent this year, or $15 billion, Stuff reported.\", \"During her speech in the Beehive theatrette Ardern used slides showing how cases were falling in Auckland and levelling off in other North Island regions. The South Island isn't there yet but the trends were strong enough overall for her to make the call.\", \"The sports sector celebrated the removal of outdoor gathering limits, the hospitality sector didn't think that doubling the limit to 200 in restaurants and bars went far enough because they still have to use social distancing, and vulnerable people voiced fears that they would be more at risk.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/233472/eight_col_BLUES_CROWD.jpg?1592027853\\\" alt=\\\"Blues fans celebrate\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nCrowds are on the way back at Super Rugby matches.  \\nPhoto: Photosport\\n</div>\", \"Political reaction was summed up by RNZ this way: \\\"National would have gone further in removing Covid-19 restrictions but backs the government.

We can manage that with simpler sets of rules rather than a confusing traffic lights system.\\\"\", \"The Green Party's Golriz Ghahraman, who has multiple sclerosis and is immunocompromised, said mandates and passes had been about inclusion.\", \"\\\"It meant we could leave the house, we could go to work, we could go to school, so it was about inclusion,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"And now we are in a position where we have to decide whether we want to go out into those spaces at quite a high risk, which feels exclusionary.\\\"\", \"Act leader David Seymour, who has been more forceful than National about removing restrictions, predicted the economy would be in recession in the first two quarters of the year and characterised the government's decisions as an attempt to save face.\", \"\\\"Our economy is heading for recession and the prime minister just keeps fiddling,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"What we needed was a sea change - it's time to move on and dump restrictions that don't make sense. Instead, the restrictions are being strung out in a political theatre of the absurd.\\\"\", \"Michael Baker, the most widely quoted epidemiologist throughout the pandemic, said the day before Ardern's announcement that winding back restrictions could cause a second Omicron wave.\", \"\\\"Cases are going up in some parts of the country, hospitalisations are at a record high, it's a bit early to risk adding more fuel to the fire,\\\" he said.\", \"The day after the announcement science commentator Siouxie Wiles told Nine to Noon she was immensely disappointed.\", \"\\\"There's a huge emphasis on 'it's safe to do things' but who is it safe for?\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Removing QR scanning and passports makes it less safe for some people.
