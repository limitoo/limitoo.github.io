On the day of the shooting, a teacher saw numerous drawings on Crumbley's desk, including one with a gun that appeared to be shooting a person. Crumbley's parents were alerted of the incidents but he remained in school after a meeting and, eventually, allegedly carried out the shooting.\", \"Crumbley has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder and several other charges related to the shooting.
