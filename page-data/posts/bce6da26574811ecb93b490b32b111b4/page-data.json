To gain traction, scour them with sandpaper; Pimienta uses scissors or a knife to make scratches all over the soles.\", \"Breaking in leather boots begins with getting the right fit. If a boot is too small back-to-front or too narrow in width, no amount of breaking-in can make them comfortable. Your toe should never press up against the boot\\u2019s front end. Also consider how the boot fits against the calf, too: There should be two fingers between the leather of the shoe and your leg. You may have to get boots with a wider calf size \\u2014 or, as Pimienta\\u2019s sister does, use wraps, Band-Aids or long socks to try to prevent blisters from forming around the calves. But if a boot is too big, your feet will be sliding around with every step, leading to friction and blisters.\", \"Once you find the right size, wear thick socks or multiple pairs to stretch the leather slightly. Pressure, heat and moisture will soften new leather. Walk around the house in your boots, then work while wearing them. For Pimienta, that can include trudging through the mud, galloping sidesaddle, practicing synchronized routines on horseback with her escaramuza team, which consists of eight women.\", \"If you don\\u2019t work at a ranch, go slow. Wear your new boots for only a few hours, and keep your old ones nearby as a backup; don\\u2019t wear new boots several days in a row. When off your feet, work the leather by bending the boot at the ankle and where the ball of the foot hits. Pimienta holds on to broken-in boots for as long as possible. \\u201cI use them until there\\u2019s a hole, or until at least I start feeling water getting into them,\\u201d Pimienta says. \\u201cOnce you have them to the mold of your foot, it\\u2019s so hard to let them go.\\u201d\", \"\"]","href_hash":"bce6da26574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bce6da26574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}},
