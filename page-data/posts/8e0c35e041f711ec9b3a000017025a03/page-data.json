She flew with the Blue Angels and worked to promote the United States Navy. But many of her other commercials were for personal products. In an ad for pantyhose, she struck a Mrs. Robinson-like pose. In a cigarette spot, she smoked. She also made a brief foray into directing commercials, but did not enjoy it.\", \"When she appeared on \\u201cThe Merv Griffin Show,\\u201d Mr. Griffin said that if all her commercials were strung together, they would run for 150 hours, or six days of continuous viewing. He noted that advertisers said she had \\u201cthe perfect face,\\u201d although he did not specify what that meant.\", \"When Mr. Griffin asked her if she felt pretty, she demurred. \\u201cPretty,\\u201d she said, \\u201ccomes from being healthy and feeling good about who you are and what you do.\\u201d\", \"Patricia Kara Cameron was born on Sept. 20, 1948, in Greeley, Colo., where her parents, Harold and Erna (Borgens) Cameron, operated a drive-in restaurant.\", \"She showed an interest in acting from an early age.
