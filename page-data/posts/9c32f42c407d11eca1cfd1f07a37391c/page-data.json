His favorite amenity: the basketball court.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-08T10:22:26.000Z","content":"[\"If you\\u2019re unhappy with your New York City apartment, it helps to have a relative who is a real estate agent.\", \"That\\u2019s what Tim Burns, 38, discovered. Earlier this year, Mr. Burns was living much too close to an overactive jackhammer. He liked his studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, but the construction noise \\u2014 a side effect of living in a neighborhood freshly colonized by high-rises \\u2014 was beginning to get to him. The ruckus started at 7 a.m. and didn\\u2019t break for lunch.\", \"One day last winter, his sister-in-law, Marlene Burns, an agent at Compass, called him. As Mr. Burns recalled, she said, \\u201c\\u2018Tim, I just saw this building. You\\u2019ve got to at least look at it.\\u2019 And whenever she tells me this stuff, I\\u2019m always like, \\u2018OK.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"He walked the two minutes to the Dime, a 23-story apartment building in Williamsburg, to meet her. Halfway through their visit, he said, \\u201cwe were making eye contact, like, \\u2018I need to move here.\\u2019\\u201d He did so in March.\", \"Mr. Burns\\u2019s sister-in-law was sure he would love the building because it had a basketball court. (Really, it\\u2019s a half court, with wide wings and a truncated length.) Mr. Burns is a skill trainer with Pro Hoops, a company that trains basketball players of all ages and backgrounds. But the company doesn\\u2019t have its own court yet, so for Mr. Burns, having a home court where he could train clients \\u2014 from athletic tweens to N.B.A. pros \\u2014 was a huge draw.\", \"The Dime occupies the old Dime Savings Bank building, which will eventually become a retail or commercial property. It abuts a gleaming new tower with 117 rental units as well as a basketball court, a gym, a sauna, a squadron of grills on the grassy fifth-floor terrace and office space for residents.\", \"Those amenities make life in a 400-square-foot studio easier, as does having office space a few floors away. The bright, white walls and wide windows maximize light in the $3,150-a-month apartment, making it feel more spacious. And during the warmer months, Mr. Burns cooked regularly on the building\\u2019s grills.\", \"\\u201cWhen you live in a studio, you don\\u2019t want to smoke it up,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo I can go out on the terrace and get all that cooking done, and my living space isn\\u2019t filled with smoke.\\u201d\", \"Count this as a rarely discussed renter\\u2019s luxury: never having to wake up to the smell of last night\\u2019s grilled steak.\", \"Occupation: Basketball trainer\", \"His favorite perk in the studio: \\u201cI have a walk-in closet, so I have a lot of storage space in here for shoes and clothes \\u2014 with basketball, and training, I always have sneakers to stack up.\\u201d\", \"The neighborhood\\u2019s best new pizza spot: \\u201cAce\\u2019s Pizza on Driggs is really great, and sort of under the radar. They just opened up, and they serve Detroit-style pizza.\\u201d\", \"Once he moved in, Mr. Burns arranged with the building management to hold a free training class once a week for residents, many of whom are young and fitness-focused, as he is.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve only seen a handful of families in the building,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a lot of people who are trying to be active, and people are always finding time to get in there and play a little bit of pickup, even if it\\u2019s just to shoot.\\u201d\", \"For many of the tenants he has met, the building\\u2019s fitness element was a big draw, so the court and gym double as social spaces. Mr. Burns often invites friends over for a pickup game, or dinner on the terrace, or both.\", \"He now knows when the court will be busy and which times are quietest. In those off-hours, he is able to train clients, taking them through baseline drills and advising them on their games, both physical and mental. He also offers personalized training sessions to the building\\u2019s residents.\", \"A longtime basketball player, Mr. Burns started training in 2007, when he moved to New York to work at Pro Hoops with his brother Ross Burns, who was already a trainer there and whom he shadowed professionally during his first months in the city.\", \"Mr. Burns enjoys the relationships fostered during training, which involves creating personalized plans for clients, running standard basketball drills and working on the mental aspect of the game. Training also doesn\\u2019t come with many of the interpersonal complications of running a team.\", \"\\u201cCoaches have a tremendous impact on players, but it\\u2019s not an easy job,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou have to cut people \\u2014 there\\u2019s always someone who\\u2019s going to be unhappy.\\u201d\", \"Training appealed to him, he continued, because \\u201cwhile you have to be hard on people and you have to hold them accountable, 100 percent of my relationship with clients is me helping them, developing them.\\u201d\", \"But even with his new home-court advantage, Mr. Burns still has to travel around the city to other courts. Training N.B.A. players often takes him into Manhattan to visit them at their practice courts, and if the court in his building is busy, he has to look elsewhere.\", \"\\u201cYou kind of just bounce around and make it work,\\u201d Mr. Burns said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the battle every year: having consistent gym access.\\u201d\", \"Recently, his brother Casey Burns helped found a charter school in Williamsburg, and he said he would rent the gym there on weekends. In a big city like New York, there\\u2019s always an open gym somewhere, and there\\u2019s always someone looking to play pickup.\"]","href_hash":"9c32f42c407d11eca1cfd1f07a37391c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9c32f42c407d11eca1cfd1f07a37391c"}},
