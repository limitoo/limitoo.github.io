It measured about two centimeters and was irregularly shaped and red-brown in color \\u2014 possible characteristics of a cancerous mole, signs that Ms. Popovici had learned to spot while volunteering at hospitals as a nursing assistant.\", \"Maybe he already knew? But if so, why was the mole still there? She concluded that Mr. Hamilton did not know.\", \"\\u201cI need to tell him,\\u201d Ms. Popovici, 22, told her parents at the Oct. 23 N.H.L. game between the Canucks and the Seattle Kraken at the Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle.\", \"Ms. Popovici typed a message on her phone and waited for the game to end. After waving several times, she finally drew Mr. Hamilton\\u2019s attention, and placed her phone against the plexiglass.\", \"\\u201cThe mole on the back of your neck is possibly cancerous. Please go see a doctor!\\u201d the message read, with the words \\u201cmole,\\u201d \\u201ccancer\\u201d and \\u201cdoctor\\u201d colored bright red.\", \"Mr. Hamilton said he looked at the message, rubbed the back of his neck and kept walking, thinking, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s weird.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Popovici said she regretted the message and thought at the time, \\u201cMaybe that was inappropriate of me to bring up.\\u201d\", \"After the game, Mr. Hamilton went home and asked his partner if she could spot the mole. She could. He asked the team doctor if it was worrisome. It was. Then after he had it removed, he waited for the biopsy results to see if the fan sitting behind the team\\u2019s bench had been right.\", \"Indeed, Ms. Popovici was correct, and she had just saved his life.\", \"\\u201cShe took me out of a slow fire,\\u201d Mr. Hamilton said at a news conference on Saturday, his voice quavering at times. \\u201cAnd the words out of the doctor\\u2019s mouth were if I ignored that for four to five years, I wouldn\\u2019t be here.\\u201d\", \"Specifically, doctors later told him, it was type-2 malignant melanoma, a type of skin cancer that, because it was detected early, could be easily removed and treated.\", \"\\u201cWith melanoma, just like many other cancers, the success of the treatment or the cure is often dependent on the stage of disease \\u2014 and the sooner you find something, the better it is,\\u201d said Dr. Ashwani Rajput, the director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.\", \"Mr. Hamilton recalled the doctor telling him, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to diagnose you with cancer and I\\u2019m going to cure you of cancer in the same phone call.\\u201d\", \"Once he knew he was fine, Mr. Hamilton asked the Canucks franchise to help him find the woman he described as \\u201ca hero.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Hamilton wrote a letter that was posted on the team\\u2019s Twitter account on Saturday that said: \\u201cTo this woman I am trying to find, you changed my life, and now I want to find you to say THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH! Problem is, I don\\u2019t know who you are or where you are from.\\u201d\", \"It took less than three hours to find Ms. Popovici, who had been sleeping at her home in Tacoma, Wash., that afternoon after working overnight as a crisis intervention specialist at a suicide prevention hotline.\", \"She woke up to texts and missed calls from her mother, Yukyung Nelson. \\u201cI think she was just shocked,\\u201d Ms. Nelson said.\", \"Ms. Popovici, who had already planned to attend the game on Saturday between the Canucks and Kraken in Seattle, was invited by both teams to meet Mr. Hamilton.\", \"He had just finished a news conference about what had happened. Referring to Ms. Popovici, he told reporters, \\u201cMy mom wants her to know that she loves her.\\u201d\", \"Later that afternoon, he repeated the message to Ms. Popovici in person.\", \"\\u201cIt was the sweetest thing when you were talking about your mom,\\u201d she told him as they met properly for the first time.\", \"At the game, both teams presented Ms. Popovici a combined $10,000 scholarship to use for medical school expenses.\", \"\\u201cSome people are saying this is not even going to be a drop in the bucket, but trust me, it feels like everything,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019m really just so grateful.\\u201d\", \"She watched the game from the same seat where she had spotted the mole. Everything, she thought, had gone right that day: A future medical student had been sitting close enough to a team bench where an assistant equipment manager was, thankfully, not wearing a jacket large enough to cover the cancerous mole on his neck.\", \"\\u201cThis entire experience has been so rare,\\u201d Ms. Popovici said. \\u201cAnd I will just cherish it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a5e8a8726c1a11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a5e8a8726c1a11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
