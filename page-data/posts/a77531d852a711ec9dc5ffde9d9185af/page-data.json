Now, Bennani’s at work on a documentary about living in limbo.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-01T13:08:12.000Z","content":"[\"IN MARCH 2020, when Covid-19 was ripping through New York and the city locked down, Meriem Bennani felt an impulse to make a video. An animator and artist whose work sits at the intersection of homemade YouTube reality shows, hand-drawn cartoons and documentary film, Bennani was used to staying inside, funneling the world through her computer. But the first week of quarantine made her restless, and she wanted to create something immediate and raw that captured the way she was feeling.\", \"She and the filmmaker Orian Barki, who were spending lockdown together between their Brooklyn apartments, conceived a series of short Instagram videos about the changes they were witnessing. Barki would jot down her observations and feelings each day \\u2014 how moved she was by the viral videos of Italians playing music on their balconies, or how disturbing it was to see medical gloves splayed on the pavement \\u2014 and then she and Bennani would use these details to script a short story about what they were experiencing. They roamed their neighborhoods, filming street scenes with their iPhones. Bennani, who often creates animal narrators for her videos, found a file of 3-D animal models she had bought for a different project, and she and Barki chose two lizards with glossy copper-and-green skin and weirdly soulful black eyes for their avatars. Eventually, there would be a supporting cast voiced by various friends: a hummingbird, a cat, a cheetah, a mouse and a raccoon.\", \"In the 86-second video they posted to Bennani\\u2019s Instagram on March 17, the two lizards are on a Brooklyn rooftop, staring out at the cityscape. Bennani\\u2019s lizard confesses that she likes being stuck at home \\u2014 no social obligations, time to read and listen to music. Bennani is Moroccan and grew up speaking French and Moroccan Arabic, and her voice is girlish and urbane, with a gentle French accent. Barki\\u2019s lizard, who is sensuously low-voiced, with an Israeli accent, teases her friend: \\u201cThat\\u2019s such a quarantine Week 1 thing to say.\\u201d The spare dialogue quickly establishes the characters as worldly New Yorkers-from-elsewhere who regard their adopted city with side-eyed affection. The city seems to glitter under their gaze.\", \"When a friend texted the video to me, I thought it perfectly captured the mood of aimlessness and confusion, punctured by occasional magic, that defined New York in those early days of the pandemic. There\\u2019s a moment, as the lizards look out over their city, when a camel on a neighboring rooftop spontaneously erupts on his trumpet into the jazz standard \\u201cIt Never Entered My Mind.\\u201d A sheep on another rooftop joins in on bass, while a dog on the pavement down below plays keyboard. Bennani and Barki captured the sense that isolation didn\\u2019t suit city people \\u2014 that their pent-up energy and longing were spilling into the streets.\", \"Bennani and Barki made seven more two- to five-minute videos over the course of the next four months \\u2014 eventually titling the series \\u201c2 Lizards\\u201d \\u2014 that chart the course of the pandemic like the stages of grief. The surprising pleasures of the first weeks morph into anxiety verging on paranoia, which settles into languor as life indoors becomes repetitive and dreamlike, and eventually, after more than 100,000 people have died in the U.S. and the country has erupted into protests after the murder of George Floyd, heats up into anger.\", \"The lizards walk through an empty Times Square one day (a shot of a paper coffee cup with a lipstick mark, on which an animated butterfly is perched, is a metonym for the sudden cessation of street life and the return of nature) and comment wryly on the absurd decadence of the billboards blaring at a crowd of two. They lounge on a bed and watch vaguely sexy YouTube videos, Zoom birthday gatherings and newscasts of a pleading Dr. Fauci (depicted as a friendly snake). Barki\\u2019s character visits a cheetah friend on her stoop, tentatively placing an offering of a bag of grapes between them, and then they wait, tense, as a family of unmasked rabbits walks by. There are flashbacks to scenes of nights out with friends, a small gesture like the causal dipping of a finger into a shared dish of soy sauce becoming retroactively tinged with a terrible nostalgia. Eventually, the lizards go out and protest. The videos garnered a loyal following \\u2014 the first one has nearly 200,000 views on Instagram \\u2014 and were eventually acquired by the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.\", \"When we meet, one windy day in September, Bennani tells me that she uses animated animals in her work as a way of smuggling complicated messages in innocuous-seeming vessels. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a magic to it that I can\\u2019t escape,\\u201d she says. Bennani has curly black hair and an affable, definite manner. She is dressed in jeans and a jean jacket and sturdy black boots, and seems, like her lizard, to be someone who enjoys roaming the city. We are walking by the river in Battery Park City, and Bennani points out a sculpture by Louise Bourgeois that looks like a pair of giant metal breasts lounging on the grass, baring themselves to New Jersey across the river.\", \"Animation is one of her primary tools because it\\u2019s a zone of total fantasy: \\u201cIt stretches, it bounces, so everything is this pure storytelling material,\\u201d she explains. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what everyone and everything is made of. That\\u2019s the guiding principle. And storytelling is my guiding principle.\\u201d She attributes the success of \\u201c2 Lizards,\\u201d in part, to its modesty. \\u201cI think that we weren\\u2019t trying to find the truth, or reflecting in this superconstructed way. We were really like, \\u2018This is what we\\u2019re feeling, what it feels like right now.\\u2019\\u201d (Or as Barki puts it when I speak to her over the phone, \\u201cWe did it out of love.\\u201d) \\u201cThere is an aspect of the lizards, to me, that it\\u2019s not even good in an art context way,\\u201d Bennani tells me. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a sweetness to it. Everyone was feeling soft. And now it takes me back to that vulnerability.\\u201d\", \"Though Bennani and Barki released the \\u201c2 Lizards\\u201d project in a more populist way than is usual for a work of contemporary art \\u2014 on social media, at a time when most museums in the world were closed because of pandemic restrictions \\u2014 it has much in common with the longer video works that Bennani has become known for and has shown in sculptural installations at institutions like the Whitney and MoMA PS1: an inquisitive, antic humor that can encompass gimlet-eyed political observations; an insistent interest in showing the world through the eyes of those who are usually decentered (queer people, Arab people, women); an uncanny ability to locate the sublime in the raw footage of the internet. She is engaged in an ongoing project of world building, while managing to distill the visual complexities of our culture.\", \"Bennani\\u2019s work combines the frenetic surrealism of a Ryan Trecartin video, the argot of memes, Hollywood special effects and hand-held smartphone cinematography. Even as she poses a complicated question \\u2014 how do we locate reality in an increasingly surreal and dystopian world? \\u2014 she\\u2019s just doing what comes naturally to her, guided by pleasure and joy. As a child, \\u201cI got to spend a lot of time in my room doing my thing,\\u201d Bennani says. \\u201cI feel like my life hasn\\u2019t changed since childhood.\\u201d\", \"BENNANI, WHO IS 33, was born in the coastal city of Rabat, Morocco\\u2019s capital, the middle of three sisters. The family was close, but she always relished time alone drawing, messing around on the computer and entering into fantasy worlds. Her father, an architect, and mother, a pharmacist who often appears in Bennani\\u2019s videos playing a version of herself, were encouraging. She grew up \\u201cobsessed with the Cartoon Network,\\u201d and watched it well beyond the point when her friends lost interest. Bennani attended an elite French school, a legacy of Morocco\\u2019s colonial past, which she describes as a factory \\u201cof good colonized people who will perpetuate soft power.\\u201d She studied French instead of Moroccan history, and internalized a conviction that the French language was superior to Arabic. \\u201cYou start to have a very unhealthy relationship to your own culture and feel like you don\\u2019t recognize yourself,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI\\u2019ve done so much work to try to emancipate myself from that.\\u201d\", \"After high school, she studied art at the \\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\\u00e9rieure des Arts D\\u00e9coratifs in Paris and Cooper Union in New York and, in 2019, returned to her old French school to make a documentary, \\u201cMission Teens,\\u201d about the way that a postcolonial education shapes, and often warps, some Moroccan students. Bennani, as interviewer, casts herself in the role of a miniature donkey holding a camera, and we occasionally glimpse her as she observes the teenagers studying the history of colonialism in class, or a group of cool girls gossiping and dancing suggestively. One boy she interviews delivers a jingoistic monologue about \\u201creal Moroccans,\\u201d as he shows her his closet full of designer clothing and orders the Indonesian women who work in his house to bring him lunch. As he comments unselfconsciously on what he considers to be the distasteful habits of the underclass, we see Bennani\\u2019s donkey avatar reflected in his sunglasses, allowing us to see her seeing him, to judge as we might. But Bennani isn\\u2019t interested in condemnation or fun at his expense. Instead, she\\u2019s more attuned to the jumble of forces \\u2014 historical, familial, cultural \\u2014 that form an identity, and the bleak hilarity that can ensue as a result.\", \"Her videos are filled with special effects, which are emphatically lo-fi: \\u201cI\\u2019m really interested in bringing special effects in footage that is not shot really high production because, to me, it\\u2019s the same trick as some horror movies that look like you could have shot them on an iPhone. When the horror happens, it looks so real that it\\u2019s actually terrifying,\\u201d she says. She\\u2019s trying to achieve the same emotional immediacy, with little jolts of fantasy that make the real world feel heightened and destabilized.\", \"In her videos, there are animated gadgets (toasters, security cameras) that dance and sing, animal narrators and fictionalized dream world scenarios, all of which share a deliberate, unpolished aesthetic that recalls early aughts clip art. In this way, she exists in a lineage of low-budget, high-concept narrative video artists that includes Lynn Hershman Leeson, Joan Jonas and Pipilotti Rist. And yet the populism inherent in her work separates her from many of her forebears. Even though it\\u2019s full of surreal animations, Bennani has increasingly come to categorize her work as a type of documentary. She likes to put real people \\u2014 relatives, friends and larger-than-life characters she finds on YouTube and Instagram \\u2014 in fictional scenarios. \\u201cIt kind of makes them more emotionally accessible than a very straight-up dry documentary approach that presents itself as sincere, as not artificial, but actually is a complete construct,\\u201d she says.\", \"As \\u201cMission Teens\\u201d unfolds, Bennani uses animation to soften, complicate and amuse. At one point in the film, as she drives too fast in a car down a boulevard with a few of the teenagers, her camera pans the streetscape, and the gaudy houses of Rabat\\u2019s elite begin to sing of their complex inner lives: \\u201cI was bought by an ambassador / Got me up a golden door / Still I feel alone / Still I feel alone.\\u201d The melody was written by a Moroccan singer and influencer called Lil Patty, whom Bennani encountered on Instagram. The work is at once absurd and touching: tweaking the preening self-satisfaction of the ultrawealthy, while at the same time painting the city with the giddy, dramatic affect of the teenagers she is studying. When Bennani showed the video at the 2019 Whitney Biennial, she was pleased to hear that one of the museum guards was constantly singing the mansions\\u2019 song. He couldn\\u2019t get it out of his head.\", \"ON A GIVEN day, Bennani might spend hours on YouTube. Her curated list of music videos from around the world that lives on her website is an education in global pleasure-seeking, bodily variety and sheer weirdness, with examples of everything from Iraqi heavy metal to Congolese rumba. She watches everything: wrestling troupes, highly produced reality shows, home video footage and viral memes, much of it from North Africa. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the best way to stay in touch with what\\u2019s happening in Morocco because I feel like even if I watch Moroccan TV, I wouldn\\u2019t get that,\\u201d says Bennani, who moved to New York in 2009. \\u201cThis is pure reality. It\\u2019s made by the people who are in it, and so I\\u2019m learning so much about what people care about, what they listen to; what are the subjects, the modes of expression?\\u201d Often, something odd catches her eye \\u2014 something that would perhaps be beneath notice for anyone else but that instantly strikes her as precious. Recently, a video of two kids riding on a motorbike mesmerized her: There was something about the way they looked, like adult impersonators, that amused her and gave her ideas about all the ways bodies can be shape-shifting and unpredictable.\", \"What she\\u2019s looking for in this thicket of references is a new language, something to challenge the conventional rhythms of filmmaking \\u2014 quick cuts, a certain slickness \\u2014 that she absorbed from school and American TV. \\u201cThere is such a language to how you make a reality TV show,\\u201d Bennani says, \\u201cso if I\\u2019m inspired by that, I\\u2019m bringing in a language that is a product of a culture that is not the one of the people I\\u2019m filming. But when I watch Moroccan YouTube, I see what a true reality TV show would be, and what the pace would be if it were edited from a Moroccan way of structuring your thoughts.\\u201d She gives me an example of the different pacing possibilities she\\u2019s learned. \\u201cThere are these videos that people make, and before making them there\\u2019s always a five-minute intro of greetings. You would never have that in America. They\\u2019re not patient,\\u201d she says. \\u201cBut here, they all start with five minutes of just being polite.\\u201d\", \"Since 2016, Bennani has been engaged in what she calls a speculative documentary \\u2014 a series of videos about a fictitious island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean she calls the Caps. The idea began to suggest itself when the Trump administration was cracking down on migrants. Bennani was on a research jag, obsessively learning about teleportation. (Despite her playfulness, she\\u2019s unfailingly rigorous, and spends several minutes explaining recent experiments with photons in the Canary Islands and elsewhere that prove teleportation is possible.) She started to imagine a future in which teleportation has replaced air travel, and becomes the primary means by which people migrate. \\u201cAmericans would freak out,\\u201d she says.\", \"So she conceived of an updated version of Immigration and Customs Enforcement that had the technology to intercept teleportations, and transport people to a holding place on the Caps. The disrupted teleportations result in physiological glitches, including pixelated bodies and a ghoulishly hilarious deformation Bennani calls \\u201cplastic face syndrome,\\u201d whereby skin is covered in a layer of plastic. (\\u201cIn the Caps, bodies are a completely different story,\\u201d she explains. That they are constantly changing and in transition is \\u201can extension of queerness.\\u201d) The story of this universe is narrated in the first video in the \\u201cLife on the Caps\\u201d series, \\u201cParty on the Caps\\u201d (2018-19), by a buoyant crocodile who gives a guided tour of the animated megalopolis. The crocodile is voiced by Crotchet Fiona, a rapper from Barcelona whom Barki met on Instagram and who is originally from Equatorial Guinea and has a chipper, Spanish-inflected accent. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to place,\\u201d Bennani says, which is why she likes it.\", \"The Caps, even though it\\u2019s filled with the injured bodies of people whose lives have been violently arrested, is a lively, teeming place. People are stuck there for generations, so they start to build things: neighborhoods, cities, their own internet, their own brands. Bennani has filmed each of the three installments of \\u201cLife on the Caps\\u201d in Morocco, including one this year that used footage shot by her subjects, and the second chapter, which will be exhibited at the Renaissance Society in Chicago in February, 2022, and Nottingham Contemporary in England in May. The project has become a device, she says, through which she can talk about the country of her birth, to examine the state of being in diaspora, of statelessness. It\\u2019s a condition too easily regarded as tragic, or anomalous. But for Bennani, it\\u2019s not necessarily either. When you\\u2019re in limbo, she suggests, you don\\u2019t necessarily want to return or to assimilate. Maybe the Caps, Bennani says, \\u201cis a blueprint for a way of living.\\u201d\", \"It would be too simplistic to call Bennani a utopian artist: Perhaps it\\u2019s more accurate to say that she is a believer in the idea that the world, though fallen, still has a lot of what we need in it. It\\u2019s this conviction that makes her such a skilled chronicler of this uncertain and destructive pandemic moment. Watching \\u201c2 Lizards\\u201d a year and a half after it debuted, I\\u2019m struck by how much it has to tell us, and how pithily and lightly it does so. It feels definitive \\u2014 perhaps the canonical artwork about a very bad year. The dialogue is poetically tight and laced with funny social observation that is more authentic and honest about what happened than most news reports \\u2014 as in the sequence in Episode 7 when a reporter (a mouse) marvels at how resistant city officials were to imposing a curfew in the early months of the virus, and then, soon after the protests started, suddenly declared one. The lizards, with their Gumbyesque bodies, saunter through the real New York City streets: its oily puddles, decrepit overpasses, orange sunsets over clusters of rooftops, blaring bodega signs \\u2014 avatars not only for Bennani and Barki but for all New Yorkers who were seeing the city anew, in its glory and ugliness, confronting the inequities that bolstered daily life. The work has something devastating to say. But at the same time, it has the appeal of a cartoon.\", \"The lizards address something childish in us, and suggest that there are simple means available to regenerate the world. Bennani herself reiterates this point the last time I talk with her. She is speaking to me from a Parisian cafe on her way to Morocco to shoot the next installment of \\u201cLife on the Caps\\u201d and talks about how much she loves continuing to map and give detail to this fictional world. It\\u2019s \\u201ca language being built in real time.\\u201d In examining the horrifying aspects of a contemporary global society, she\\u2019s managed to create for herself a boundless reality. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an exciting place,\\u201d she says, \\u201cbecause it feels like everything is very possible there.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a77531d852a711ec9dc5ffde9d9185af"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a77531d852a711ec9dc5ffde9d9185af"}},
