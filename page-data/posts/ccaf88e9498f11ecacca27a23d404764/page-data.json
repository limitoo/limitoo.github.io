He inspires awe from his teammates through his impeccable conduct and exceptional play.\", \"In his way is the antiquated notion that the captaincy is no job for a fast bowler. It falls back on the stereotypical portrayal of the fast bowler of old \\u2014 all meat and muscle and fury, without the required subtlety or grace to lead a cricket team through five days of a Test match.\", \"It's an idea that isn't relevant to modern cricketers, and certainly one that doesn't apply to Cummins. He also can field inside the ring, so a tight proximity for barking instruction is no issue.\", \"Perhaps the only negative is the pressure that puts on Cummins to play all five Tests, lest Cricket Australia be left searching for another captain to fill the gap. Rotation of fast bowlers had been on the cards this summer already, but this move would likely mean Cummins would have to back up for the full series.\", \"But that aside, it seems a cut and dried case, and in truth it would be quite a surprise to see anyone other than Cummins wearing the green blazer in Brisbane.\", \"There will be speculative cases made for Steve Smith, but he looks much more likely to make a return to leadership either as an informal deputy or official vice-captain under Cummins.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/2e7e4156a271a527651b5c6f40578416\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> As Tim Paine's vice-captain and one of Australia's best cricketers, Pat Cummins would seem the obvious successor.(AP: Tertius Pickard)</div>\", \"The wicketkeeping question is more interesting.\", \"Cricket Australia has said Paine is available for selection, and considering the public support he has received from the Australian Cricketers Association among others in the wake of the news breaking, he must be considered the most likely to be Australia's keeper in Brisbane.\", \"But there are doubts. Firstly around his fitness, as it made sense to rush him back from neck surgery for the first Test when he was captain, but that perhaps looks a little more risky now.\", \"Fundamentally, the question facing Cricket Australia can be boiled down to this \\u2014 without the captaincy to fall back on, is Tim Paine the best wicketkeeper/batsman in the country?\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/78b4c17091030a4ae4290b8896d2beef\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Alex Carey has certainly proved he's willing to put his body on the line for Australia.(AP: Aijaz Rahi)</div>\", \"Alex Carey has been waiting in the wings for several years now, and would be considered the first cab off the rank should the selectors look elsewhere. His wicketkeeping is very good, and he has proven to be an excellent bat both for South Australia, the Adelaide Strikers and Australia in limited overs cricket.\", \"But Australian cricket history is littered with keepers who just didn't quite time their runs right. Carey hasn't exactly had a scorching start to the Sheffield Shield season, and is not demanding selection as strongly as he has done in years gone by.\", \"He is, however, named in the Australia A squad for the build-up to the Ashes. As is another keeper, Josh Inglis.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/73def6d1d6132ff1b5b188dee5756fb1\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Josh Inglis was in Australia's Twenty20 World Cup squad but did not play a game.(Getty: Will Russell)</div>\", \"Inglis could be considered the future. At 26 years old, he's the youngest of the genuine candidates and if selected now could be a long-term option for the national team.\", \"He made three first-class centuries last season, but hasn't had a great look at red ball cricket thus far this summer as he was part of Australia's victorious T20 World Cup squad. Still, Inglis comes highly regarded and, along with Carey, is considered one of the most likely successors to Paine.\", \"Neither are the most in-form keeper-bat in the country though. That honour belongs to Queensland's Jimmy Peirson.\", \"If Peirson isn't the best pure wicketkeeper in the country, you'd have to be splitting hairs to find someone better. And a breakthrough with the bat means he now boasts a package at least on par with his other Test competitors.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5c8e1e4f1a7433d6a462a9fe0d4aef0d\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Jimmy Peirson (right) would feel right at home with the first Test at the Gabba and plenty of Queenslanders in the squad.(Getty: Albert Perez)</div>\", \"He has made two Shield tons already this season and is batting at an average at 53. Though he would be a rookie in the side, Peirson is a Shield-winning captain and would bring a natural leadership and maturity.\", \"Plus the advantage of a potential debut at his home ground means he's less likely to be overawed by what will be a significant occasion.\", \"But even though Peirson's case is compelling, his omission from the Australia A squad means a Paine replacement is most likely to come from Carey or Inglis.\", \"Does Cricket Australia reward the patient heir to the throne? Does it set out a plan for its next five to eight years? Does it reward the hot hand and most recent form? Or does it stick by the embattled incumbent, come hell or high water?\", \"Unlike the captaincy, it's not an easy call.\"]","href_hash":"ccaf88e9498f11ecacca27a23d404764"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ccaf88e9498f11ecacca27a23d404764"}},
