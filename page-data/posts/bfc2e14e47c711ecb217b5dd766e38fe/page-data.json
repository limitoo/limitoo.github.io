The panel will formalize its recommendation at a meeting next month.\", \"The company\\u2019s interim research chief, Dr. Priya Singhal, said Biogen was \\u201cdisappointed\\u201d with the panel\\u2019s vote. Biogen said in a statement it would continue to work with European Union regulators \\u201cas it considers next steps\\u201d to try to get the drug approved in Europe.\", \"In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration approved the drug despite conflicting clinical trial results and the objections of its own independent advisers and many Alzheimer\\u2019s experts, who believed there was not enough evidence to show that Aduhelm is effective.\", \"In one study that yielded a positive result, a high dose of the drug only modestly slowed decline. Typically mild but potentially serious side effects like brain swelling or bleeding occurred in 40 percent of clinical trial participants.\", \"Biogen introduced the drug with a $56,000 annual price tag, on average, fueling expectations that it would strain government budgets within a few years. But the drug has had a stunningly slow start in its first few months of commercial availability. The company reported that the drug brought in just $1.9 million in revenue from the time it became available in the United States in June to the end of September.\", \"In the United States, the federal agency that administers Medicare is reviewing whether to standardize coverage of the drug nationwide, a step that could restrict which patients receive it. A draft decision is expected in January, with a final decision by April.\", \"The company announced on Monday that its research chief who had championed the internal effort to develop Aduhelm, Al Sandrock, would retire from the company at the end of the year.\"]","href_hash":"bfc2e14e47c711ecb217b5dd766e38fe"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bfc2e14e47c711ecb217b5dd766e38fe"}},
