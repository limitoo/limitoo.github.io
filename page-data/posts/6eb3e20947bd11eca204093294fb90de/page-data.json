Now, a new docuseries aims to examine the legacy of one of the aughts\\u2019 most sought-after brands.\", \"\\u201cThe Curse of Von Dutch: A Brand to Die For,\\u201d out Nov. 18 on Hulu, explores a complicated corporate origin story filled with sabotage and greed as various parties vied for control of the brand.\", \"Andrew Renzi, the director, was drawn to the notion that Von Dutch, best known for its logo-emblazoned trucker hats, was cursed from the get-go.\", \"\\u201cEverybody who had touched it, it touched them in a pretty negative way,\\u201d he said in a phone interview.\", \"Throughout the three-part series, Mr. Renzi excavates Von Dutch\\u2019s history, illustrating how it emerged from obscurity to become a fixture of Y2K fashion, worn by the likes of Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie and Jay-Z, and a highly disputed business.\", \"At the crux of the story is the question: What does it mean to build a brand on another person\\u2019s likeness? After all, Mr. Renzi said, Von Dutch \\u201cwas basically just a re-appropriation of Kenny Howard\\u2019s artwork.\\u201d\", \"Kenneth Robert Howard was a mechanic and car detailer turned midcentury artist who made work under the name Von Dutch. He began adorning hot rods in the 1950s with pin stripes, flames and flying eyeballs, all of which became hallmarks of a subcultural movement known as Kustom Kulture. (Recent assessments of his work have centered on his racist and antisemitic statements.)\", \"After Mr. Howard\\u2019s death in 1992, several people sought to capitalize on his name and influence.\", \"\\u201cIt was basically this grab by a lot of people that claim that they came up with the idea or went through the proper steps to own something that you never really should be able to own in the first place,\\u201d Mr. Renzi said.\", \"Ed Boswell, an art collector in Los Angeles, is often cited as the founder of Von Dutch and appears in the documentary to stake his claim to its success. (Mr. Boswell declined to be interviewed for this article.) But it wasn\\u2019t until 1996, when Mr. Howard\\u2019s daughters sold the rights to the Von Dutch name to Michael Cassel, a former drug dealer who pivoted to clothing design after serving four years in prison, that Von Dutch became the clothing company people know today.\", \"Mr. Cassel and Robert Vaughn, his mentee, took Mr. Howard\\u2019s artistic signature and made it the logo for Von Dutch Originals, an apparel line that would turn working-class signifiers into markers of cool.\", \"Emma McClendon, a fashion historian and the author of \\u201cPower Mode,\\u201d noted the tension between the brand\\u2019s trendiness and its roots. \\u201cThere\\u2019s implicit power dynamics in the appropriation of garments like this because you can pick and choose what garments you\\u2019re wearing, but leave behind the labor and legacy of people who originally wore these garments in the context that they wore them in,\\u201d she said in a phone interview.\", \"Booth Moore, the West Coast executive editor of Women\\u2019s Wear Daily, noted the irony of the hat appearing on Ms. Hilton and Ms. Richie as they performed manual labor on their reality show \\u201cThe Simple Life.\\u201d But, she said, \\u201cmost of the people who were wearing it at that time had absolutely no idea what the brand was about.\\u201d\", \"Tonny Sorensen, an investor and taekwondo champion, took over as the C.E.O. of Von Dutch in 2000, at a point when the company was seeking funding. Mr. Sorensen hired the French fashion designer Christian Audigier to help commercialize Von Dutch and extend its reach with famous clientele. Under his direction, Mr. Cassel and Mr. Vaughn believed the brand was \\u201cselling out.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe probably created influencer culture back in the day,\\u201d Mr. Sorensen said in a phone interview. \\u201cWe were the first ones who worked symbiotically with celebrities.\\u201d Mr. Audigier ended up leaving Von Dutch to join the tattoo art-inspired line Ed Hardy in 2004, by which point the trucker hats ($42-$125) were helping the company bring in tens of millions of dollars in revenue.\", \"Tracey Mills, a fashion entrepreneur, helped steer the company\\u2019s celebrity marketing efforts. \\u201cI was trying to bring in the biggest stars I knew and put it in the biggest videos, putting it on Ashton Kutcher when he was doing \\u2018Punk\\u2019d,\\u2019 which was the biggest show,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut I think over time once the culture starts to see big artists in it, then everybody wants it.\\u201d\", \"That heyday, however, lasted only a few years; in 2009, Mr. Sorensen sold Von Dutch to Groupe Royer, a French footwear company.\", \"\\u201cHe just was looking for any opportunistic buyer,\\u201d said Ed Goldman, the acting general manager of Von Dutch North America. While production never ceased, and the company never went bankrupt, its appeal waned. \\u201cIt just became this cult of cool,\\u201d Ms. Moore said. \\u201cUntil it wasn\\u2019t.\\u201d\", \"In 2019, Mr. Goldman was enlisted to help revive the Von Dutch brand and figure out how to market it to a new generation of shoppers. \\u201cThe brand had a very strong connection within the hip-hop community, which was where the light was shining still during the kind of downfall era,\\u201d Mr. Goldman said. Over the last couple years, Megan Thee Stallion and Saweetie have been spotted in Von Dutch, and last month, the brand released a streetwear collection with Young Thug.\", \"The company also brought back some of the brand\\u2019s most iconic pieces and logos. The classic trucker hat is currently Von Dutch\\u2019s top-selling item, according to the company; its bowling bags are a close second. After Travis Scott wore a pair of vintage wide-leg Von Dutch jeans while on tour in 2018, the brand rereleased the style. It\\u2019s currently sold out, Mr. Goldman said.\", \"Some stylists in Los Angeles are banking on nostalgia for the brand, including Sankara Xasha Tur\\u00e9, who dressed Saweetie in a tie-dye Von Dutch sweatsuit last year. Ms. Tur\\u00e9 recalled the rapper\\u2019s ex-boyfriend Quavo borrowing one of her sweatsuits and showcasing it on Instagram, too. \\u201cIt\\u2019s one of those \\u2018I must have it\\u2019 type of deals,\\u201d she said.\", \"Von Dutch, a privately-owned company, is focused on e-commerce these days. However, the line can also be found at a limited selection of street wear retailers across the U.S. While the company would not disclose its earnings, Mr. Goldman described the growth as \\u201castronomical.\\u201d\", \"Morgane Le Caer, the content lead at the global shopping platform Lyst, said that searches for Von Dutch have increased by 148 percent on the site in the last year. \\u201cIn the same way some pop culture celebrities like Britney Spears or Paris Hilton are being reclaimed, the new generation is embracing Y2K fashion trends,\\u201d she wrote in an email.\", \"Maybe it\\u2019s time to find your Ugg boots?\"]","href_hash":"6eb3e20947bd11eca204093294fb90de"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6eb3e20947bd11eca204093294fb90de"}},
