The mortgage lender\\u2019s board announced in a memo sent to staff on Friday that Mr. Garg was \\u201ctaking time off\\u201d after the \\u201cvery regrettable events.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI come to you with not great news,\\u201d Mr. Garg had said to about 9 percent of his staff, in a recording since shared widely online. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re on this call you are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off. Your employment here is terminated effective immediately.\\u201d\", \"Better.com, which is backed by SoftBank, has brought on a third-party firm to assess its leadership and culture, according to a copy of the board\\u2019s memo obtained by The New York Times. Several top employees resigned following the firings, two in communications and one in marketing. Better.com did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.\", \"Christian Chapman, 41, a former underwriting trainer at Better.com, said he was used to preparing for company meetings by making sure his children weren\\u2019t around, because Mr. Garg tended to use foul language. But last Wednesday, when he received an unexpected invitation to the company call with Mr. Garg, he got a sense of foreboding because the chief executive looked so solemn.\", \"As Mr. Garg impassively delivered the news, Mr. Chapman said his \\u201cgut dropped to the floor,\\u201d and he tried to message teammates to ask what was happening but his computer access was shut off almost immediately.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve been through layoffs and usually there\\u2019s closure because you talk to H.R., you go to your desk and grab your personal belongings and say goodbyes,\\u201d Mr. Chapman said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no closure here. You\\u2019re staring at an empty screen in your house.\\u201d\", \"It took about three hours for him to receive a follow-up email, reviewed by The Times, that explained the terms of the termination, Mr. Chapman added. On Thursday, the company increased his termination package from one to two months of pay. He also received a Christmas package containing a trophy, certificate and company T-shirt (which his wife offered to burn).\", \"Mr. Chapman said that the chief executive\\u2019s messaging about fired employees \\u201cstealing\\u201d from the company by working only two hours a day \\u2014 which the former employee said was contradicted by his team\\u2019s recent promotions and raises \\u2014 had made it challenging for them to apply for new jobs.\", \"Mr. Garg has apologized for his behavior on the Zoom call. In a memo dated Tuesday that was posted on the company\\u2019s site, Mr. Garg said he owned the choice to make layoffs but had \\u201cblundered\\u201d the approach.\"]","href_hash":"e648301059d511ec99dfd1b5066c1920"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e648301059d511ec99dfd1b5066c1920"}},
