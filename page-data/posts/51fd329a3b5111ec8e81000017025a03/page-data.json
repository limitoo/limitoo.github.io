The show ends with DelGaudio guessing what every audience member has chosen. When Brennan\\u2019s turn came, DelGaudio said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re a very good comedian.\\u201d \\u201cI was like, \\u2018OK, that\\u2019s cute,\\u2019\\u201d Brennan said.\", \"The pair became friends, and DelGaudio ended up directing Brennan\\u2019s latest show, \\u201cUnacceptable,\\u201d which has just been extended through Nov. 21 at the Cherry Lane Theater in Manhattan.\", \"Because as it turns out, Brennan, 48, is indeed a very good comedian. He cocreated \\u201cChappelle\\u2019s Show\\u201d with Dave Chappelle, with whom he wrote the cult movie \\u201cHalf Baked\\u201d (1998), and directs as well (including such comedy specials as Seth Meyers\\u2019s \\u201cLobby Baby\\u201d and Michelle Wolf\\u2019s \\u201cNice Lady\\u201d).\", \"His own shows have gotten more formally ambitious and introspective, so his collaboration with DelGaudio is not all that surprising, as both of them use familiar genres \\u2014 magic and standup \\u2014 to narratively explore identity, especially as it relates to family. In \\u201cUnacceptable,\\u201d Brennan starts off with a regular joke format before turning toward introspection as he exposes his doubts, neuroses and vulnerabilities. And he remains very funny as he does so.\", \"Brennan, who lives in Los Angeles, spoke on Zoom, from the \\u201ccorporate housing\\u201d where he\\u2019s been staying while in New York, about his top 10 cultural picks. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"1. Reddit You can curate your own interests and just get the top stories or the top posts about them. There are probably people who think it\\u2019s too edited, but I believe in editing. [He scrolls down the categories he follows.] \\u201cBlack People Twitter,\\u201d which is funny tweets from Black people, a lot of time mostly just friends of mine. \\u201cChange My View.\\u201d \\u201cEarthPorn,\\u201d which is just nature. There\\u2019s one called \\u201cChildfree\\u201d where people without children talk about how great it is \\u2014 near and dear to my heart, obviously. \\u201cCodependency,\\u201d even nearer and dearer to my heart.\", \"2. Billy Wilder Arguably the greatest writer-director of all time because he\\u2019s got the best movies in different genres: \\u201cDouble Indemnity\\u201d is one of the best film noirs; \\u201cThe Apartment\\u201d is the greatest romantic comedy; \\u201cAce in the Hole,\\u201d one of the most cynical movies ever. And by the way, I think \\u201cSome Like It Hot\\u201d stinks. It\\u2019s too broad. Some would say, \\u201cWhat about so and so?\\u201d Most of the so and so\\u2019s didn\\u2019t write their own movies. Spielberg? He didn\\u2019t write it, sorry. You can say Christopher Nolan or Tarantino, but those guys don\\u2019t work in multiple genres.\", \"3. Mike Myers One of the best living comedy creators. The guy had two comedy franchises based on characters and worlds he created. That\\u2019s unbelievable. When I was in film school, I walked out of \\u201cWayne\\u2019s World\\u201d and said \\u2014 and I still kind of believe this \\u2014 \\u201cthat\\u2019s the best movie I\\u2019ve ever seen.\\u201d It\\u2019s incredibly hard to take the spirit of sketch comedy and make narratives like he did in both \\u201cWayne\\u2019s Worlds.\\u201d He\\u2019s the kind of guy that it would be hard for me to be around because I respect him so much. The guy\\u2019s a titan.\", \"4. Sweetgreen Mike Schur [the creator of \\u201cThe Good Place\\u201d] and I used to write together. I\\u2019d gotten a scale, and we weighed ourselves and it was not a good number for either of us. We were like, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve got to start eating healthy.\\u201d This is probably around 1999, when salad places started, and I\\u2019ve kind of had salad for lunch every day since. Sweetgreen entered the picture, and they have a spicy cashew dressing that\\u2019s a showstopper. It is not for the faint of heart, and you\\u2019re going to need help. You\\u2019re going to have to call in for backup, and that backup is sugar-free Juicy Fruit. I don\\u2019t know what fruit they\\u2019re speaking of, but I like that they keep it vague.\", \"5. Ayahuasca A friend texted me a story in The New York Times and said, \\u201cWe should do this.\\u201d I\\u2019m at the age now where I get my drug ideas from The New York Times. It\\u2019s been transformative psychologically. It\\u2019s changed my mental outlook and my emotional disposition. It took me from being an atheist to a believer in a spiritual center of the universe that I\\u2019m a sliver of. And for a couple hundred bucks a session. If you\\u2019re talking about R.O.I., return on investment, it\\u2019s pretty good.\", \"6. iPhone editing apps I went to film school in 1991, and there were still reels. I remember getting a digital camera in 2000, and even then it was a giant contraption. Everything was a giant pain. On \\u201cChappelle\\u2019s Show,\\u201d I used to have to run physical videotapes from the editing office to the taping. You tell someone that now, they\\u2019d be like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about?\\u201d So the idea that I can edit a thing on the same machine where I can check the internet, it\\u2019s such a miracle. I\\u2019ve missed flights because I was just editing videos on my phone.\", \"7. Bill Burr We all talk about him in somewhat hushed tones, but I don\\u2019t think people who aren\\u2019t in comedy know how good he is. He\\u2019s so good at stand-up, it\\u2019s breathtaking. He\\u2019s made some of the best comedy specials of the last 15 years. I don\\u2019t even think he likes me as a person, and I don\\u2019t care.\", \"8. Kanye West No one has contributed more to culture in the last 15 years. The guy made what I consider one of the best albums of all time, \\u201cMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,\\u201d and the best sneakers. \\u201cYeah, but he also said that slavery was a choice.\\u201d OK, and then what happened? Nothing happened. It\\u2019s not like the Slavery Was a Choice Act was passed. He just said something stupid because he\\u2019s mentally ill. And I like that he\\u2019s open about being mentally ill \\u2014 he had \\u201cI hate being Bi-Polar its awesome\\u201d on the cover of \\u201cYe.\\u201d He\\u2019s made seven good albums in a row. Eric Clapton says dumb [expletive], but his music sucks. Corporations are ruining our environment, but they\\u2019re held to a lower standard than Kanye.\", \"9. Grand Theft Auto It\\u2019s arguably the greatest cultural achievement of my lifetime, if not ever. I don\\u2019t think you can be too hyperbolic with it. It\\u2019s a joke, and it\\u2019s true. I was in a car in Miami one time, and I was like, \\u201cWhen was I here before?\\u201d And it was in the video game. The worlds are massive, and you can drive around in different neighborhoods. It\\u2019s like being on a morphine drip. A beautiful, catatonic morphine drip.\", \"10. Errol Morris He\\u2019s made zero bad movies. He\\u2019s reinvented the [documentary] genre with the re-enactments and the new way to interview people with the Interrotron. He made other people just steal Philip Glass music for their own documentaries. And the funny thing is, he makes commercials for Chipotle. I direct commercials sometimes, and whenever I get, like, \\u201cAm I not an artist?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cErrol Morris does Chipotle commercials, what are we talking about?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"51fd329a3b5111ec8e81000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"51fd329a3b5111ec8e81000017025a03"}},
