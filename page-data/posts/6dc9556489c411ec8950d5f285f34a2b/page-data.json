The agency halted a 2019 rule that made it more difficult for low-income immigrants to obtain permanent residency and reversed some asylum restrictions.\", \"But USCIS, which is mainly funded by application fees, continues to struggle with a mounting backlog of petitions that have crippled its ability to review cases in a timely manner, and the agency still largely relies on paper records.\", \"It also has yet to implement several key Biden administration policy proposals, including a plan to revamp the asylum process at the U.S.-Mexico border and a rule to shield the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program from legal challenges.\", \"Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.
