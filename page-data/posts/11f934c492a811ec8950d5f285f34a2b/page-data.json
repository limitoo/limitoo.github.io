It would be tricky to get people back in full-time, if that's what we wanted to do.\\\"\", \"Another office worker said they didn't even feel like working from home was an option - even though it would make no difference to their day to day activities.\", \"\\\"I feel like it'd be ostracised if you seem to have a preference to work from home,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Personally, I think I'd actually prefer to work in the office, but I don't think I could even raise the issue with them.\\\"\", \"Another manager told RNZ his workplace used to offer flexible hours and the ability to work from home as an incentive, but now so many workplaces were offering flexible working options it had lost its edge.\", \"University of Auckland associate professor of psychology Niki Harr\\u00e9 said rock-solid boundaries were key when working from home.\", \"\\\"I think the problem is that you can start to be really messy in how you work,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"For example many people, like me, have two email addresses. So, you check your work one and then your own one, and maybe you see there's a special on for a pair of shoes that you like, and you look at that and then feel a bit guilty.\", \"\\\"Then you think, 'It's okay, I'll work for an extra five minutes today' and it all gets really confused in your mind as to how much work you've actually done.\\\"\", \"Without the structure a traditional office environment provides, people can ultimately work longer hours, but have less to show for it, Harr\\u00e9 said.\", \"She had some tips for people struggling to keep on track.\", \"\\\"I use a pomodoro app that gives you 25 minutes to work and then five minutes for a break.\", \"\\\"And it means that I can actually, in those five minutes, hang out my washing without feeling guilty, because that is my break.\", \"\\\"It really structures your day in a way that, I think, has been incredibly helpful.\\\"\", \"She also recommended keeping track of how many hours you've actually worked - rather than sitting down in your makeshift office first thing in the morning and only leaving when everything's finished.\", \"It was important to remember that not everyone would be able do their jobs remotely, or have the resources to, Harr\\u00e9 said.\", \"Jane Kennelly said some employers needed to wake up and smell the home-brewed coffee - or staff will vote with their feet, and leave.\", \"\\\"If employers don't get this, they will lose their people and then they have to re-employ,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Tell me productivity losses, when you lose significant people in your business and you try to re-employ in an employment market like this.\", \"\\\"It is a recipe for absolute further disaster.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"11f934c492a811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"11f934c492a811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
