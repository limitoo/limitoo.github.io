In the 2012 music video for Maroon 5\\u2019s \\u201cLove Somebody,\\u201d Adam Levine smears gray paint over Ratajkowski\\u2019s body, which is rendered into space by his touch like a cringy interpretation of \\u201cPygmalion.\\u201d The following year, the model appeared in Robin Thicke\\u2019s notorious video for \\u201cBlurred Lines.\\u201d I watched these while reading her aptly titled debut collection, frustrated to see the author cast as a mannequin to be used by these painfully less interesting men.\", \"The shock of the misogyny and abuse Ratajkowski details over the course of her career is not dulled by its predictability. Partly this is due to her engaging narrative voice, its humor and sincerity. As a well-known model, actor and entrepreneur, Ratajkowski often worries about her own participation in harmful systems. \\u201cMoney means power,\\u201d she ponders while on a sponsored luxury vacation in the Maldives. \\u201cAnd by capitalizing on my sexuality I have money.\\u201d Her interest in this complicity seems genuine, and the question she returns to, though timeworn, has no easy answer: How do we thrive \\u2014 ethically \\u2014 in a society that runs on exploitation? The book feels like an awakening-in-progress, and she acknowledges that: \\u201cThe purpose of this book is not to arrive at answers, but to honestly explore ideas I can\\u2019t help but return to.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMy Body\\u201d succeeds at this. It offers a lucid examination of the mirrors in which its author has seen herself, and her indoctrination into the cult of beauty as defined by powerful men. In one of its more transcendent passages, she compares the 2007 paparazzi photo of Britney Spears with a newly shaved head to Vermeer\\u2019s \\u201cGirl With a Pearl Earring.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s pulled back from the mirror, not looking at us but past us,\\u201d Ratajkowski writes. \\u201cBut whereas the girl in the painting has a turban covering her head, Britney\\u2019s hair is gone and in its place is her shockingly naked scalp. It surprises you. It feels violent, a warning.\\u201d In such ruminations, the author steps beyond the reach of any \\u201cPygmalion\\u201d and becomes a more dangerous kind of beautiful. She becomes a kind of god in her own right: an artist.\", \"TOUFAH The Woman Who Inspired an African #MeToo Movement By Toufah Jallow With Kim PittawayIllustrated. 310 pp. Truth to Power. Paper, $16.95.\", \"In this riveting autobiography, Jallow details how at 18 she won a pageant sponsored by Yahya Jammeh, the then-president of Gambia. A university scholarship was promised as the prize, but what she got instead was a series of gifts and grooming visits from the president that culminated in a marriage proposal. After the teenager refused, an enraged Jammeh drugged and brutally raped her. \\u201cThere is no word for rape in the Fula language,\\u201d Jallow explains, not because it doesn\\u2019t happen, but \\u201cbecause we are supposed to believe it is so rare that no word is necessary for it.\\u201d Understanding the danger to herself and her family, Jallow fled her native country into neighboring Senegal, eventually locating sympathetic authorities who helped her secure refugee status in Canada.\", \"The tale of Jallow\\u2019s escape is harrowing and propulsive. While her trauma is extreme, the real story takes place in its aftermath, in the ways it defined the victim\\u2019s life. Reluctant to tell fellow refugees her back story and fearful that local Gambians had heard slandering media reports about her, Jallow sank into depression and isolation. When she finally breached her silence to a friend and then a therapist, the mantle lifted to reveal a molten determination.\", \"In 2016, Jammeh lost re-election but refused to concede. Only after the United Nations Security Council denounced him, and the Gambian Embassy in Senegal swore in Adama Barrow as president, did Jammeh flee the country. Despite the risks, Jallow decided to testify at the hearings that followed. \\u201cAs I shared the details of the night I was raped,\\u201d she recounts, \\u201cI knew I was doing something shocking, something Gambians had not seen.\\u201d In her rousing final remarks, she invokes the national custom of apologizing for one\\u2019s testimony: \\u201cIt offends men like Yahya Jammeh. It offends men who want to sympathize with perpetrators. And to those people: I am not sorry.\\u201d\", \"It takes extraordinary courage and vision to induce social change in a single lifetime, and Jallow has done just that. Now 25, she lives in Toronto, where she\\u2019s studying to become a counselor for assaulted women and children. By the end, her work has had an impact at home, too \\u2014 her baby sister marching around repeating her words: \\u201cI. Am. Not. Sorry!\\u201d\", \"FLESH & BLOOD Reflections on Infertility, Family, and Creating a Bountiful LifeBy N. West Moss 307 pp. Algonquin. $25.95.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve come to understand that there is a kind of storing up of beauty, an accumulation of memory,\\u201d Moss writes near the end of her first book of nonfiction (after a story collection, \\u201cThe Subway Stops at Bryant Park\\u201d). Across 82 short chapters, it meanders through the author\\u2019s life, musing on a treasured relationship with her grandmother, her father\\u2019s death, a happy marriage and the grief of multiple miscarriages. Moss interlaces episodes from the past with a present timeline in which she is suffering from a mysterious and bloody medical condition whose eventual diagnosis necessitates a hysterectomy, followed by a complicated recovery. It is an intimate and ruminative portrait of life in an aging body, the hardships of navigating medical crises and the importance of loving care.\", \"Throughout, Moss\\u2019s voice is conversational, punctuated with frequent ellipses and colloquialisms: \\u201cOh well.\\u201d \\u201cShoot.\\u201d \\u201cJesus.\\u201d Its narration unspools to reveal the movement of her mind behind the prose, and at times Moss\\u2019s candor makes this discursive style effective, like when she laments the impending loss of \\u201cthe silky, slippery nose of my cervix, who never did anything to anyone.\\u201d At other times, however, it becomes tediously self-conscious, laden with superfluous details, more stream of consciousness than story. And yet, there is often meaning and depth to be found in the miscellany of life. Especially, perhaps, in the life of a middle-aged woman, a demographic whose interior and corporeal narratives are so often dismissed by a patriarchal, youth-obsessed culture.\", \"The memoir genre has a long and valuable tradition of chronicling such ordinary, older lives that demonstrate how to find meaning in our own. There is beauty to be found in the transcription of small wonders \\u2014 in Moss\\u2019s case, a praying mantis laying her eggs, a well-made cup of broth, the warmth of a beloved pet at your feet. For many, I trust, this account will provide company and insight into the tragedies and delights of middle age. Who among us doesn\\u2019t need a reminder that \\u201cit turns out that you can be filled to overflowing with grief and still be happy\\u201d?\"]","href_hash":"c3a17e503e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c3a17e503e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}},
