And if Molly isn't there then I use a different pair of stairs to go downstairs to have coffee.\", \"\\\"And these are the stairs. These are the Victorian servant stairs, and they're so dangerous. I have to go down sideways, and hold on. See how narrow they are.\\\"\", \"The on-screen captions go into more detail, saying: \\\"Taking the Victorian servant stairs in the morning.\", \"\\\"Victorian stairs could be referred to as \\\"hidden killers.\\\" Made too narrow and too steep, with irregular steps, the servants' staircase was a deadly construction.\", \"\\\"Add the weight of carrying trays or the complication of long skirts the stairs could easily prove fatal.\\\"\", \"The video, captioned \\\"constructed in 1890 for use by the cook & servant who lived above,\\\" has been watched more than four million times since being uploaded last month, and can be seen here.\", \"Due to the popularity of the clip, Kim shared some follow-up videos going into more detail about the main staircase, built in the 1700s, as well as her adorable pet.\", \"\\\"For those asking, we have a front set of steps, and their coolest feature is that they split, to go to one side of the house, or the other side of the house.\", \"\\\"And then these are the back Victorian stairs.
