For two years now, our ability to actively support live sport has either been eliminated entirely or restricted.\", \"That's about to change and many administrators will hope that fans flock back. It's just that so many of us have become accustomed to not going and, often, not actually caring either.\", \"Let's start with the national game. Super Rugby Pacific is a poor competition. It just is.\", \"The franchise model has been tweaked and tinkered with to the extent that general sports fans have lost touch with the format and who's actually playing.\", \"Super Rugby is a terribly pale imitation of its former self because, at least in my opinion, we've let too many talented players and coaches go overseas. The product isn't as good, because few of the personnel are as good.\", \"No amount of new teams, new time slots and new playing conditions can change that.\", \"The competition has ceased to be relevant to those beyond the rugby beltway and that's a big problem.\", \"Even the All Blacks don't generate the interest they used to.\", \"I'll use last year's tour to Europe as an example.\", \"Time was when being outplayed and beaten by both Ireland and France would elicit outrage.

Only, they're so infrequent that they have a novelty value that sets them slightly apart from the more run-of-the-mill stuff fans are turning their backs on.\", \"Take a sport such as cricket, which our governing body has made irrelevant. The Black Caps are barely visible in this country and won't be attracting any eyeballs when they meet the Netherlands.\", \"I suspect New Zealand Cricket (NZC) has misgivings about throwing its lot in with Spark and wouldn't be surprised if they soon link with a broadcaster with broader reach.\", \"But the Black Caps aren't alone in losing their relevance.\", \"The White Ferns, for instance, are irrelevant for a different reason. They don't win when they need to, giving fans nothing to get behind.\", \"How relevant are the New Zealand Breakers or the Wellington Phoenix? What about the New Zealand Warriors?\", \"Each have a committed fanbase, but who else watches or takes an interest?\", \"We lampooned poor Michael Campbell for years but, boy, what we wouldn't give now for a male golfer capable of winning or contending in majors.\", \"Not only did Campbell win a US Open and a World Matchplay title, but results such as third at The Open Championship and sixth at the PGA Championship gave rank-and-file sports fans something to get excited about.\", \"Lydia Ko is an outstanding golfer and, while I watch most LPGA Tour events, not too many others do.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/285510/eight_col_TROPHY.jpg?1643740759\\\" alt=\\\"Lydia Ko holds the tournament trophy after winning the Gainbridge LPGA 2022.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nLydia Ko \\nPhoto: PHOTOSPORT\\n</div>\", \"Combat sports, such as boxing and UFC, have their loyal enthusiasts but I'm not among them and nor are the masses.\", \"Like Super Rugby, ANZ Championship netball isn't what it was.
