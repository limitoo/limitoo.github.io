When my doctor told me that I ought to be able to tolerate a pregnancy well enough, I was jubilant.\", \"The only decision we needed to make in the immediate future, he said, was whether to try and conceive naturally or whether to undergo IVF for the purposes of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.\", \"You see, I have a hereditary medical condition which, while not life-limiting, can cause some health problems. In my case, it has caused degenerative vision loss leading to near-blindness.\", \"I had told my husband, pre-nuptials, that any children would have a 50 per cent chance of inheriting my condition, and that was that. But there is a difference between passively accepting that your child might be disabled, and choosing to do nothing to prevent it.\", \"To help us make that choice, we went to see a genetics counsellor. She confirmed that, if affected, our child's condition would be roughly similar to mine. Their vision might start out better or worse, and they may respond better to treatment to preserve their sight. But on the whole, there wouldn't be much difference.\", \"This was important to me. I knew I didn't have the emotional strength to carry a baby if there was a substantial probability that they would die in infancy. Had the counsellor told us our baby's condition could be life-threatening, we would have undertaken IVF immediately, rather than trying to conceive naturally. Instead, we wavered.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">A difficult path, regardless</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e56b154d44739ae78971d21442a9743f\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Jennelle Schroder is at home with her baby, playing on the sofa.(ABC News: Brendan Esposito)</div>\", \"For the uninitiated, IVF requires a woman to inject herself with hormones for a month to cause a rush in egg production. She then has a short anaesthetic procedure so that doctors can collect the eggs.\", \"They're fertilised and roughly half will successfully form embryos. Only half of those embryos will grow to be five days old. The healthiest-looking embryo is then transferred back into the woman in the hopes of jump-starting a pregnancy.\", \"It's costly, invasive, and failure is common before eventual success. But this soon became irrelevant for us. We couldn't conceive naturally, and had to undergo IVF regardless.\", \"That still left us to decide whether or not to screen our embryos for my disability.\", \"We quickly dispensed with the large ethical concerns over a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Some say it is unethical to knowingly afflict disability on both a child and society. Others say that specifically preventing the birth of disabled children is the latest in an ugly history of eugenics practices that seek to eradicate a marginalised community.\", \"It's not that none of that mattered to us, it just didn't matter as much.\", \"For me, the debate was easily resolved. To debate the morality of knowingly afflicting a child with my disability, I'd have to accept that I'm afflicted.\", \"I don't.\", \"But I resolved that this couldn't be about me. We decided that if we were going to make this decision for our baby, then it had to be about them.\", \"And they were the only person to whom we were accountable.\", \"So, even as we worried over whether we'd regret it, or if they'd blame us, there was really only one question that mattered.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How would we explain our decision to our child?</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/feb08af9dc2e8eb1d1d7f68d583139c2\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"If we intervened, it would be easy. We wanted to give our baby the very best start in life and PGD would help us do that. I worried that, having chosen this way, they'd grow to think disability made me inferior.\", \"But this wasn't about me.\", \"It would be much harder to explain not intervening. If our child became disabled, how could we justify not having prevented them any pain or adversity they might experience?\", \"But there was a third option, thanks to the process of PGD.\", \"Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis works by taking a cell sample from a three-day-old embryo. The embryo is frozen while the cells are tested for a particular disability, and only that disability. Any embryos that test positive will not be used to start a pregnancy, regardless of how otherwise-healthy they appear.\", \"This, for us, was the crux of the matter. PGD is not a cure-all. It would not prevent our child from having a disability. It would attempt to keep us from having a disabled child.\", \"Twenty per cent of Australia's population is disabled. There are hundreds of congenital and acquired disabilities that affect children, and PGD would only detect mine.\", \"If we chose to genetically select our baby, and they were born disabled anyway, how would we explain to them that we'd tried to avoid having a disabled child and it hadn't worked?\", \"We chose, instead, to welcome our baby with unconditional joy. Knowing and accepting that our child might have a disability robbed it of fear.\", \"That's not to say it was smooth sailing from there. Being first-time parents, there's still been plenty for us to worry about.\", \"We don't yet know for certain whether our daughter has inherited my condition. Now that she's here, not knowing is more challenging than it was while I was pregnant.\", \"But every time I teeter on the edge of regret, I am reminded of how much I love her. In six months, her individuality has bloomed.\", \"And, should she ever have reason to ask me, in a moment of adversity, why I did not choose to prevent it for her, this will be my answer.\", \"I could not have prevented it for her.\", \"And I would not have chosen to prevent her in favour of another child.\"]","href_hash":"76dfeb2252ec11ec9d35e1ca8f9b40fd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"76dfeb2252ec11ec9d35e1ca8f9b40fd"}},
