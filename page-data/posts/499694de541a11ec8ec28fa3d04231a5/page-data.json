We\\u2019ll look at something that a lot of us have been doing more of \\u2014 biking \\u2014 and how demand during the pandemic has put pressure on Citi Bike. We\\u2019ll also look at a statue that was designed in Brooklyn for installation at the Kennedy Center in Washington.\", \"It seems clear that New York will emerge from the pandemic as a place where biking is more important than ever. Advocates say the trend needs to be encouraged to keep cars off the streets, which would help ease climate change.\", \"But Citi Bike, the bicycle-share program operated by Lyft, has struggled to meet the surge in demand. My colleague Ana Ley writes that some riders in high-traffic neighborhoods only find empty docks when they are rushing to get somewhere. Others complain about docking stations that are full, making it difficult to return bikes. One Citi Bike regular, Christiane Bussgen, tried six full stations before giving up and taking her bike to the office. (The fruitless search made her late to work.)\", \"Citi Bike has said that unpredictable commuting patterns and the increase in ridership made it hard to distribute bikes and docks evenly during the pandemic. Now the company and the city\\u2019s Transportation Department plan to add 8,000 docks and 4,000 bikes by the end of next year \\u2014 largely in Manhattan, but also in parts of Queens and Brooklyn \\u2014 on the way to a total of 75,000 docks and 40,000 bikes by the end of 2024.\", \"Still, more than four million people \\u2014 nearly half the city\\u2019s population \\u2014 live outside Citi Bike\\u2019s Manhattan-centric service area, prompting frequent criticism of the privately funded program. In a report released on Wednesday, the Transportation Department suggested the city should consider a government subsidy to help Citi Bike reach underserved neighborhoods. A similar idea has been mentioned by Eric Adams, the incoming mayor, who traveled to at least one campaign news conference via Citi Bike.\", \"Motorists and some elected officials complain that the increase in bike sharing has made parking and driving tougher. Residents of some parts of the city say reckless cyclists run red lights or thread their way along sidewalks. And, in a year when traffic deaths have increased significantly, cycling advocates say the city must find ways to make the streets safer.\", \"Jeffrey LeFrancois, the executive director of a business improvement group in Manhattan\\u2019s Meatpacking district, said the pandemic had given the city a chance to be more ambitious about making cycling essential. \\u201cI think that we are sort of at a real moment of exciting opportunity to be bold as it relates to bike infrastructure,\\u201d he said.\", \"Some riders wish the infrastructure were more efficient now.\", \"Dina Vovsi, a theater director who lives in Brooklyn, is among those who have had to return Citi Bikes far from home when no docks were available nearby.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve had those nights where it\\u2019s so cold and late and I just want to be inside with my dog eating ice cream,\\u201d she said, \\u201cand I\\u2019ve had to park more than a mile away.\\u201d\", \"Enjoy a sunny but somewhat windy day with temps in the mid-40s. It will be a partly cloudy evening in the mid-30s.\", \"In effect until Dec. 8 (Immaculate Conception).\", \"The city expanded its push for vaccination, requiring employees at Catholic schools, yeshivas and other private schools to be inoculated against the coronavirus. Officials said the directive would cover roughly 930 schools and 56,000 employees who must show that they have received a first dose by Dec. 20.\", \"The new rule could face opposition at yeshivas, ultra-Orthodox Jewish private schools.\", \"The requirement was announced on Thursday as Gov. Kathy Hochul said that everyone who attended the Anime NYC 2021 convention at the Javits Center last month should get tested. A Minnesota man who was there tested positive for the Omicron variant. Ms. Hochul and Mayor Bill de Blasio said later in the day that five cases of the variant had been confirmed in New York State.\", \"You probably think this is statue week at New York Today. I didn\\u2019t plan it, but it\\u2019s true: On Monday we looked at \\u201cFearless Girl,\\u201d the defiant figure across from the New York Stock Exchange whose permit expired, and on Tuesday, the Theodore Roosevelt statue that is going to North Dakota.\", \"Today? A John F. Kennedy that had its stride lengthened and its hair smoothed down in Brooklyn, where it also got a bit of what one of its creators called Kennedyesque \\u201coptimism.\\u201d All this was before it went to Washington, where it will be dedicated tomorrow.\", \"It was commissioned for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which opened 50 years ago. It is to be unveiled on Saturday at a ceremony where the cellist Yo-Yo Ma will perform. As a 7-year-old in 1962, he played at a \\u201cpageant of the arts\\u201d fund-raiser when what became the Kennedy Center was known as the National Cultural Center.\", \"The statue was created at StudioEIS (pronounced \\u201cstudio ice\\u201d), which prides itself on historically accurate figures like the statues of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln that it made for the New-York Historical Society.\", \"\\u201cKennedy represented for me a different kind of challenge,\\u201d said Ivan Schwartz, who founded StudioEIS with his brother Elliot in 1976, \\u201cbecause I was a kid at the time and we all experienced the assassination. So when we were asked to do this, it meant traveling back down that road.\\u201d\", \"His team studied photographs and videotape. Along the way, Schwartz decided to make the statue a walking figure. That sets it apart from the craggy bust of Kennedy that has stood in the Grand Foyer since the Kennedy Center opened. The StudioEIS statue will go outside, where Schwartz said it would complement the \\u201cdynamism\\u201d of the Reach, an expansion project completed in 2019.\", \"The conversation with Schwartz turned to the where-were-you-when question. On Nov. 22, 1963, he was a seventh-grader at Grand Avenue Junior High School in Merrick, N.Y., on Long Island.\", \"\\u201cThe loudspeaker came on and you heard the principal\\u2019s voice first,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd then we heard Walter Cronkite, and then we were all sent home. The immensity was understood even by us 12-year-old kids.\\u201d\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"I was hurrying down Third Avenue early one evening at the time of year when it\\u2019s already pitch dark by then.\", \"An older woman was shuffling up the street in the opposite direction, one gloved hand tightly clutching the lapels of a bulky coat. As I passed her, I saw a leash attached to an empty collar trailing from her other hand.\", \"I almost stopped and said something, but mind-my-own-business excuses kept my mouth closed and my feet moving.\", \"She must know it is empty, I thought to myself. Perhaps this was a ritual, walking the same walk with a dog that could no longer accompany her. I dismissed the encounter from my mind and continued on my way.\", \"A block and a half later, my eyes landed on something I didn\\u2019t know I was looking for: a tiny white poodle with no leash and no collar that was wandering timidly among a crowd of people waiting for the light to change.\", \"\\u201cIs this your dog?\\u201d I asked generally, already knowing the answer.\", \"Scooping the poodle into my arms without thinking about whether it was friendly, I began to run back the way I had come. I kept wondering what would I do if the woman had already turned off Third Avenue. As I ran, the dog snuggled against me.\", \"Near the next corner, I saw the woman again, her coat flapping open as she hurried down the street.\", \"Her eyes were searching the sidewalk so frantically that she would have passed me if I hadn\\u2019t stopped her and held out her joyfully wriggling poodle.\", \"\\u2014 Jane Excell\", \"Illustrated by Agnes Lee.
