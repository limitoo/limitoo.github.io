Of course, the answer was yes. \\u201cYou got some time?\\u201d he asked, before laughing, loudly, with a sense of mischief: \\u201cIt\\u2019s from a show called \\u2018Fat Chance\\u2019!\\u201d\", \"That was Sunday afternoon, five days ago, when Mr. Sondheim, 91, had welcomed me to his longtime country house for a 90-minute interview with him and the theater director Marianne Elliott about a revival of \\u201cCompany\\u201d that is now in previews on Broadway. It would turn out to be his final major interview.\", \"There was little indication that Mr. Sondheim, one of the greatest songwriters in the history of musical theater, was unwell. He was engaged and lucid, with strong opinions and playfully pugnacious, as with the tease about his long-gestating, unfinished final musical. At one moment he complained that his memory wasn\\u2019t as strong as it had been, but he was also telling anecdotes from a half-century earlier with ease.\", \"He was having a little trouble getting around \\u2014 using a cane, seeking assistance to get in and out of chairs, and in obvious pain when walking \\u2014 which he attributed to an injury. Asked about the state of his health, he answered by knocking on a wood table and saying, \\u201cOutside of my sprained ankle, OK.\\u201d\", \"He was busy right until the end. On Nov. 14 he attended the opening of an Off Broadway revival of his musical \\u201cAssassins,\\u201d directed by John Doyle at Classic Stage Company. The next night he went to the first post-shutdown preview for the Broadway revival of \\u201cCompany\\u201d \\u2014 a reimagined production, opening Dec. 9, in which the protagonist, who has traditionally been played by a man, is now played by a woman. And just this week, two days before he died, he did a doubleheader, seeing a Wednesday matinee of \\u201cIs This a Room\\u201d and an evening performance of \\u201cDana H.,\\u201d two short documentary plays on Broadway.\", \"\\u201cI can\\u2019t wait,\\u201d he said as he anticipated seeing those shows. \\u201cI can smell both of those and how much I\\u2019m going to love them.\\u201d\", \"He was not inclined to make any grand pronouncements on the state of Broadway. \\u201cI don\\u2019t take overviews \\u2014 I never have taken overviews,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhither Broadway? I don\\u2019t answer the question. Who knows. I don\\u2019t really care. That\\u2019s the future. Whatever happens will happen.\\u201d\", \"One thing he was hoping would happen: one more musical. For years he had been collaborating with the playwright David Ives and the director Joe Mantello on a new musical, most recently titled \\u201cSquare One,\\u201d adapted from two movies directed by Luis Bu\\u00f1uel.\", \"\\u201cThe first act is based on \\u2018The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,\\u2019 and the second act is based on \\u2018The Exterminating Angel,\\u2019 \\u201d he explained during the interview. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if I should give the so-called plot away, but the first act is a group of people trying to find a place to have dinner, and they run into all kinds of strange and surreal things, and in the second act, they find a place to have dinner, but they can\\u2019t get out.\\u201d\", \"Asked if he had any sense when it might be finished, Mr. Sondheim said, \\u201cNo.\\u201d\", \"Why did he hope to keep working when he could just bask in appreciation?\", \"\\u201cWhat else am I going to do?\\u201d he asked. \\u201cI\\u2019m too old now to do a lot of traveling, I\\u2019m sorry to say. What else would I do with my time but write?\\u201d\", \"And did he write daily in his final weeks? \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m a procrastinator,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI need a collaborator who pushes me, who gets impatient.\\u201d\", \"When it was pointed out that he had been a procrastinator throughout his career, and that it had seemed to work for him, he said, \\u201cYes, I have. Yeah, I think forever. Not when I was a hungry teenager \\u2014 when I wanted so much to have a show done, I don\\u2019t think I was a procrastinator then. But once I had a show done, I think part of me got lazy.\\u201d\", \"But with his shows running on Broadway and off, and a major film adaptation of \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d about to be released, Mr. Sondheim was clearly feeling good about the current reception of his work.\", \"He confirmed his longstanding lack of interest in movie musicals, saying, \\u201cGrowing up, I was a huge fan of movies, and the only genre that I wasn\\u2019t a fan of was musicals \\u2014 I loved the songs, but not the musicals.\\u201d\", \"But he was obviously delighted about the Steven Spielberg-directed film adaptation of \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d a musical for which Mr. Sondheim wrote the lyrics, that is scheduled to be released next month. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s just great,\\u201d he said. He added, \\u201cThe great thing about it is people who think they know the musical are going to have surprises.\\u201d\", \"He was looking forward to even more in the months to come: a new production of \\u201cInto the Woods,\\u201d for which Mr. Sondheim wrote the music and lyrics, is scheduled to be staged by the Encores! program at New York City Center next May. Also, Mr. Sondheim revealed, New York Theater Workshop is hoping to stage an Off Broadway revival of \\u201cMerrily We Roll Along,\\u201d for which he wrote the music and lyrics, directed by Maria Friedman, who has previously directed well received productions in London and Boston.\", \"Asked which of his shows he\\u2019d most like to see revived next, he appeared stumped. \\u201cWhat would I like to see again that I haven\\u2019t seen in a while? I\\u2019d have to think about it, because an awful lot of the shows I\\u2019ve been a writer of have been done in the last few years.\\u201d He added, \\u201cI\\u2019ve been lucky. I\\u2019ve had good revivals of the shows that I like.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f9ef1ba04f2211ec9d9f1768e5382659"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f9ef1ba04f2211ec9d9f1768e5382659"}},
