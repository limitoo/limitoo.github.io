More slinking, fox-like body movements. And \\u2014 gosh darn it \\u2014 more comb! (His character runs his fingers through a comb\\u2019s teeth when he\\u2019s anxious.)\", \"\\u201cI was always thinking \\u2018This is too much,\\u2019\\u201d said Smit-McPhee, 25, his willowy 6-foot-2 frame and wide-set eyes filling the screen in a video call from his family\\u2019s home in Melbourne, Australia. \\u201cBut I tend to unconsciously underplay my characters, so it\\u2019s a constant that directors ask me to turn it up a little bit.\\u201d\", \"Smit-McPhee\\u2019s character, Peter, is the quiet heart of Campion\\u2019s western, now in theaters and streaming on Netflix: a shy teen who both irks and brings out the softer side of a masochistic cowboy, Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch), raising cattle in rural Montana in the 1920s. (The film was shot in Campion\\u2019s native New Zealand.)\", \"\\u201cI think the first impression is, \\u2018This kid\\u2019s obviously light on his feet, so delicate, possibly na\\u00efve,\\u2019\\u201d said Smit-McPhee, who, in a black T-shirt and ball cap, is self-assured and philosophical in real life. \\u201cBut we come to learn he has a greater strength to him.\\u201d\", \"While Smit-McPhee read the script and Thomas Savage\\u2019s 1967 novel, he enjoyed the role\\u2019s ambiguity, which he said allowed him to arrive at his own interpretation of Peter\\u2019s motivations. He worked with an accent specialist, a body movement coach and did meditation and dream work, all in the service of challenging himself to deliver the most nuanced performance.\", \"\\u201cJane pushed me to explore new territory,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was only a couple of nights before I went to bed thinking, \\u2018I\\u2019m going to need to completely commit to this.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The role is the latest in a career built on sensitive, inquisitive characters. Smit-McPhee first gained notice as a son navigating a postapocalyptic hellscape with his father in the 2009 adaptation of Cormac McCarthy\\u2019s \\u201cThe Road,\\u201d before playing a bullied boy who falls in love with a vampire in the 2010 horror romance \\u201cLet Me In\\u201d and the devilish but kind-at-heart Nightcrawler in the recent \\u201cX-Men\\u201d films.\", \"In an hourlong conversation, Smit-McPhee discussed how his struggle with chronic pain helped him related to Peter\\u2019s outsider status and what he makes of the film\\u2019s ending. These are edited excerpts.\", \"The first time you met with Jane Campion, in Los Angeles in 2019, she asked you to have a conversation in character as Peter. What was that like?\", \"It was very freeing and forgiving in comparison to other auditions I\\u2019ve done. From a director\\u2019s perspective, you get to see how much this actor has understood the psyche of the character and filled in the blanks in the script. I tried to get as far away from my own thoughts as possible.\", \"What in Peter do you relate to?\", \"Physically, the people around him tend to judge him to be a bit weak or not man enough. That\\u2019s something he was dealing with 100 years ago, and we\\u2019re still dealing with today \\u2014 negative effects on how you view yourself when you\\u2019re told you\\u2019re not strong enough, or people assume that about you. But in the same breath, when you understand what value you bring to the world and others, you gain a confidence and a love for yourself.\", \"In one scene, he dissects a rabbit he\\u2019s killed in his bedroom. Are you squeamish around blood?\", \"I\\u2019m not squeamish when it comes to blood, but I\\u2019m 100-percent squeamish when it comes to flesh being cut. My girlfriend watches these shows like \\u201cNip/Tuck\\u201d and \\u201cBotched,\\u201d and I feel sick when I try to make myself watch those gruesome scenes. But in the spirit of Peter, I forced myself to in order to familiarize myself with it.\", \"Despite not being a pillar of traditional masculinity, Peter is remarkably self-assured. Where does that confidence come from?\", \"I believe it has a great deal to do with the environment he was raised in, which was very secluded and isolated, as well as his experience of trauma \\u2014 he had to physically cut his own father down when he committed suicide. Because he was isolated, he didn\\u2019t have any expectations of others to live up to in terms of how he dealt with his traumas.\", \"When you were 16, you were diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, a medical condition that causes vertebrae to fuse and results in chronic pain. Did you relate to Peter\\u2019s sense of being an outsider?\", \"Absolutely. I wasn\\u2019t as physically capable as other kids, and that brought me a lot of grief in my younger years before I learned how to deal with it. But I used the chronic pain and the emotions to fuel me further into my endeavor with curiosity. I found myself in libraries a lot; I would find heaps of books on things that transmuted apathy into a sense of control or freedom. But my knowledge didn\\u2019t help me become someone who wasn\\u2019t an outcast, it just made me grateful for being an outcast because of where it took me intellectually, spiritually and physically.\", \"Your vision was impaired in your left eye while shooting the film because of a severe cataract related to your condition \\u2014 which means the scene where you catch a matchbox must have been pretty difficult.\", \"They just left the camera rolling, and it took me probably 20 times to catch the matchbox because I have no depth perspective \\u2014 any time someone hands me something, I think it\\u2019s closer than it actually is. But I eventually did get it, and it was without giggling, so that\\u2019s good!\", \"Did you have discussions about your characters, or were you letting the dynamic play out as you went?\", \"We had a very, very deep discussion about our characters \\u2014 there\\u2019s so much going on that\\u2019s internalized, so it was about talking about all these things that are ambiguous in many ways in the script and the book.\", \"Like what?\", \"Kirsten [Dunst, who plays Peter\\u2019s widowed mother, Rose] and I had this idea \\u2014 it\\u2019s not in the book at all, and I have to be clear about that because it would change the whole story \\u2014 that Peter had actually killed his dad, too. It was our little secret that would just create a weird bond between them that would translate, but the audience wouldn\\u2019t know how to put their finger on it. But apparently some people put their finger directly on it!\", \"What do you make of the ending?\", \"Peter completely killed [Phil] with the anthrax. And he didn\\u2019t necessarily plan it out from A to Z, he\\u2019s one who really just acts upon the moment.\", \"Is he attracted to Phil?\", \"I\\u2019m still not sure if Peter started to feel his own intimate and sensual feelings toward Phil, or if that was all just a means to his own ends, but it does create a deeper layer that Peter was exploring his sexuality and maybe discovered himself in Phil and had to sacrifice his love for him.\", \"Do you think Peter\\u2019s mother knows he killed Phil?\", \"I think Rose knows and doesn\\u2019t want to ask. The same goes for Jesse Plemons\\u2019s character \\u2014 when he hears about anthrax, he knows Phil would never touch anything that has anthrax because he\\u2019s so well-learned in those areas. People don\\u2019t ask what they already know.\", \"\\u201cThe Power of the Dog\\u201d wasn\\u2019t the only film you shot close to home during the pandemic \\u2014 you also play the singer Jimmie Rodgers in Baz Luhrmann\\u2019s Elvis biopic, filmed in Australia and slated for release next summer. What was it like jumping from a western to the glitz of a Luhrmann film?\", \"My first day on the set, I was just supposed to be in the background of a scene, but then Baz Luhrmann said, \\u201cI have this great idea, I want you to stand on the table and sing.\\u201d And he gave me the option to say yes or no, but especially after working with Jane, I said yes. You\\u2019ve just got to not think about what others are going to think.\", \"What would be your dream role?\", \"I\\u2019m a big fan of surrealism, so it would be cool to play Salvador Dal\\u00ed \\u2014 I think I resemble him, in a way.\"]","href_hash":"adf02dd9546e11ec840eede6e8a4b73a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"adf02dd9546e11ec840eede6e8a4b73a"}},
