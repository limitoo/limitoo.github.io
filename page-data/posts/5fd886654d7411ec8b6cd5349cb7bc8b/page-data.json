St. Louis sued the NFL and Kroenke for the decision to move their Rams to Los Angeles in 2016. The lawsuit claimed that Kroenke and league officials lied about potential relocation plans as early as 2013, as well as the league ignoring relocation guidelines.\", \"In July, a circuit judge ordered that Kroenke and other NFL officials release financial records to determine if they had committed fraud. The league's lawyers called the request \\\"invasive\\\" but eventually turned them over after the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the decision.\", \"ESPN reported that the idea of St. Louis being selected for a new franchise was not seriously discussed. Distribution of funds, how much would be paid by Kroenke, and how much would be paid by other NFL team owners has not been announced.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939944/stan-kroenke.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The NFL and Rams owner Stan Kroenke have agreed to pay the city of St. Louis $790 million to settle a lawsuit filed after the team was relocated to Los Angeles.

The lawsuit sought more than $1 billion. It claimed the team's move cost the St. Louis region millions of dollars in amusement, ticket and earnings tax revenue.\", \"Then-owner Georgia Frontiere moved the Rams from Los Angeles in 1995 to her hometown of St. Louis, where they stayed for 21 seasons before Kroenke moved them back.\", \"Kroenke, a Missouri real estate developer who is married to an heir of the Walmart fortune, became a minority owner when the team first came to St. Louis. Frontiere died in 2008 and left the team to her children, who sold the Rams to Kroenke in 2010.\", \"It wasn't long after that that the Rams began pushing for hundreds of millions of dollars in improvements to the downtown domed stadium built with taxpayer money in the early 1990s to attract an NFL team.\", \"St. Louis interests initially proposed a more modest upgrade, then eventually proposed a new $1 billion stadium along the Mississippi River that would be funded jointly by taxpayers, the team and the NFL. The league and the team balked.\", \"Instead, Kroenke purchased land in Inglewood, California. SoFi Stadium opened in September of 2020 and is now home to both the Rams and the Los Angeles Chargers, who moved from San Diego in 2017.\", \"The NFL, Rams and Kroenke said the guidelines aren't iron-clad and the league had the right to approve a move that was clearly in the interest of the NFL and the owners of its 32 teams.\", \"Peter Joy, a professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the case should serve as a lesson for owners and the league to keep in mind if other team relocations are considered.\", \"\\\"Play by the rules,\\\" Joy said. \\\"Keep to the contract. Don't be deceptive.\\\"\", \"The NFL and Kroenke had also sought to move the trial out of St. Louis, citing \\\"undue influence\\\" over prospective jurors. But St. Louis Circuit Judge Christopher McGraugh denied the request in August, a decision later backed up by a Missouri appeals court.\", \"Kroenke and the NFL also sought unsuccessfully to have the case heard in arbitration rather than in court.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939936/rams-helmet.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The NFL and Rams owner Stan Kroenke have agreed to pay the city of St. Louis $790 million to settle a lawsuit filed after the team was relocated to Los Angeles.</div>\"]","href_hash":"5fd886654d7411ec8b6cd5349cb7bc8b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5fd886654d7411ec8b6cd5349cb7bc8b"}},
