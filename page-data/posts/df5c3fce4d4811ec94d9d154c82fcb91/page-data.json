This custardy butternut squash meets them all.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-24T17:07:02.000Z","content":"[\"LONDON \\u2014 With the festive season ahead of us, there\\u2019s a lot of feasting to be done. And, for it to be done properly \\u2014 enjoyed, and not just endured \\u2014 there are some dos and don\\u2019ts.\", \"Generally, I tend not to be so prescriptive. But, around this time of the year, I do find myself getting a little bit list-y, the result of both my enthusiasm for the season and the wisdom I\\u2019ve accumulated over the years (and years) of hosting and eating. And as anyone who prepares feasts knows, there\\u2019s a lot of planning, shopping, chopping and cooking to be done.\", \"To be useful, festive feast planning needs to be focused. As such, let\\u2019s stick to brunch.\", \"Here are some things you want from a festive brunch \\u2014 a recipe for brunch planning, if you like. As with all good recipes, you can take or leave what you like.\", \"You want the main to be special enough to be served with a \\u201cta-da!\\u201d but not steal the show entirely. It wants to be a little different, but your day shouldn\\u2019t peak before midafternoon. Think of pancakes: They\\u2019re something beyond the everyday but don\\u2019t totally ruin the mood (or the will to cook anything else that day).\", \"You want the meal to fill everyone enough so that they leave the kitchen (and you) alone for a few hours, but not so much that they\\u2019re done eating for the day. You want it to be seasonal and comforting, but not so much that people want to go straight back to bed afterward. This is why eggs feature so often at brunch: They\\u2019re perfect at fueling without weighing you down.\", \"You want it to be a balance of sweet and savory. Not so sweet that it leaves you reeling but sweet enough to ease people into the day and not feel too much like, well, lunch. But savory as well, since brunch is between breakfast and lunch. This is why strips of bacon or fried halloumi make so much sense with those pancakes \\u2014 to counter all the maple syrup sweetness.\", \"If those are a few things you do want from your festive brunch, here are a couple of things you don\\u2019t. Again, take it or leave it as you wish.\", \"You don\\u2019t want brunch to take hours of preparation beforehand and hours of clearing and washing up afterward. This is where one-pot (or pan or tray) dishes come so much into their own: eggy omelets or frittatas, or the eggs I\\u2019ve been braising in various shakshukas for as long as I\\u2019ve been making brunch.\", \"You don\\u2019t want to have to start cooking hours before brunch is ready. While keeping something on the stove or in the oven for four hours before supper isn\\u2019t an inconvenience, setting the alarm for 6 a.m. for a supposedly relaxed brunch is. Dishes where elements can be prepared the day before are always great here: batters that can be mixed early and left overnight; the tomato and red pepper base for the shakshuka, which can sit in the fridge for a day or two; fruit cooked down for a compote, ready to be swirled through thick yogurt.\", \"Everyone\\u2019s normal is different, I know, as are everyone\\u2019s traditions. But those are some of my rules, and this dish of five-spiced squash in cheesy custard delivers everything I want. And it\\u2019s the recipe I\\u2019ll be making for brunch this season: I\\u2019ll be roasting the squash a day ahead, ready for the custard to be made up, poured over and quickly baked that morning. I\\u2019ll be happy not to have used every pot and pan in my kitchen, and delighted to see guests gathering around for equal amounts of sweet squash and savory custard.\", \"Crucially, having done everything I need to do, I\\u2019ll be able to pull up a chair myself, to enjoy and be part of the meal. And being able to be relaxed and in the moment: Secretly, that\\u2019s the most important ingredient for a happy, festive meal.\", \"Recipe: Five-Spice Butternut Squash in Cheesy Custard\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
