Many have compared him to former U.S. President Donald Trump.\", \"Zemmour made the candidacy announcement with a pre-recorded video filled with far-right anti-immigration and anti-Islam sentiments. In the video, Zemmour, reading from notes and speaking into a microphone, said France is \\\"in the process of disappearing\\\" due to immigration.\", \"\\\"You feel that you are no longer in the country that you knew,\\\" Zemmour said. \\\"Your feel like foreigners in your own country. You are exiles, from the inside.\\\"\", \"The video's messaging was clear, showing mostly white men making honest livings as teachers and business leaders, while people of color were shown lining up for food and in tent cities filled with litter.\", \"Then Zemmour warned supporters to be ready for the campaign ahead, saying they could face backlash for supporting him.\", \"\\\"They will tell you that you are racist,\\\" he said. \\\"They will say the worst things about me.\\\"\", \"Current French President Emmanuel Macron's interior minister, Gerald Darmanin, called the video \\\"absolutely revolting.\\\"\", \"Macron is expected to run in the April election for a second term, though he has not announced his candidacy yet.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942531/eric-zemmour-far-right.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Far-right political talk-show star Eric Zemmour has officially entered the race for France's presidency, having already shaken it up with his anti-immigration, anti-Islam invective. Above, Zemmour acknowledges applauses as he arrived on stage during a meeting to promote his latest book \\\"La France n'a pas dit son dernier mot\\\" (France has not yet said its last word) in Versailles, west of Paris, Oct. 19.</div>\", \"The launch of Eric Zemmour's run for the presidency made official a candidacy that had been gathering steam for months before it then stumbled of late \\u2014 notably after the 63-year-old raised a middle finger at a woman who did likewise to him over the weekend.\", \"That flash of temper \\u2014 which Zemmour later acknowledged on Twitter was \\\"very inelegant\\\" \\u2014 cast fresh doubt on his temperament and electability.\", \"Name-dropping Joan of Arc, Napol\\u00e9on Bonaparte, Gen. Charles de Gaulle and others who shaped France's history, Zemmour announced his candidacy for the election in a pre-recorded video. The pose evoked imagery of radio addresses that De Gaulle famously delivered during World War II, urging France to rally against Nazi Germany.\", \"But the message Zemmour delivered was steeped in far-right thinking and language and far from that of the wartime leader who later served as president from 1959-1969.\", \"The people that Zemmour was shown meeting in the video and the campaign supporters and crowds filmed at his rallies were nearly all white. And the vast majority of people shown doing jobs in the video \\u2014 a mathematics teacher, a nuclear worker, cooks, suited business leaders, a butcher, a cattle farmer and others \\u2014 were nearly all white men.\", \"People of color, in contrast, were shown lining up for food handouts, pushing into a crowded train, milling around in a litter-strewn tent city and on a street corner and, in a scene at the start, seemingly taking part in a street deal. Other images showed Paris streets filled with Muslims kneeling down in prayer. Images of women protesting, some with breasts bared, were cut with violent scenes of people attacking police.\", \"\\\"It is no longer time to reform France but to save it,\\\" Zemmour said. \\\"That is why I have decided to stand in the presidential election.\\\"\", \"Zemmour joins a crowded spectrum of candidates, from far-left to far right. Polls have for months given Macron a sizeable but not impregnable lead over Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader roundly beaten by Macron in the presidential run-off in 2017. The 2022 campaign seemed likely to be a sequel of that battle before Zemmour started siphoning off Le Pen supporters.\", \"The campaign launch video left many questions unanswered about Zemmour's election platform. He didn't mention France's resurgent coronavirus pandemic, which has so far killed 119,000 people. He spoke of creating jobs, building France's industries and reducing its debts but didn't say how.\", \"The group SOS Racisme said Zemmour's video demonstrated \\\"pathological racism.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942537/eric-zemmour-french-president-candidate.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Eric Zemmour announced his French presidential candidacy in a video attempting to evoke imagery of Charles de Gaulle's famous WWII radio addresses.
