Then they had to interpret the object.\\\"\", \"When Ronald De Rose turned up with his glued-together 7.5kg rock, about the size of a rugby ball, Neall and his colleagues knew it was a meteorite.\", \"They sent it to a New Zealand expert, who said it was not.

We thought, 'Oh yeah, we'll see how hard this is.' It was a very unusual colour, being a black colour with a lot of metal flecks and specks.\", \"\\\"We thought there was nothing special about it.
