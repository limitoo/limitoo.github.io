What a run it\\u2019s been this past week, from Thanksgiving into Hanukkah, and Christmas looming with its ham and sugar cookies. You\\u2019d be excused if tonight all you want to do for dinner is eat celery stalks with peanut butter while listening to \\u201c(Not So Ancient) Yul-Tide Carols\\u201d on Spotify.\", \"It\\u2019s exhausting, what many of you have been laboring over for the last couple of weeks. Don\\u2019t beat yourself up if you feel depleted, in need of takeout food and a break from the kitchen. By the weekend you\\u2019ll be back up and running, making beef stew and cassoulet, baked ziti and blackout cake. I just know it.\", \"But if you\\u2019ve got a little bit of gas left in your tank? How about putting together the very best charcuterie board (above) for dinner tonight? Or you could make this terrific tofu and bok choy number, with ginger-tahini sauce. I also love these spicy cucumbers with yogurt, lemon and herbs, and this super-simple dinner of pineapple-marinated chicken breasts.\", \"Melissa Clark has an ace new recipe, for spicy shrimp cakes with chile-lime mayo. That could work. Yotam Ottolenghi has one, too, for five-spice butternut squash in cheesy custard. Likewise.\", \"I don\\u2019t know as you\\u2019re going to want to make alligator chili right now, but Christina Morales\\u2019s article in The Times this week, about Hoppy\\u2019s Corner Tiger Tailgate, a long-running gator-roasting tradition at Louisiana State University home football games, may intrigue you all the same. (The recipe works just great with any lean ground meat, by the way.) And you can prepare whatever you cook while drinking one of Rebekah Peppler\\u2019s new cocktail recipes, for mezcal fresca and bitterscotch.\", \"There are thousands and thousands more recipes waiting for you on New York Times Cooking. It\\u2019s true that you need a subscription to access them, and to use our features and tools. Subscriptions support our work and allow it to continue. I hope that if you haven\\u2019t already, you will subscribe today. (A subscription is also a terrific holiday gift!)\", \"We are standing by to render assistance if you find yourself jammed up in the kitchen or by our technology. Just drop us a line at cookingcare@nytimes.com. Someone will get back to you. And you can always write to me: foodeditor@nytimes.com. I\\u2019m not very helpful. But I read every letter sent.\", \"Now, it\\u2019s nothing to do with duck breasts, chestnuts or the flavor of anisette, but I\\u2019m enjoying \\u201cThe Impossible Art: Adventures in Opera,\\u201d by Matthew Aucoin. He\\u2019ll make me an opera nerd yet! (You can see his \\u201cEurydice\\u201d at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, through December 16.)\", \"Priya Krishna has a fascinating story in The Times this week about the devilish business of recipes and plagiarism.\", \"I\\u2019m late to it, but if you\\u2019re in need of mystery and beautiful language, I\\u2019ll put you on to Walter Mosley\\u2019s excellent \\u201cDown the River Unto the Sea.\\u201d\", \"Finally, here\\u2019s Stevie Nicks with Tom Petty, \\u201cStop Draggin\\u2019 My Heart Around,\\u201d live (but remastered) from her 1981 solo album, \\u201cBella Donna.\\u201d Look at our recipes the way Nicks does at Petty, and you\\u2019ll eat well for sure. I\\u2019ll be back on Friday.\"]","href_hash":"52b34a9152c511ec97b5e5199cedf8de"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"52b34a9152c511ec97b5e5199cedf8de"}},
