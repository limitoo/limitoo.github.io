Pressure can build up inside the bottles, causing the seal to pop off with significant force.\", \"Reckitt has received 70 reports of the cap or seal popping off the bottles, including 18 reports of minor injuries and one report of an eye injury that required medical attention.\", \"Consumers are urged not to open the bottles and instead return them for a refund. Already opened bottles are not part of the product recall as they would have released any pressure buildup and therefore no longer pose a hazard.\", \"The products were sold by retailers including Amazon, BJ's Wholesale Club, Costco, CVS, Kroger, Sam's Club, Walmart and www.schiffvitamins from May 2020 through February 2022 for between $18 and $33. \\u00a0\", \"The recall involves 63- and 75-count bottles of gummies sold in blueberry pomegranate, orange and assorted fruit flavors, and billed as helping support one's immune system.
