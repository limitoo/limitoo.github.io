The app has been under new pressure since Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager, leaked documents that showed the company was aware that Instagram makes teenage girls feel worse about themselves.\", \"Mr. Mosseri said in the blog post that Instagram was developing a slate of other tweaks for child safety. Its users will no longer be able to tag or mention teenagers who don\\u2019t follow them. The app is also releasing a feature for all its users in January that will allow them to delete their posts, comments and likes in bulk.\", \"It was not clear that Mr. Mosseri\\u2019s announcement would appease lawmakers. \\u201cMeta is attempting to shift attention from their mistakes by rolling out parental guides, use timers and content control features that consumers should have had all along,\\u201d said Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee. \\u201cBut my colleagues and I see right through what they are doing.\\u201d\", \"Instagram is among several major tech platforms that have explored changes to how children can use their products, in part because of new child safety guidelines in Britain. The app has said that it is considering asking some young users to go through a stricter process to prove how old they are, but has not yet added those features.\"]","href_hash":"c6fddade573711ec982303ecfb27ed99"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c6fddade573711ec982303ecfb27ed99"}},
