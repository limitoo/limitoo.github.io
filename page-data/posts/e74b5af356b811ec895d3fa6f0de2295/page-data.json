However, users on Chinese social networking sites are calling Evergrande's bluff.\", \"A video by The Wall Street Journal shows a number of posts bloggers on Weibo and WeChat saying that at some sites there actually has been \\\"no construction for months\\\" and in other areas where construction has begun there are \\\"there are fewer than 10 workers.\\\"\", \"On Monday, Evergrande shares dropped nearly 20 percent, closing at a value of just 23 cents. CNN reports that this stock valuation is the lowest total that the company has posted since 2009.\", \"Evergrande faces a net total of roughly $300 billion in liabilities. On Friday, the company warned that it could run out of money after its creditors demanded that it come up with $260 million in loan payments.\", \"With Evergrande's wealth tied up in property developments, a key to potentially reinvigorating its cash flow lies in its ability to finish and sell its undeveloped properties.
