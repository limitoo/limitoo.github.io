So, what it is a scarf with a big Velcro insert in it and then I Velcro it up and then I cable tie up.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/138257/four_col_boy_walking_socks.jpg?1644884016\\\" alt=\\\"A large statue of a child wearing rainbow socks.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nBoy Walking with rainbow socks attached. \\nPhoto: Supplied/Jo McDonald-Hooker\\n</div>\", \"McDonald-Hooker usually knits for trees, but for Pride month she's also targeted Ronnie Van Hout's Boy Walking sculpture in Potters Park.\", \"The boy is a 5.6-metre-tall landmark, and McDonald-Hooker says he was well-placed to get some rainbow socks.\", \"\\\"My ethos has always been to install trees, or the yarn bombing near, primary schools, or day-cares or something where like, the kids will see them and get you to joy. And so obviously, it's right by Potter's Park with the big water features.\\\"\", \"Closer to the centre of Auckland, the Yarn for Pride group has been knitting and crocheting biodegradable cotton attachments for Karangahape Road's bike parks.\", \"Bike Auckland's Macaila Pescud says it was a case of right time, right place.\", \"\\\"Karangahape Road has a history of being a place for the rainbow community, for our LGBT community. So, it's part of celebrating that history as well as the current community.\", \"\\\"Also, because we have this new cycleway, which is fantastic, and it's also bike month. Part of what we're doing is celebrating bike month at the same time.\\\"\", \"Pescud says they've been approached by locals and business owners while installing the art, and most of them are happy.\", \"\\\"It's been so positive, heaps of people are coming up to us and thanking us, which has felt really, really amazing. A lot of gratitude from the community, a lot of gratitude from people who bike as well, because it stops the bike parks from scratching their bikes, and a lot of gratitude from shop owners.\\\"\", \"The Karangahape Road Business Association counts itself among the fans.\", \"The Association's manager, Jamey Holloway, came across Pescud in the process of testing out the yarnbombing in December 2021 and quickly came on board.\", \"\\\"It's like gentle graffiti. It's beautiful. It warms up cold infrastructure. There's just nothing that's not gorgeous about it. Gentle and subversive. \\\"\", \"Pescud says it iss great to hear people calling it gentle graffiti, but unlike most graffiti found around town, it's legal and Karangahape Road's yarnbombers have a permit for their activities.\"]","href_hash":"5438181e8e2f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5438181e8e2f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
