The juror requested anonymity.\", \"The juror who was interviewed by the news outlets, including The Independent and Reuters, could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday.\", \"That two jurors identified themselves during deliberations as sexual abuse victims will almost certainly be highlighted by Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers in their post-trial motions, and the revelations could be the basis for revisiting Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s conviction, legal experts and former prosecutors said.\", \"Lawyers for Ms. Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

He said he would have answered such questions honestly, Reuters reported.\", \"Both he and the second juror made it to the next round of jury selection, appearing in court in November.
