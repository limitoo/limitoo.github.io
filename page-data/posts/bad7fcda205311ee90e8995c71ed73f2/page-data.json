He also bought a big house in East Tamaki.\", \"The case hinged on affidavits from \\\"four Chinese witnesses\\\" who provided banking information.\", \"\\\"Without the evidence the PRC provided and translated, the High Court would not have been satisfied of the significant criminal activity from which Mr Gong's assets were derived.\\\"\", \"Canada's Globe and Mail in 2018 reported that Gong claimed the evidence against him was \\\"coerced\\\" in China.\", \"\\\"Canada is accusing me and treating me unfairly ...

Those charges against him were later withdrawn but Gong's company pleaded guilty over the pyramid scheme and forgery, and was fined $CA1m and ordered to forfeit $CA15m.\", \"Canada's CTV News published a long report in April about the joint Ontario-China investigation, in which critics voiced concerns that too much trust was placed in China's justice system.\", \"Prior to the Ontario investigation, Gong was considered by many to be a success story.
