We want to be able to maximise using backhauling.\\\"\", \"WasteMINZ territorial authorities forum chair Sophie Mander said plastic waste was a significant environmental challenge for Aotearoa.\", \"\\\"Soft plastics regularly end up in landfills and waterways in our ocean and they litter our natural environment. So shifting away from hard to recycle single use plastics, including soft plastics, will definitely help us reduce waste, improve our recycling systems, and we'll protect the environment.\\\"\", \"Mander said soft plastics are still being found in kerbside collections - so they are going either to landfill or causing problems at recycling sorting facilities.\", \"A recent audit of the Queenstown Lakes District Council kerbside collection found just over 3 percent of the average recycling bin was soft plastics and 51 percent of all plastic in an average rubbish bin was non-recyclable plastic, or soft plastic.\", \"While there were a number of initiatives in the pipeline to reduce plastic waste - phasing out cotton buds and drinking straws - more focus was needed on soft plastics.\", \"\\\"At the moment here in the South Island we only have soft plastic recycling opportunities in a couple of the big cities, Dunedin and Christchurch. So for communities in some of the smaller urban areas of New Zealand, it's still really, really problematic.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/124120/four_col_kiri_hannifin.jpg?1623209883\\\" alt=\\\"Kiri Hannifin is the General Manager Corporate Affairs, Quality, Safety and Sustainability for Countdown Supermarkets. \\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nKiri Hannifin  \\nPhoto: Countdown\\n</div>\", \"Countdown is one of the scheme's main project partners, with collection bins in just over half of its stores (98 out of 185) around the country.\", \"Last year 100 tonnes of soft plastic was collected at Countdown stores, around 15m bags and wrappers.\", \"Countdown's director of sustainability Kiri Hannifin said when the recycling scheme stopped, customers were frustrated and disappointed and when it restarted, some stores were inundated with what people had stockpiled.\", \"\\\"People are in a good habit now of just bringing back their soft plastics or taking it out as they leave the store - taking their biscuit wrappers out and and sticking it straight in the bin.\", \"\\\"It's a good scheme and we welcome it growing but in a responsible way, because the last thing you want is it to end up in landfill, especially when Kiwis have done the right thing by recycling it.\\\"\", \"Hannifin said retailers had a responsibility to provide collection points in their communities.\", \"\\\"Obviously we are the conduit of a lot of soft plastic, lots of our products are packaged in soft plastic and similarly we are a supplier of food as well and some of our products are in soft plastics.\", \"\\\"So I think producers absolutely have a responsibility to support these schemes - in terms of paying levies and fees, which we do but also providing easy access to customers.\\\"\", \"But recycling aside the best thing consumers could do was avoid single use plastics wherever possible.\"]","href_hash":"6c3eb9eec1ed11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6c3eb9eec1ed11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
