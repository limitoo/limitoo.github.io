They include pain, fever and headaches, the hospital said.\", \"Since the heavily mutated Omicron variant was first detected in November, WHO data shows it has spread quickly and emerged in at least 128 countries. Case numbers have surged to all-time records, but hospitalisation and death rates are largely lower than at other phases in the pandemic.\", \"In Israel, daily infections have increased by more than 10 times over the past month. Severe illness has also climbed but at a far slower pace, according to Health Ministry data.\", \"Around 60 percent of the country's 9.4 million population are fully vaccinated.\", \"Some research has indicated that even if Omicron escapes antibodies, a key part of the immune system's second line of defence - its T-cells - are still highly effective at recognising and attacking the variant, preventing most infections from progressing to critical illness.\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"9d66a8046d8f11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9d66a8046d8f11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
