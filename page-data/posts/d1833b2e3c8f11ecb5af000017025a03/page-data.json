He said hockey needed to urgently consider a \\u201cPlan B\\u201d for the Olympics.\", \"His comments created a potentially embarrassing situation for hockey, Beijing 2022 organizers and, perhaps most important, the Chinese government. China\\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, views the Beijing Games as an opportunity for the country to showcase its relative success in taming the coronavirus and to demonstrate its emergence as a global power.\", \"Still, the risk of Chinese humiliation rose this fall when the International Olympic Committee announced that it had reached an agreement with the National Hockey League over the release of players for the Games, ensuring that China\\u2019s first-round opponents \\u2014 the United States, Canada and Germany \\u2014 would be stocked with some of the game\\u2019s best talent.\", \"Concerns about China\\u2019s performances are linked to a Chinese team that competes in Russia\\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League.
