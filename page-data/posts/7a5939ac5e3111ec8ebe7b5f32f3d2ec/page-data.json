Options for people who do not have a digital device or prefer not to use one were also being looked at, he said.\", \"\\\"Hira will also enable better clinical decision-making and allow services to be targeted in a way that improves equity for M\\u0101ori, Pacific peoples and vulnerable populations.\", \"\\\"Over time, Hira will give New Zealanders and their trusted providers access to an even broader range of data such as information about allergies, adverse reactions, shared care plans, and wider immunisation information and laboratory results.\\\"\", \"He said Hira would also allow people to nominate someone from their wh\\u0101nau to access their health information and would make it clear where the information is held and who is authorised to access it.\", \"Delivery of the Hira programme will be split into three stages through to the end of 2026.\", \"\\\"We've already built a solid platform for Hira through our work to implement key initiatives such as My Health Account and My Covid Record. By the end of tranche one in around mid-2024, we will have put in place many of the elements of Hira needed to lay the foundations for a digitally enabled health and disability system.\\\"\", \"In addition to the Hira programme, the Ministry has government approval to invest a further $87m over three years to support the replacement of ageing technology and to address digital capability deficits.\", \"It would work closely with district health boards to identify priority areas for the spending, Hunter said.\"]","href_hash":"7a5939ac5e3111ec8ebe7b5f32f3d2ec"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7a5939ac5e3111ec8ebe7b5f32f3d2ec"}},
