Why, he wondered, would the company want him to host \\u201cThe 33 \\u2153 Podcast,\\u201d its new show exploring individual works of classic albums, based on the Bloomsbury book series?\", \"Never mind that Prince Paul is considered a music nerd\\u2019s music nerd, best known for his influential studio wizardry with the hip-hop trio De La Soul. His eclectic, seemingly haphazard, career trajectory may not have made him an obvious choice for the show. Though he\\u2019s produced albums for Vernon Reid and MC Paul Barman, assembled the horrorcore group Gravediggaz and released albums of his own like \\u201cA Prince Among Thieves,\\u201d his music credits over the past decade and a half had slowed to a trickle. One of his more-prominent roles during this time: serving as the co-host of \\u201cEgo Trip\\u2019s The (White) Rapper Show,\\u201d a short-lived reality competition program on VH1.\", \"Prince Paul, born Paul Huston, didn\\u2019t bother asking the Spotify emissaries why they chose him. He said he didn\\u2019t want to ruin the moment with too much probing. But the first episode of the show, which debuted in September, illuminates the company\\u2019s thinking. Prince Paul welcomed Posdnuos from De La Soul to chat about \\u201cAja,\\u201d the 1977 album by Steely Dan, known for its meticulous, jazz-inflected rock compositions. What might seem at first like an odd pairing of host, guest and album is actually an inspired one.\", \"On \\u201c3 Feet High and Rising,\\u201d De La Soul\\u2019s debut album that Prince Paul produced, the band sampled the duo\\u2019s song \\u201cPeg,\\u201d not a particularly common, or welcome, move in the rap world in 1989. As the two men banter and reminisce, listeners get a sense of Steely Dan\\u2019s influence on De La Soul and how sampling \\u201cPeg\\u201d made perfect sense for the album they were creating.\", \"\\u201cWhat made you pick that song in particular, especially for our first album?\\u201d Prince Paul asked.\", \"\\u201cJust as a single it was a song that we heard and we felt, and it felt good, and it felt happy,\\u201d Posdnuos said, remembering how \\u201cPeg\\u201d just clicked for him when he first heard it as an 8-year-old in the Bronx. \\u201cBut it was also very rhythmic, like the bass driving. It felt like an R&B record, to be quite honest. You could easily connect to it.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cDid it feel dated or anything at the time?\\u201d Prince Paul asked in a follow-up question.\", \"\\u201cNot at all,\\u201d Posdnuos said. \\u201cIt felt like a classic joint; it\\u2019s timeless. I look at that song as a timeless record to now be applied to what we were doing. I didn\\u2019t look at it as an older record to now breathe some life into it.\\u201d\", \"\\u201c33 \\u2153\\u201d is the latest music-focused production from Spotify, joining the likes of \\u201c\\u201cBlack Girl Songbook\\u201d and \\u201cNo Skips with Jinx and Shea\\u201d and fitting snugly into Spotify\\u2019s larger podcast ambitions. Other episodes in the 12-episode season feature an eclectic mix of albums and guests including Janet Jackson\\u2019s \\u201cVelvet Rope\\u201d and the singer-songwriter Victoria Mon\\u00e9t, David Bowie\\u2019s \\u201cLow\\u201d and the rapper Danny Brown, and Metallica\\u2019s \\u201cMetallica\\u201d (best known as the Black Album) and the Hole drummer Patty Schemel.\", \"Deciding which albums to feature \\u2014 there are more than 150 books in the Bloomsbury series \\u2014 was not \\u201csuper calculated,\\u201d said Yasi Salek, the show\\u2019s producer. Instead, the focus is on \\u201cwhat would be really fun to bring to life.\\u201d Choosing the guests, however, involved a more thoughtful process. Salek said she looked for guests who knew the artist, were involved in the making of the project or have talked about the album\\u2019s influence on them. In the \\u201cVelvet Rope\\u201d episode, Mon\\u00e9t tells Prince Paul how Jackson was a role model for her. \\u201cI needed to see that as a young girl just to be able to look at her and see myself,\\u201d she said.\", \"In keeping with his uncalculated approach to his career, Prince Paul is hands off when it comes to the decision-making process, saying he\\u2019s open to whatever is sent his way. Which helps explain the riotous, and expletive-filled, exploration of Guns N\\u2019 Roses\\u2019 \\u201cUse Your Illusion\\u201d I & II with Sebastian Bach of Skid Row and Riki Rachtman, co-owner of the Hollywood nightclub The Cathouse (a magnet for heavy metal bands till its closing in 1993). It\\u2019s a record that doesn\\u2019t quite fall in Prince Paul\\u2019s wheelhouse \\u2014 he opens the episode by letting the audience know that his \\u201cknowledge of metal and rock are limited\\u201d \\u2014 but the choice underscores his willingness to be a student.\", \"Hosting the show, Prince Paul said, is \\u201cforcing me to learn classic records and appreciate music all over again.\\u201d\", \"That willingness to try something new seems to be the fuel that has propelled him to each juncture in his career \\u2014 whether that\\u2019s producing comedy albums for Chris Rock or a hip-hop children\\u2019s concept album about kid dinosaurs, serving as one half of the genre-bending duo Handsome Boy Modeling School or composing the score for last year\\u2019s six-part documentary \\u201cWho Killed Malcolm X?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cEverybody wants to do whatever\\u2019s cool,\\u201d Prince Paul said.

And that\\u2019s, I think, the most important thing.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s something to be said about going out there and not knowing where this path will take you,\\u201d he added.\", \"////\"]","href_hash":"3439d0164c8511ecb592cb35989e27db"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3439d0164c8511ecb592cb35989e27db"}},
