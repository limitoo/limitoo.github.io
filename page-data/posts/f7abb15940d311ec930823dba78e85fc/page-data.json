The signal, created by the Canadian Women\\u2019s Foundation for people to indicate that they are at risk of abuse and need help, has spread largely through TikTok in the past year.\", \"The motorist who spotted the signal called 911 and conveyed a suspicion that the girl was in trouble because she was using the hand gesture. Though the dispatcher and officers were unfamiliar with the signal, sheriff\\u2019s deputies pulled the car over to investigate, and learned that the girl\\u2019s parents had reported her missing two days earlier.\", \"Sheriff\\u2019s deputies arrested the driver, James Herbert Brick, 61, of Cherokee, N.C., and charged him with unlawful imprisonment. Mr. Brick, who the sheriff\\u2019s office said had pornographic images of a child on his phone, also faces a child pornography charge.\", \"The girl and Mr. Brick are \\u201cacquaintances\\u201d but are not related, said Gilbert Acciardo, public affairs officer for the Laurel County Sheriff\\u2019s Office. The girl told investigators that she had traveled with Mr. Brick through North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and Ohio, where he had family. He left the family after they learned that the girl was a minor and that she had been reported missing by her family. She said she began trying to get motorists\\u2019 attention as they traveled south from Ohio.\", \"It was not clear how many people saw the girl\\u2019s hand signal, Officer Acciardo said. But when the deputies pulled the car over, the girl made the signal toward them, he said.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think any of us realized what that was,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut we certainly do now.\\u201d\", \"Investigators believe Mr. Brick thought she was simply waving at other cars and didn\\u2019t attempt to stop her, Officer Acciardo said. He praised the girl for using the gesture, which he said would be a useful tool for victims if it were universally known.\", \"\\u201cThis is probably the best thing I\\u2019ve seen come along in the 48 years I\\u2019ve been a patrol officer,\\u201d he said.\", \"Millions of people have seen videos featuring the signal on TikTok and YouTube, while organizations including the World Bank and the Women\\u2019s Funding Network have promoted it since April 2020. It began as a Covid-era lifeline for women in abusive relationships, intended to be used on video calls as a signal that others should check in on them.\", \"The Canadian Women\\u2019s Foundation advises that anyone who sees the signal should not necessarily immediately call the authorities, but should instead reach out safely, if possible, to the person who used it. The hand movements do not refer to anything in American Sign Language, so the signal relies on general awareness to be effective.\"]","href_hash":"f7abb15940d311ec930823dba78e85fc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f7abb15940d311ec930823dba78e85fc"}},
