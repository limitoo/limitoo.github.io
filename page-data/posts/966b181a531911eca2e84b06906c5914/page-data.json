Officials said that he left his name and telephone number in some messages, according to The Associated Press. He left messages for three senators and three representatives, the Department of Justice reported.\", \"In one message, Winegar allegedly said, \\\"I got some advice for you. Here's the advice, Donald Trump is your president. If you don't get behind him, we're going to hang you until you die.\\\"\", \"U.S. Capitol Police officers first tried to interview Winegar on Dec. 20, 2020 but were refused. Winegar flew to Brazil the next day alone before authorities could come back with warrants. He was arrested on Jan. 11, 2021, when he returned to the United States.\", \"\\\"And it really, really, it boils down to two camps. You either support our president, support liberty, and this global f*** this h**o, uh, vaccination Jewish agenda, or you're not. In which case we're going to f***ing kill you.

Farley. \\\"While all citizens are free to express their political opinions, it is unlawful to threaten to commit acts of violence against members of Congress or members of the state legislature.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943729/ryder-winegar-threats-congress-sentence.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Ryder Winegar was given a 33-month sentence along with a $15,000 fine after he pleaded guilty to threatening six members of Congress over not supporting former President Donald Trump.
