In another image, a woman in a green bikini and thigh-high patent-leather boots clutches a wall as if suddenly realizing she\\u2019s had one too many. A video features a couple of Kardashian-Jenners palpating a wall illuminated by blinking neon tube lights. A woman straddles her open hatchback while wrapped in string.\", \"People have spent a very long time attacking these types of glamorous images for being unrealistic \\u2014 for altering, enhancing and modifying everything down to the models\\u2019 physiology. But a photo comparison showing how the subject\\u2019s waist was artificially cinched still works from the assumption that these images are trying to get away with subtly misrepresenting the real world. For years, the Australian comedian and actress Celeste Barber has focused on something different: Rather than show how these lavishly stylized images distort reality, she shows how crazy it is to think they\\u2019re depicting any kind of reality, any realm of normal human behavior, at all.\", \"She does this by guilelessly emulating the images around her, as though she fails to perceive their strangeness, as though they were the most natural thing in the world. In the version of that Kardashian video Barber posted to Instagram, she feels her way around a hallway in a skintight jumpsuit as someone flicks the lights awkwardly on and off. In her take on a video of Britney Spears writhing beside the ocean in a bikini, Barber ends up tossed around by waves. She posts a video of Gwyneth Paltrow waking up \\u201cglowy,\\u201d thanks to her skin-care routine, then one of herself waking up in yesterday\\u2019s makeup. Barber looks ridiculous \\u2014 not because she is failing to live up to an image, but because it is so ludicrous to even try. Her persona is that of an ordinary woman with no internalized shame about failing to satisfy an artificial beauty standard \\u2014 someone who sees a gorgeous woman in a bikini and boots clutching a wall and simply decides to try it for herself.\", \"This shtick, which Barber calls \\u201cChallenge Accepted,\\u201d began in 2015 \\u201cas a fun experiment to see what it would look like for an average person to photograph herself doing rich-people things.\\u201d Six years later, it has spawned a book and a stand-up show. Barber has 8.4 million followers on Instagram and has won a Webby award, presented by Naomi Watts, who praised Barber for her empowering self-love. This might seem a funny thing to say about a woman who is constantly flailing around in bikinis trying to look as unsexy as possible. But it makes some sense in the context of Instagram, where it\\u2019s not uncommon to see a gorgeous woman post a photo of herself without makeup, revealing the vaguest hint of a roll of fat, followed by a multiparagraph essay on how important it is to own one\\u2019s imperfections \\u2014 an obvious humblebrag. Barber, though, revels in her realness. The more bizarre, awkward or hilarious she makes herself look, the better she comes off. It\\u2019s always the original image that ends up seeming ridiculous and grotesque, not her.\", \"In her book \\u201cThe End of Love,\\u201d an analysis of how avoiding love has become a hallmark of contemporary relationships, the sociologist Eva Illouz writes that \\u201cthe economic valuation of the female body was made possible by the fact that it was transformed into a tradable visual unit.\\u201d In the 20th century, she argues, sexual-liberation movements were subsumed into the consumer economy, and \\u201cnew norms of attractiveness\\u201d \\u2014 a \\u201cmixture of clothing styles, allure and bodily shape\\u201d \\u2014 were codified into images that could be circulated with a value of their own, one independent of the identity or status of the women pictured.\", \"Social media has only normalized making a commodity-spectacle of oneself, dutifully reproducing \\u201csexiness,\\u201d which Illouz defines as \\u201cthe result of new ideologies of sexuality as a commodity form and of the self as image.\\u201d Young people, especially young women, have a breezy facility with creating highly artificial images of themselves for online consumption, posing and lighting themselves as if advertising something \\u2014 and, often, happily self-objectifying, enjoying the satisfactions of making their lives, and themselves, look like luxury items.\", \"Barber\\u2019s Instagram account began as a catalog of Barber trying to do \\u201crich-people things,\\u201d but in fact these kinds of images are meant not only for rich people. They are intended to transcend class \\u2014 not only to reposition luxury goods as consumer items everyone might aspire to have, but to position women, or a very narrow subset of women, as a stand-in for the idea of women in the marketplace. Each represents a fantastical feminine ideal and its punishing relationship to the world. Perhaps it would be more accurate to think of Barber\\u2019s project as a catalog of \\u201ccapitalist things,\\u201d or \\u201clady things,\\u201d or a combination of both \\u2014 the bourgeois \\u201clady\\u201d being, after all, the human embodiment of capitalism.\", \"In her \\u201cChallenge Accepted\\u201d comedy show, Barber observes that \\u201cin the land of being a lady, it seems that if you look a certain way \\u2014 if you are really tall, a bird, and slim, you know, all arms and legs; think praying mantis, if you will\\u201d \\u2014 if you are \\u201can excellent, gorgeous praying-mantis woman, and you want to post naked photos of yourself, you, my friend, you are empowering. That is empowering to women. Thank you. Now if you are not so praying mantis, and a little more armadillo, and you also want to post naked photos of yourself \\u2014 not empowering to women. It is, however, very brave\\u201d \\u2014 the implication being that, in this context, \\u201cbrave\\u201d is code for \\u201cfat.\\u201d\", \"Barber isn\\u2019t fat, though she does play up the ways in which her body fails to conform to \\u201cthe look\\u201d; this is how she reveals its oppressive primacy, and the fact that buying things cannot turn you into the person modeling them. Is it \\u201cbrave\\u201d for her to display her body emerging unclad from a car (not a Rolls-Royce), or writhing on the sand in a bikini, or imitating a French dancer by hanging from her hair in a garage in her undergarments? Is it merely brave to do so while looking like a person who does not have the B.M.I. of a pencil? Is it brave simply to not be hot enough to shut down the critical faculties that lead you to notice that what she is doing is dumb and unnatural and hilarious, and that there might be something very wrong with us that we find it so persuasive?\", \"A decade ago, it seemed like a common joke involved women being self-effacing about not living up to these images of glamour, casting their ordinariness as a kind of relatable failure. Barber\\u2019s dutiful re-enactments feel so cathartic because she has found a simple, elegant way to turn that joke around. She does not scan as a person failing to live up to a look. You\\u2019re moved instead to think about the image itself. What is it supposed to communicate? What is it supposed to sell? Why do we engage with it as if it has so much relevance to the real world? Why weren\\u2019t we laughing before?\"]","href_hash":"7964eb483c8711ecbccc000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7964eb483c8711ecbccc000017025a03"}},
