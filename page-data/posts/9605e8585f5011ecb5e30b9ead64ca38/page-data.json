He oversees all of the \\u201cSesame Street\\u201d social media accounts (eight on Facebook, nine on Twitter and one on Instagram), each of which mirrors the characters on the long-running children\\u2019s program and shares messages that are aligned with the show\\u2019s mission of making viewers smarter and kinder.\", \"\\u201cWe knew our character accounts were powerful voices to educate,\\u201d Mr. Bisman said. But deciding when and how to leverage each one involves careful consideration.\", \"It made sense for Big Bird to talk about getting the Covid vaccine, for instance, because he has \\u201ca lot of joy but a bit of anxiousness,\\u201d Mr. Bisman said. Elmo also tweeted about vaccination, but not from personal experience. (He\\u2019s perpetually 3 and a half years old \\u2014 too young to be eligible, but apparently old enough to go skiing with Lil Nas X.) Bert was able to post about casting a vote in the 2020 presidential election as he\\u2019s a bit older. Plus, Mr. Bisman said, he seems like someone committed to civic duty.\", \"These sorts of extrapolations about characters and their motivations are no longer limited to the realm of writers\\u2019 rooms and social strategy meetings. Now just about everyone talks about fictional beings as if they were living, breathing entities who walk \\u2014 and post \\u2014 among us. Throughout the pandemic, fans began to engage more in what are known as parasocial relationships with the stars of their favorite shows, as screen time spiked and viewers sought out comfort TV. On social media, characters with blue checks who post regularly have only fueled that behavior.\", \"Mr. Bisman said the \\u201cSesame Street\\u201d accounts are focused on \\u201cleveraging the love and nostalgia\\u201d that people have for the show, which began airing in 1969 and has been a part of three generations\\u2019 lives. (Meanwhile, the oldest of the accounts have been around for a decade.) \\u201cWe think about building relationships,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbecause that\\u2019s what\\u2019s expected of any brand out in the world today.\\u201d\", \"The \\u201cGossip Girl\\u201d reboot on HBO Max, which debuted this summer, has a similar aim: Based on a show that wrapped nearly 10 years ago, the series had a built-in audience of former fans who still reference scenes in their own social media posts, and it also has a new generation of viewers to reach.\", \"While the original show ended just before the explosion of social media, the writers, executive producers and directors agreed it would play a much bigger part in the reboot \\u2014 not just in the show\\u2019s plot, but also as an extension of it. The official \\u201cGossip Girl\\u201d social media accounts, as well as the characters\\u2019 own, were a way to \\u201creward\\u201d viewers \\u201cfor staying in that world,\\u201d said Anthony Cain, the director of social for HBO Max.\", \"Five people at HBO Max are dedicated to running the \\u201cGossip Girl\\u201d social accounts, along with several employees at Ralph, an external creative agency. The posts closely follow the story line of each character.\", \"\\u201cGossip Girl\\u201d also has a team that makes sure the characters\\u2019 phone screens appear realistic in each episode. This includes Instagram feeds, tweets and Venmo transactions \\u2014 all of which are made using prototyping software \\u2014 as well as a Google Sheet with tips sent to the Gossip Girl account on the show (hundreds of them, written by Matthew K. Begbie, a script coordinator on the show, and Eleanor Laurence, a scripted social media supervisor).\", \"The characters have an active presence on other social networks, too. Akeno \\u201cAki\\u201d Menzies, an introverted film buff, has an account on the movie-reviewing site Letterboxd, run by Mr. Begbie, Joshua Safran, the \\u201cGossip Girl\\u201d showrunner, and Eric Eidelstein, a writer on the show. (Shortly after the movie \\u201cThe Humans\\u201d came out, Aki\\u2019s account on Letterboxd published a review of the film that referenced the Thanksgiving episode of \\u201cGossip Girl,\\u201d blending real and fictional universes.)\", \"Two other characters, Audrey Hope and Zoya Lott, are on Goodreads. The fanfare over Audrey\\u2019s account surprised Mr. Begbie; while there was \\u201cclamor,\\u201d as he put it, from fans over what she was reading, he didn\\u2019t expect it to become, at one point, the most-followed account on Goodreads (it\\u2019s currently No. 17). Zoya\\u2019s account came after fans started asking for it.\", \"Mr. Begbie said that running the accounts feels like \\u201can extended game of playing pretend.\\u201d Fans play along too, addressing the accounts by the characters\\u2019 names when sending private messages to recommend films and books. \\u201cConsumers are feeling these accounts are authentic,\\u201d Mr. Cain said. He added: \\u201cThey love this world, they want to stay in this world.\\u201d\", \"Peter B. Gregg, an associate professor of emerging media at the University of St. Thomas, echoed that point. \\u201cOur minds don\\u2019t treat parasocial contact as that different from interpersonal contact,\\u201d Dr. Gregg said. As these shows give us \\u201ca special window into their world,\\u201d he said, viewers come to feel like they know the characters.\", \"\\u201cWe all know these characters aren\\u2019t real,\\u201d Mr. Bisman said. But even Ted Lasso, whose Twitter account is just as unrealistically upbeat as his character on the Apple+ show, has fans thanking him for the inspirational quotes.\", \"\\u201cGetting people to form parasocial relationships with characters is a good way to get them to return to the content,\\u201d Dr. Gregg said. Ahead of Season 2, the \\u201cGossip Girl\\u201d team plans to reveal a few more tricks. But, Mr. Begbie said, referring to one of the show\\u2019s heartthrobs, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think we\\u2019ll see Max on Scruff anytime soon.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9605e8585f5011ecb5e30b9ead64ca38"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9605e8585f5011ecb5e30b9ead64ca38"}},
