In Kyiv on Wednesday, Blinken will meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian leaders.\\u00a0\", \"From there, he will travel to Berlin, where he will consult with German, French and British counterparts. And on Friday he is scheduled to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva.\\u00a0\", \"Blinken's travel follows a trip to Kyiv last Wednesday by CIA Director Wiliam Burns, who met with intelligence counterparts and spoke with President Zelenskyy about \\\"assessments of risk\\\" to Ukraine, according to a U.S. official. \\u00a0\", \"A senior state department official said Tuesday that Russia's willingness to continue talks revived what had been diminishing hopes that a military invasion could be forestalled.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"[T]he fact that Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Lavrov agreed to meet on Friday in Geneva suggests that perhaps diplomacy is not dead,\\\" the official said.\", \"\\\"\\\"Russia has two choices: diplomacy and de-escalation, or escalation and massive consequences,\\\" the official continued. \\\"The United States remains committed to diplomacy and believes it is the best and most responsible way forward.\\\"\", \"Russia has already amassed an estimated 100,000 troops near its borders with Ukraine and has started positioning defense units in Belarus to the north of Ukraine for joint exercises.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We're now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack on Ukraine,\\\" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. \\\"I would say that's more stark than we have been.\\\"\", \"In a call with reporters, the senior State Department official also described the movement of Russian forces into Belarus as \\\"neither an exercise nor normal troop movement,\\\" and \\\"a show of strength designed to cause or give false pretext for a crisis as Russia plans for a possible invasion.\\\"\", \"\\\"The fact that we're seeing this movement of forces into Belarus clearly gives the Russians another approach, should they decide to take further military action against Ukraine,\\\" the official said.\", \"CBS News reported Friday that Ukrainian officials are concerned Russia might use alternative methods of attack, including potentially a staged provocation originating from within neighboring Belarus or another Russia-friendly territory in the region, as a predicate to invade Ukraine.\\u00a0\", \"Another senior State Department official warned Tuesday that Russia is preying on Belarus's ongoing instability, as well as on what the official described as President Alexander Lukashenka's \\\"self-inflicted vulnerability\\\". \\u00a0\", \"\\\"Lukashenka has relied more and more on Russia for all kinds of support, and we know that Putin doesn't give that support for free.
