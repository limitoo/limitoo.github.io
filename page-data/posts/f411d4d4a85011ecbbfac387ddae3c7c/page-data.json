When they arrived, the chaos they left behind was, for a moment, replaced with compassion \\u2026 a serving of pizza.\\u00a0 \", \"But their journey was just beginning. They were soon boarding a bus going deeper into Poland, where they hope to catch another bus that would take them to Germany. \", \"Andreeeva said that 11-year-old Ania and 6-year-old Irina have been spared the grim details, for the most part. \\\"I tried protecting my children,\\\" she said. \\\"I am not giving them all information that I have.\\\"\", \"UNICEF estimates at least one million of the refugees are children; the rest are women and the elderly \\u2013 a human catastrophe on a scale that Europe hasn't seen since World War II.\", \"\\\"Don't believe that this will be over quickly,\\\" said David Miliband, the president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee.\", \"Correspondent Lee Cowan asked, \\\"As bad as this is, over three million people so far, how bad do you think it might get?\\\"\", \"\\\"However much we hope for the best, we should plan for the worst,\\\" Miliband replied. \\\"And planning for the worst means figures of five or even seven, or in some estimates 10 million people, leaving the country.\\\"\", \"Those kinds of dire predictions have already triggered a never-before-used directive that allows refugees to stay and work in EU countries for up to three years. \\\"The approach was, let people in first, do the paperwork second,\\\" Miliband said. \\\"And that's a very significant reaction, and it speaks to the scales of the crisis.\\\"\", \"But Miliband said the exit out of Ukraine is only part of the problem: \\\"We have to remember that for every person who makes it out of Ukraine, there are ten still inside Ukraine.\\\"\", \"Russia's cruel indifference to providing humanitarian corridors have left those inside the country virtually cut off.

What he has succeeded in doing, however, is testing the limits of human cruelty. \", \"Turnley said, \\\"This moment feels very dark.
