The shooting suspect, Ethan Crumbley, 15, has been charged with murder and terrorism, and his parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, have been charged with involuntary manslaughter. Each of them has pleaded not guilty.\", \"In addition to releasing information about an investigation, Tim Throne, the district superintendent, revealed details in his letter about what happened before the shootings, including two meetings school officials had with Ethan Crumbley, the first time that the district had given its version of events.\", \"Here are five questions the school addressed in the letter.\", \"Mr. Throne said the outside party would examine any communication the school has received as well as \\u201cany and all interaction\\u201d Ethan Crumbley had with staff and students. Mr. Throne also said the district plans to ask an independent security consultant to review the district\\u2019s safety practices and procedures.\", \"On Nov. 29, Mr. Throne wrote, a teacher saw Mr. Crumbley viewing images of bullets on his cellphone during class. A counselor and a staff member met with him, and he indicated that shooting sports were a family hobby, the letter said. The school tried to contact Ms. Crumbley but did not hear back right away. The next day, Mr. Crumbley\\u2019s parents confirmed his account, the letter said.\", \"On the morning of Nov. 30, the day of the shootings, a teacher observed drawings by Mr. Crumbley that raised concerns. Karen D. McDonald, the prosecutor in Oakland Country, Mich., has said that the drawing featured images of a gun, a person who had been shot, a laughing emoji and the words, \\u201cBlood everywhere,\\u201d and, \\u201cThe thoughts won\\u2019t stop. Help me.\\u201d\", \"The teacher, Mr. Throne said, notified school counselors and the dean of students. Mr. Crumbley was immediately removed from the classroom and taken to the guidance counselor\\u2019s office, where he claimed the drawing was part of a video game he was designing, Mr. Throne said.\", \"According to the letter, the school had difficulty reaching Mr. Crumbley\\u2019s parents, and he remained in the office for an hour and a half before they arrived. During that time, school officials observed Mr. Crumbley and spoke with him.\", \"After his parents arrived, school officials asked \\u201cspecific probing questions\\u201d regarding Mr. Crumbley\\u2019s potential to harm others or himself, Mr. Throne said. Mr. Crumbley\\u2019s answers, which were confirmed by his parents, led counselors to conclude that he did not intend to hurt anyone, the superintendent said.\", \"\\u201cAt no time did counselors believe the student might harm others based on his behavior, responses and demeanor, which appeared calm,\\u201d wrote Mr. Throne, referring to both meetings.\", \"Counseling was recommended for Mr. Crumbley, and his parents were told they had 48 hours to seek counseling for their child or the school would contact Children\\u2019s Protective Services, Mr. Throne wrote.\", \"\\u201cWhen the parents were asked to take their son home for the day,\\u201d he wrote, \\u201cthey flatly refused and left without their son, apparently to return to work.\\u201d\", \"Because their son had no previous disciplinary infractions, \\u201cthe decision was made he would be returned to the classroom rather than sent home to an empty house.\\u201d\", \"According to the letter, the decisions related to both meetings remained at the guidance counselor level and were never elevated to the principal\\u2019s or assistant principal\\u2019s offices. The counselors made judgments based on their training and clinical experience, Mr. Throne said, \\u201cand did not have all the facts we now know.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Throne said that whether Mr. Crumbley had a firearm in his backpack during the meeting \\u201chas not been confirmed by law enforcement at this time nor by our investigation at this time.\\u201d But Mr. Throne wrote that, \\u201cThe student\\u2019s parents never advised the school district that he had direct access to a firearm or that they had recently purchased a firearm for him.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b64a7412563e11ec8b8737e449b7a285"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b64a7412563e11ec8b8737e449b7a285"}},
