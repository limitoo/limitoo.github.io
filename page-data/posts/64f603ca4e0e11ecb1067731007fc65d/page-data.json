I don\\u2019t generally write to you on Thursdays, but I thought I\\u2019d make an exception today on account of how it\\u2019s Thanksgiving and some of you may be freaking out \\u2014 all the cooking; all the people; all of [gestures] this. I\\u2019m here to tell you: Everything\\u2019s going to be all right.\", \"Is your turkey (above) in the oven or bound for it soon? Remember that it\\u2019ll cook at about 13 minutes per pound at 350 degrees if the bird is unstuffed, and at about 15 minutes a pound if it\\u2019s stuffed. (I don\\u2019t like stuffing the turkey. It slows things down and doesn\\u2019t yield enough dressing for guests.)\", \"Is the turkey browning too quickly? (That\\u2019ll happen, especially if you start it off in a hot oven of 425 degrees to seize its skin, and back off to 350 after 30 minutes or so.) Loosely tent its top with aluminum foil, and you\\u2019ll be good to go.\", \"Baste every 45 minutes or so, or whenever you remember to. It\\u2019s not a science.\", \"Well, some of the cooking is. The turkey is \\u201cdone\\u201d when its internal temperature, measured at the fleshy part of the thigh with an instant-read thermometer, is 165 degrees. The United States Department of Agriculture would like you to remove the bird from the oven at that precise temperature, knowing that the temperature will continue to rise as the turkey rests, to around 180 degrees after a half-hour or 45 minutes. I generally pull my bird at 160 degrees, though, and serve it in the neighborhood of 170 after 45 minutes or an hour of rest.\", \"Here\\u2019s how to make gravy while that\\u2019s happening. (If you\\u2019re spooning off fat from your roasting pan, you can use some of it to moisten your stuffing.) Here\\u2019s how to carve the bird. And here\\u2019s my best tip for keeping your turkey warm on a platter when you serve it: Leave a pot of slowly simmering turkey or chicken stock on your stovetop throughout the day (I actually start with chicken stock, add the turkey neck to it right away, and it\\u2019s turkey stock by the time I need it), and ladle some of it over your sliced meat just before serving.\", \"As for the rest, you\\u2019ve got it, I know: sides and cranberry sauce; cocktails and pies. (Not to mention desserts that are not pie.) And are you cooking for one? Our Vaughn Vreeland made a lovely video about doing so.\", \"You\\u2019ll maybe note that I haven\\u2019t mentioned appetizers yet. That\\u2019s because I don\\u2019t approve of appetizers at Thanksgiving. I don\\u2019t rise in darkness to cook for hours so that you can eat a half-pound of nuts before dinner and refuse seconds. But wow, this new Gabrielle Hamilton recipe for fried saltines with Cheddar and onions? She makes a very strong case for bringing those into the holiday rotation. And you probably have the ingredients in your pantry already.\", \"Much more guidance for managing your Thanksgiving meal are waiting for you on New York Times Cooking, at least once you\\u2019ve secured a subscription to the site and apps. I hope you have. Subscriptions support our work. And if you haven\\u2019t gotten one yet, I hope you will subscribe today. Thank you.\", \"Drop us a line if you\\u2019re in a jam. We\\u2019ll be working until 5 p.m. Eastern time: cookingcare@nytimes.com.\", \"Mostly, have fun. Keep cool. And remember: Radical empathy is your best Thanksgiving friend. I\\u2019ll be back tomorrow with much to say about leftovers.\"]","href_hash":"64f603ca4e0e11ecb1067731007fc65d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"64f603ca4e0e11ecb1067731007fc65d"}},
