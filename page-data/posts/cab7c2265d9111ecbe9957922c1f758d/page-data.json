But it is in a dry spell.\", \"This year marked its second winless season in a row, something it has not experienced since 1992 and 1993. While Mercedes and Red Bull have become Formula 1\\u2019s dominant teams, Ferrari has found itself playing catch-up.\", \"But even without winning, it has been a positive year for Ferrari. The team was crestfallen in 2020 after struggling to finish sixth in the championship, largely because of an underperforming engine. The team has recovered to third place this year.\", \"\\u201cThe greatest sign of the reconstruction is that even in the darkest moments of last year, the team stayed very united,\\u201d said Laurent Mekies, the team\\u2019s sporting director.\", \"\\u201cWe know we were in front of a huge task to turn things around and to get out of the situation we were in. But we\\u2019ve seen progress. It gave confidence.\\u201d\", \"To cut costs and help manage the financial impact of the pandemic, teams were limited on the improvements they could make to their cars for 2021. But Ferrari managed to fix its engine problems before the new season, allowing it to improve its results.\", \"Mekies said Ferrari had \\u201cvery, very strong team spirit that comes from having gone through the huge difficulty of last year\\u201d and noted the determination of the team\\u2019s drivers, Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Carlos Sainz Jr. of Spain.\", \"They struck up a friendship as teammates. They earned the nickname C\\u00b2, Carlos being the Spanish version of Charles, and became obsessed with playing chess against each other. \\u201cWe got quite crazy with it,\\u201d Leclerc said.\", \"Leclerc took pole position for his home race in Monaco in May, but failed to start the race after his car was damaged in a qualifying crash. An incident between the championship rivals Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen in the British Grand Prix at Silverstone in July gave Leclerc a surprise chance to win the race, but Hamilton overtook him for the victory.\", \"\\u201cMonaco was very frustrating, because I couldn\\u2019t start the race,\\u201d Leclerc said. \\u201cSilverstone was maybe a little bit less frustrating, because it was such a surprise to be fighting for the win.\\u201d\", \"Sainz quickly settled in and was an even match for Leclerc, having his best season in Formula 1, including four finishes on the podium (Leclerc had one). Sainz said he felt his confidence had grown through the season as he adjusted to his new surroundings.\", \"\\u201cIt helps that I\\u2019ve been here for more races,\\u201d Sainz said. \\u201cWe understand each other, and I\\u2019m scoring more points now. It\\u2019s definitely been great to see the progress and see our team evolving, building confidence and good momentum.\\u201d\", \"Mattia Binotto, the team principal of Ferrari, said he always knew Sainz was a \\u201cvery strong racer\\u201d but was pleased by his contribution to the team this year. \\u201cHe has always scored a lot of points in the race and brought a lot of points to the constructors\\u2019 championship,\\u201d Binotto said. \\u201cHaving that as one of our main targets, it was important for us.\\u201d\", \"Ferrari aimed for third place in the standings this year and has been in a battle with McLaren, which finished third in 2020. McLaren won in Italy this season, finishing first and second, but Ferrari was more consistent toward the end of the year to finish firmly in third.\", \"Binotto said Ferrari feared third place might have been out of reach after McLaren\\u2019s performance at the Italian Grand Prix in September. \\u201cBut the team has been continuously working well, staying focused and really consistent at all the races, and maximized points we could do,\\u201d he said.\", \"Andreas Seidl, the team principal of McLaren, called the result a \\u201cfair reflection\\u201d of the season. \\u201cFerrari came back strong, which was to be expected from a team like Ferrari, which had a very abnormal year last year.\\u201d\", \"Leclerc called the fight for third \\u201ca good exercise as a team to perform under pressure,\\u201d believing it had sharpened Ferrari, and that \\u201call of these things help us if next year we do a step forward and we finally fight for the title.\\u201d\", \"Third may be a satisfying result for Ferrari this year, but it will not be in the long-term. \\u201cIt is really the best we could have done this year, but we know that is not the real objective of Ferrari,\\u201d Binotto said. \\u201cFinishing third gives us some serenity for the winter and try to work well for next year\\u2019s car.\\u201d\", \"There will be a new set of technical regulations next year. The introduction of new car designs, which have revised aerodynamics, means there is an opportunity to make big gains in performance and to challenge Mercedes and Red Bull.\", \"Ferrari opted against continuing to develop its 2021 car throughout the season so it could spend more time on its 2022 model. It has left its rivals expecting a strong car to come out of Maranello, Italy, the team\\u2019s headquarters, next year.\", \"\\u201cI expect them to be very competitive next season,\\u201d said Lando Norris of McLaren. \\u201cThey\\u2019ve had this year where they say they\\u2019ve not developed much and are all focused on next season.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re Ferrari for a reason, and with what they\\u2019ve achieved in the past, I fully expect them to be fighting for wins and podiums and so on next season.\\u201d\", \"Ferrari challenged Mercedes for the championship each season from 2017 to 2019. Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, said his team had to be wary of that threat returning next year.\", \"\\u201cThey are a great entity,\\u201d Wolff said. \\u201cThey have all the resource that is needed, and therefore, we absolutely have them on the radar.\\u201d\", \"Leclerc agreed that 2022 marked a chance for Ferrari to fight for wins and for the championship again. \\u201cI feel like it is a big opportunity for us to come back to where we want to be, which is winning,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"cab7c2265d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cab7c2265d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}},
