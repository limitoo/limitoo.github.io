Can it continue?","country":"us","create_time":"2022-02-04T03:31:50.000Z","content":"[\"World leaders are increasingly deciding that their countries need to figure out how to live with Covid-19 rather than minimize the number of cases.\", \"Britain, France, Denmark, Turkey and other parts of Europe have loosened restrictions. Australia has dropped mask mandates and reopened its border. South Africa has lifted curfews and required schools to open fully.\", \"China is doing none of this.\", \"As the Beijing Olympics begin, China continues to pursue a \\u201czero Covid\\u201d policy. The Olympics will have few fans. As it has for almost two years, China responds to new outbreaks by imposing strict lockdowns. In the northwestern city of Lanzhou last year, officials told roughly four million people to stay home in response to fewer than 50 known cases.\", \"China\\u2019s strategy has had both major successes (holding deaths to low levels) and major costs (disrupting daily life even more than in other countries). It makes for a fascinating case study at a time when Americans disagree vehemently \\u2014 and often along partisan lines \\u2014 about whether to maintain Covid precautions or return to normal.\", \"China\\u2019s strategy would obviously not be possible in a country that emphasizes individual rights as much as the U.S. does. But China\\u2019s strategy does show what a society can do when it makes the prevention of Covid its No. 1 priority, almost regardless of the side effects.\", \"A question that experts are asking now is whether China\\u2019s strategy is sustainable, given the contagiousness of Omicron. For now, China\\u2019s leaders are sticking with it.\", \"Data coming out of China can be suspect, and local officials apparently undercounted Covid cases early in the pandemic to hide the scale of the outbreak. But most experts believe the country\\u2019s official Covid counts have been at least close to accurate for most of the past two years.\", \"That\\u2019s partly because big outbreaks are hard to cover up, and partly because China\\u2019s leadership has threatened to punish officials who hide cases. As Amy Qin, a Times correspondent who covers China, told us, \\u201cLocal officials have every incentive to find the infections and stop the spread before they get out of hand.\\u201d\", \"Even if China\\u2019s official numbers are artificially low, its true Covid death toll is almost certainly much lower than that of the U.S., Europe or many other countries. Consider how enormous the official gap is:\", \"The zero-Covid policy has also allowed some forms of normalcy to return. Masks are required in public, but unless a city is in lockdown, people have been attending parties and eating in restaurants for most of the past two years, Amy notes.\", \"When Covid began spreading in Wuhan, it seemed as if it might have the potential to weaken the Communist Party\\u2019s standing. Instead, China\\u2019s success at controlling Covid has turned into a public relations triumph for the regime. President Xi Jinping uses China\\u2019s management of the virus to bolster his global campaign for influence, arguing that China\\u2019s system of government works better than Western democracies do.\", \"China\\u2019s maximalist approach has had harmful side effects.\", \"Even modest outbreaks can lead local officials to place millions of people under lockdown, sometimes with terrible consequences. As our colleague Li Yuan has written:\", \"Lockdowns have also hurt Chinese businesses and the global economy. One reason that inflation has risen around the world is that Chinese factories and ports have been quick to shut down when there are nearby cases, disrupting supply chains.\", \"Chinese officials maintain that zero Covid is still viable. If that\\u2019s correct, the approach may need to become even more aggressive, given that the Omicron variant is so contagious. China\\u2019s two major vaccines appear to provide significant protection against serious illness but little protection against infection.\", \"China also has little natural immunity, unlike countries where the virus has spread widely. \\u201cThat immunity gap between China and the outside world is only increasing,\\u201d Yanzhong Huang, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us. Some other countries that previously had zero-Covid strategies, like Singapore and New Zealand, have recently moved away from them.\", \"China seems to face a choice \\u201cbetween short-term pain and long-term pain,\\u201d Huang said. Maintaining zero Covid would probably require long-lasting social and economic disruptions; giving it up would invite a rapid surge of infections. \\u201cBut after that you could be in much better shape,\\u201d Huang said.\", \"It does seem possible that China will start to shift its approach after the Olympics, perhaps experimenting with fewer restrictions in some cities and regions. Already, some Chinese health officials have subtly altered their message. \\u201cThey are emphasizing more now the idea of responding rapidly and nimbly to small outbreaks to get as close to zero as possible,\\u201d Amy says.\", \"One factor may be a growing fatigue among Chinese people. While the zero-Covid strategy seems still to have widespread support, some Chinese citizens seem to be growing more frustrated with strict lockdowns. \\u201cWe are definitely seeing more grumbling from people,\\u201d Amy said. \\u201cThere is a growing sense that you could get caught in a lockdown at any time.\\u201d\", \"Related: Activists are urging Olympic athletes to speak out about human rights. China\\u2019s government has reminded them that Chinese law applies to them while they are in Beijing.\", \"In Times Opinion, Maura Elizabeth Cunningham argues that this year\\u2019s Games are about spotlighting Xi\\u2019s control.\", \"A programming note: Starting this weekend, The Morning expands to seven days a week.

But she almost didn\\u2019t make the Olympics because of a stumble in her qualifying tournament. Her teammate Brittany Bowe gave up her spot in the 500 meters for Jackson. Bowe will compete in the 1,000 and 1,500 meters.\", \"Figure skating: At 22, Nathan Chen has won nearly everything but a gold medal, after a disastrous routine kept him off the podium in 2018.
