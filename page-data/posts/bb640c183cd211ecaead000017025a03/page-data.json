to suck up krill and tiny fish in their gullets as they glide through the oceans is much greater than we previously thought, a new study has found.\", \"Each day, baleen whales, which include species such as humpbacks, minke and the mighty blue whale, consume between 5 and 30 per cent of their body mass.\", \"That's\\u00a0three times more food each year than we've measured in the past, according to research published today in the journal Nature.\", \"By underestimating how much these giants of the sea eat, scientists say we may have also underestimated\\u00a0their role in maintaining healthy oceans today, as well as the impact extensive whaling in the early 20th century had on their food sources such as krill.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Our results say that if we restore whale populations to pre-whaling levels seen at the beginning of the 20th century, we'll restore a huge amount of lost function to ocean ecosystems,\\\" said study co-author Nicolas Pyenson of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.\", \"\\\"It may take a few decades to see the benefit, but it's the clearest read yet about the massive role of large whales on our planet.\\\"\", \"<div

fertilisers of the ocean, said Vanessa Pirotta, a marine ecologist at Macquarie University.\", \"\\\"Whales feed in one area, and poo in another \\u2026\\u00a0so they are able to move huge amounts of biomass from one area to another,\\\" said Dr Pirotta, who was not involved in the research.\", \"Their poo helps to suspend key nutrients such as iron on the surface of water, which in turn fuel blooms of microscopic organisms at the bottom of the food chain called phytoplankton.\", \"\\\"Some people refer to this as the iron pump,\\\" Dr Pirotta said.\", \"<img

decline makes\\u00a0no sense unless you factor in the role of whales as mobile fertilisers, said the study's lead author Matthew Savoca of Stanford University.\", \"\\\"These whales were seeding productivity out in the open Southern Ocean and there was very little to recycle this fertiliser once whales were gone,\\u201d Dr Savoca said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How do we know how much a whale eats?</div>\", \"To get a better estimation of how much whales eat, the team tracked 321 whales spanning seven different species swimming in the Atlantic, Pacific and Southern Oceans.\", \"Using camera and motion sensor systems stuck on with suction caps, they monitored when the whales fed.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0dea99a73987e98011511ee7018fc216\\\"

pre-whaling levels.\", \"Dr Pirotta said some\\u00a0species, such as the humpbacks she studies, have bounced back in Australian waters.\", \"\\\"Their numbers have fortunately recovered quite well, but there are still other populations of other baleen whales around the world which have not recovered post whaling,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"There are a number of factors in that, one of those being food availability.\\u00a0But also us as humans, we are limiting their recovery due to anthropogenic impacts such as entanglements, fishing gear and ship strike.\\\"\", \"Changing climate can also play a role in the movement of whales and the abundance of their food.\", \"\\\"We do know that climate change has the potential to change where prey is distributed, which\\u00a0will have flow-on effects
