But Judge Penny said that the current conservator of the singer\\u2019s estate would continue working to settle ongoing financial concerns related to the case.\", \"James P. Spears, Ms. Spears\\u2019s father, who is known as Jamie, first petitioned the court for authority over his adult daughter\\u2019s life and finances in early 2008, citing her very public mental health struggles and possible substance abuse amid a child custody battle. What began as a temporary conservatorship was made permanent by the end of the year.\", \"Since then, the conservatorship has governed both the big business of Britney Spears and the day-to-day reality of the woman at its center, covering her medical care and personal life while putting her back to work as a lucrative performer in Las Vegas and beyond.\", \"Once called a \\u201chybrid business model\\u201d by the former estate conservator who worked alongside Ms. Spears\\u2019s father for years, the setup entered into professional contracts on behalf of the pop star; vetted her friends, visitors and boyfriends; dictated her travel; and logged her every purchase down to a drink from Starbucks.\", \"It also drew questions from Ms. Spears\\u2019s increasingly invested fans and outside observers, who asked why an active global celebrity and working musician was in an arrangement typically reserved for people who cannot feed, clothe or shelter themselves.\", \"Ms. Spears, in her first extended public comments on the conservatorship at a court hearing this summer, said its authority went too far, claiming that those in charge forced her to take medication, work against her will and use a birth control device. She called for them to be investigated and jailed, pointing to Mr. Spears, 69, as \\u201cthe one who approved all of it.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI shouldn\\u2019t be in a conservatorship if I can work. The laws need to change,\\u201d Ms. Spears, 39, said at the time, explaining that her previous silence had been the result of embarrassment and fear. \\u201cI truly believe this conservatorship is abusive. I don\\u2019t feel like I can live a full life.\\u201d\", \"The singer was not present in court on Friday. But ahead of the hearing, she was seen in a video posted to Instagram by her fianc\\u00e9, Sam Asghari, wearing a T-shirt that read #FREEBRITNEY above the phrase \\u201cIt\\u2019s a human rights movement,\\u201d while her song \\u201cWork Bitch\\u201d played in the background.\", \"A lawyer for Ms. Spears, Mathew S. Rosengart, repeated some of the singer\\u2019s recent comments about the conservatorship in court on Friday at her behest, he said.\", \"\\u201cI just want my life back,\\u201d Mr. Rosengart told the judge, quoting Ms. Spears.\", \"Ms. Spears responded to the ruling on social media Friday evening. \\u201cGood God I love my fans so much it\\u2019s crazy,\\u201d she wrote, adding some emojis. \\u201cI think I\\u2019m gonna cry the rest of the day !!!! Best day ever \\u2026 praise the Lord \\u2026 can I get an Amen.\\u201d\", \"Any notion that Ms. Spears was content to be in the conservatorship \\u2014 her father and his representatives had routinely called it both necessary and voluntary \\u2014 crumbled on June 23 when she spoke about it extensively in public for the first time.\", \"After requesting to address the judge directly, Ms. Spears made a shocking, emotional call into court, speaking for more than 20 minutes. And while the great majority of the hearings in the case had happened behind closed doors, with Ms. Spears appearing rarely and speaking only in private when she did, the June hearing was streamed live online because of Covid-19 protocols. Ms. Spears insisted that her remarks be heard by all who were tuning in.\", \"Already, Ms. Spears had begun seeking substantial changes to the conservatorship, starting in 2019, when she also announced \\u201can indefinite work hiatus.\\u201d But the singer was at first required to use the same court-appointed lawyer she had since 2008, when she was found at the outset of the case to be mentally incapable of hiring her own counsel.\", \"Behind the scenes, Ms. Spears had routinely bristled at the strictures of the arrangement, according to reporting and confidential documents obtained by The New York Times. Having objected to her father\\u2019s role from the start because of his turbulent and intermittent presence in her life since childhood, she continued to question Mr. Spears\\u2019s fitness as conservator, citing his drinking and calling him \\u201cobsessed\\u201d with controlling her.\", \"But little would change for years.\", \"In 2016, Ms. Spears told a court investigator that the arrangement was oppressive and that she was \\u201csick of being taken advantage of,\\u201d according to the investigator\\u2019s account of the conversation. Still, the investigator\\u2019s report concluded that the conservatorship remained in Ms. Spears\\u2019s best interest based on her complex finances, susceptibility to undue influence and \\u201cintermittent\\u201d drug issues, even as it called for \\u201ca pathway to independence\\u201d and eventually, termination.\", \"In 2019, Ms. Spears told the court that she had felt forced into a stay at a mental health facility and that she was made to perform while sick, according to a transcript of the closed-door hearing. She said later that she did not feel like she had been heard.\", \"In her comments at the June hearing, Ms. Spears said she did not know that she could file to end the arrangement altogether. Her lawyer, Samuel D. Ingham III, soon resigned, as did a wealth management firm that was set to take over as the co-conservator of the estate. Outside the conservatorship, the singer\\u2019s longtime manager, Larry Rudolph, also stepped down. Judge Penny allowed Ms. Spears to select a new lawyer the next month.\", \"Mr. Rosengart, a former federal prosecutor who has worked extensively in Hollywood, took over the case, calling for an extensive re-examination of the entire arrangement and pushing for Mr. Spears\\u2019s immediate suspension as estate conservator; that was granted in September. Ms. Spears had said previously that she was afraid of her estranged father, even as he remained the steward of her nearly $60 million fortune, and would not return to performing with him in charge.\", \"In an abrupt about-face in September, ahead of his own suspension, Mr. Spears moved to end the conservatorship entirely. Mr. Rosengart argued that the turnaround was designed so that Mr. Spears, who earned a salary as conservator and commissions from his daughter\\u2019s career, could avoid legal discovery and being deposed under oath about his earnings and financial management of her estate.\", \"Mr. Rosengart has sought to investigate Mr. Spears\\u2019s dealings with the estate\\u2019s former business manager, Tri Star Sports & Entertainment Group, along with a security firm that monitored the singer, including secretly capturing audio recordings from her bedroom and accessing material from her phone, according to a documentary on the subject by The Times.\", \"Mr. Spears\\u2019s new legal team, hired after his removal, has said he stands by his record as conservator and \\u201csupports, indeed encourages, a full and transparent examination.\\u201d\", \"Lawyers for Tri Star denied in court filings that the company\\u2019s employees had any control over Ms. Spears\\u2019s security protocols, including hidden electronic surveillance, and said that its financial dealings with the estate were approved by the court before the firm\\u2019s resignation from the conservatorship last year.\", \"But even as the battle continues in court \\u2014 with subsequent hearings scheduled to address the outstanding financial issues and investigations tied to the conservatorship \\u2014 both sides came to agree that the arrangement should end.\", \"In addition to Ms. Spears and her father, the singer\\u2019s personal conservator, Jodi Montgomery, also consented, according to court filings, and worked with Mr. Rosengart on a \\u201ctermination care plan\\u201d that was filed with the court under seal. (Ms. Montgomery took over those duties from Mr. Spears on an ongoing temporary basis in September 2019, when he resigned citing health issues.)\", \"Still, Mr. Rosengart said in court on Friday that Ms. Spears wanted a financial and personal \\u201csafety net\\u201d even after the conservatorship was terminated.\", \"John Zabel, the certified public accountant who took over the estate in September, would retain \\u201climited administrative powers,\\u201d the lawyer said, including the ability to execute estate planning and transfer outside assets into an existing trust for Ms. Spears. Ms. Montgomery, too, would be there for Ms. Spears if she needed help, her lawyer, Lauriann Wright, said.\", \"The parties, Mr. Rosengart said, had \\u201cengaged in an orderly transfer of power.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Spears had insisted that the arrangement end without her having to undergo further psychological assessments, which judges typically rely on when considering whether to restore independence to someone under a conservatorship.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think I owe anyone to be evaluated,\\u201d Ms. Spears told the court in June. Mr. Spears later agreed in his own court filings, and Judge Penny ultimately concurred.\", \"But several experts said they had expected the judge to require a mental health evaluation, and that it was highly unusual for her to end the conservatorship without one.\", \"\\u201cBased upon the information on the public record, and the history of alleged mental health issues, I am shocked that the conservatorship was terminated without a current mental health evaluation,\\u201d said Victoria J. Haneman, a trusts and estates law professor at Creighton University. \\u201cI had no doubt that a clear path to termination would be agreed upon, but I did not think in a million years that it would all end today.\\u201d\", \"In this case, the singer\\u2019s extensive r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 as a conservatee seemed to be enough.\", \"One of the best-selling artists of all time, Ms. Spears released four of her nine studio albums while under the conservatorship, including, most recently, \\u201cGlory\\u201d in 2016. She appeared on television, serving as a judge on \\u201cThe X Factor\\u201d in 2012, and even toured internationally, though most of her performances were part of a strictly controlled Las Vegas residency.\", \"Beginning in 2013, \\u201cBritney: Piece of Me\\u201d ran for four years at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, grossing a reported $138 million across nearly 250 shows. A follow-up Vegas show, \\u201cBritney: Domination,\\u201d was canceled in 2019.\", \"The millions Ms. Spears amassed in her career will continue to be pored over in minute detail as the many lawyers and other professionals who have been involved in the conservatorship proceedings seek approval by the court to be paid.\", \"Up to this point, all expenses incurred in the case \\u2014 including the legal fees of those fighting against Ms. Spears\\u2019s wishes \\u2014 have been billed to the singer\\u2019s estate. Mr. Rosengart has made a formal objection to a request for fees by former lawyers for Mr. Spears, calling the totals \\u2014 some related to \\u201cmedia matters\\u201d in defense of the conservatorship \\u2014 \\u201coutrageous and exorbitant.\\u201d\", \"Others seeking payment include Mr. Rosengart; Mr. Ingham, Ms. Spears\\u2019s former court-appointed lawyer; another firm he brought on board for litigation assistance; Ms. Montgomery and her lawyers; and lawyers for Lynne Spears, the singer\\u2019s mother and an \\u201cinterested party\\u201d in the conservatorship since 2019. Additional hearings in the case are scheduled for Dec. 8 and Jan. 19.\", \"Outside the courthouse, amid cheering fans, Mr. Rosengart said that Ms. Spears\\u2019s conservatorship had shined a light on potential abuses in the wider system. \\u201cIf this happened to Britney, it can happen to anybody,\\u201d he said.\", \"When asked whether Ms. Spears would ever perform again, the lawyer added that, for the first time in years, \\u201cit\\u2019s up to her.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"949e7ce6441e11ec856083d4d35ec62f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"949e7ce6441e11ec856083d4d35ec62f"}},
