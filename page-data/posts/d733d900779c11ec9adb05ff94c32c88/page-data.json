Now he has knocked off his first Australian Open win.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-01-17T05:55:05.000Z","content":"[\"MELBOURNE, Australia \\u2014 Sebastian Korda spent his first week of a long-awaited trip to Australia far from the summer sunshine he imagined: After testing positive for coronavirus upon landing in the country, Korda was quarantined in a hotel room in Adelaide, hitting a ball against the headboard of his bed.\", \"Though one unfortunate carom off the ceiling left Korda doubled over in pain, the weeklong confinement would not contain his growing talent: In his first match of the year, Korda comprehensively defeated 12th-seeded Cameron Norrie of Britain, 6-3, 6-0, 6-4, in a first-round match at the Australian Open\\u2019s new Kia Arena.\", \"\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t easy,\\u201d Korda said after his win. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t get a lot of preparation, didn\\u2019t get any matches under my belt.\\u201d\", \"It was the first main draw match here for Korda, 21, who won the Australian Open boys\\u2019 title four years ago. Korda skipped the Open last year, opting to play a small tournament in France, which he won to break into the top 100 for the first time.\", \"Though he had stayed away since his junior triumph, Korda feels a close connection to Australia: His father, Petr, won his lone Grand Slam title here in 1998, and both of his sisters have won the Women\\u2019s Australian Open golf tournament, with Jessica winning in 2012 and Nelly, currently the top ranked player in the L.P.G.A., winning in 2019.\", \"\\u201cLots of success here in Australia,\\u201d Sebastian Korda said. \\u201cI\\u2019m always super happy to be here. The fans are incredible, the tournament\\u2019s unbelievable, and, yeah, I\\u2019m just really comfortable here. They always make me feel like home here.\\u201d\", \"Norrie grew up nearer to Melbourne, in New Zealand, but couldn\\u2019t find any comfort against Korda and his dominant serve. Korda won 77 percent of points on his first serve, and saved all three break points he faced in the match.\", \"Norrie, who surged into the Top 20 with a surprise title at the Indian Wells Masters event last October, said Monday\\u2019s loss had been \\u201cmaybe my worst match in the last eight months\\u201d but called Korda \\u201ca great player\\u201d and said the match \\u201cmay have even been difficult if I was playing great still.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe can come forward \\u2014 very skillful around the net,\\u201d Norrie added. \\u201cHe served well in big points today, and was too good for me.\\u201d\", \"Korda, ranked 43rd, is part of a tightly-packed peloton that is leading American men\\u2019s tennis as they chase the sport\\u2019s best. Though no American man is currently ranked inside the ATP Top 20, there are five Americans ahead of Korda, led by the 22nd-ranked Taylor Fritz.\", \"\\u201cI think we\\u2019re all pushing each other,\\u201d Korda said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s always an American pushing going further in tournaments, so it\\u2019s inspiring for all of us \\u2014 it\\u2019s like a little competition between us.\\u201d\", \"The ones in the front of the pack see Korda gaining fast.\", \"\\u201cSo clean,\\u201d 41st-ranked Tommy Paul, who won in straight sets Monday over Mikhail Kukushkin, said of Korda. \\u201cFun to watch.\\u201d\", \"The 29th-ranked Reilly Opelka, an outspoken cheerleader for his fellow American players, said that the 6-foot-5 Korda \\u201chas definitely got the body to be great.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s got the Tsitsipas-Medvedev-Zverev build; that\\u2019s kind of the new, modern thing,\\u201d Opelka said, citing three top-five players. \\u201cHe moves well. Great backhand.\\u201d Opelka said that he was especially impressed by Korda\\u2019s biggest results having come at Grand Slam events, including a run to the fourth round of the 2020 French Open and last year\\u2019s Wimbledon. \\u201cYou can fake it for a set-and-a-half if a guy is off,\\u201d Opelka said. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t hide it for five sets.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cKorda, if my life\\u2019s on the line, he\\u2019s my safest call,\\u201d Opelka said. \\u201cHe really is.
