The population center has been in Missouri since 1980, and that's not likely to change this year, according to the Associated Press.\", \"Alex Zakrewsky, the principal urban planner for Middlesex County, New Jersey, said the most likely location is somewhere in Missouri's Wright County.\", \"Zakrewsky accurately predicted the current center a decade ago: Plato, Missouri, a village in the Ozarks with only 82 residents.\", \"If his predictions are accurate again, the center will move only 12.8 miles southwest of Plato. This would be the slowest advancement of the nation's center out of every census, beating out the current slowest move from the 1910-1920 census, when the shift was 13 miles.\", \"Compared to the 1850-1860 census, where the advancement was 103 miles, this shows a considerable slowdown.\", \"\\\"An aging population, ongoing economic difficulties, and the impact of the pandemic have worked to reduce the means and reason for Americans to move,\\\" Zakrewsky said.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932490/plato-missouri-small-town.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The U.S. Census Bureau is announcing where the new population center of the U.S. is located.

Most folks in Texas County, which is home to Plato, have no idea they're at the center of the U.S., said Scott Long, the presiding commissioner of Texas County, where beef cattle outnumber people.\", \"\\\"I don't think it has changed the day-to-day lives of the people of this county, but I don't want to say that in a way that means we don't care,\\\" Long said. \\\"It's one of those things most people don't even know.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932493/plato-missouri-small-town.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The new center of the U.S. is expected to be somewhere in the Missouri Ozarks.
