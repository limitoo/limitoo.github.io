The Coast Guard has not said what caused the Ever Forward to run aground.\", \"The ship became stuck outside the shipping channel and did not block marine navigation, unlike last year's high-profile grounding in the Suez Canal of its sister vessel, the Ever Given. That incident disrupted ship traffic and the global supply chain for days.\", \"Salvage crews continued to offload containers from the Ever Forward until 10:30 p.m. Saturday. The containers were placed onto barges and taken to Baltimore's Seagirt Marine Terminal.\", \"After two failed efforts to free the more than 1,000-foot vessel, salvage experts determined earlier this month that unloading some of the containers offered the best chance to refloat it. Crews also continued dredging to a depth of 43 feet around the vessel.\"]","href_hash":"dba6ffccbe7211ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dba6ffccbe7211ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
