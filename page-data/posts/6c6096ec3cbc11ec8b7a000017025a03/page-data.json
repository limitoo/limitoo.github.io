The U.S. and other countries have called on China to pledge bigger commitments, which Xi's administration said will only be possible with political concessions.\", \"While speaking at the COP26 summit Monday, Biden said that it was a \\\"big mistake\\\" for China not to make an in-person appearance at the talks.

Like all Chinese leaders, Xi is extremely image conscious and his public appearances are carefully choreographed to avoid potentially embarrassing confrontations.\", \"His formerly heavy travel schedule took him across continents, with first lady Peng Liyuan, an accomplished musician, on hand to add a bit of glamor and a human touch.\", \"Those travels included trips to several African nations and a meeting with the former Japanese emperor in Tokyo. Xi rode in a gilded carriage with Britain's Queen Elizabeth and paid a visit to North Korea's capital that included a ride through city streets lined by tens of thousands of cheering citizens of the hard-line communist state.\", \"Such travels have underscored China's more assertive foreign policy, as the world's second-largest economy seeks to exert its influence beyond East Asia with Xi's signature \\\"Belt and Road\\\" overseas infrastructure investment program.\", \"The president's decision not to attend the meetings in Rome and Glasgow seems at odds with that policy, although Xi isn't alone in staying away.
