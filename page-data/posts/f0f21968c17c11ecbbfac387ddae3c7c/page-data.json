And if you don't have it, you have nothing. Once I got older into my 40s, I started asking a really, really important question, which is, 'Why?' Who said I'm not beautiful? And then something happened within all of that. This little flicker, this little voice that said, 'I have the power to reject that. That is an opinion.
