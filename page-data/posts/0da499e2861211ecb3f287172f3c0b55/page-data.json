They currently number about 100,000.\", \"The tensions come eight years after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula and backed a bloody rebellion in the eastern Donbas region.\", \"Senior US administration officials said the alleged false flag operation, planned by Russian security services, would show images of civilian casualties in the Donbas, in order to generate outrage against the Ukrainian authorities.\", \"This could then be used to justify an attack on Ukraine, the officials said.\", \"The plan could involve staging and filming a faked attack, they said.\", \"It would show corpses and destroyed locations, faked Ukrainian military equipment, Turkish-made drones and actors playing Russian-speaking mourners, they said.\", \"But the officials stressed that this was only one of the options Russia was considering, and said they were publicising it in an effort to \\\"dissuade Russia from its intended course of action\\\".\", \"UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the US intelligence \\\"is clear and shocking evidence of Russia's unprovoked aggression and underhand activity to destabilise Ukraine\\\".\", \"\\\"This bellicose intent towards a sovereign, democratic country is completely unacceptable and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.
