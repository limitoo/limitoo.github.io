As part of the cold case investigation, the Texas Rangers, the state\\u2019s elite law enforcement unit, were also enlisted.\", \"The sheriff, Trace Hendricks, said in the Facebook post that investigators, working on a tip that Mr. Creech\\u2019s remains might be located in the lake, had discovered more than a dozen sunken vehicles during the three-day search, which began on Friday.\", \"Sheriff Hendricks was out of the office this week because of coronavirus protocols and not immediately available to answer additional questions, an aide said on Thursday.\", \"The sheriff had contacted Adventures With Purpose, a team of divers that got its start searching for old cars as a way of cleaning up the environment in 2019, to help with the search about two months ago, Jared Leisek, the group\\u2019s founder, said on Thursday.\", \"Mr. Leisek, 46, declined to provide details of the car or items that they found, but shared that officials \\u201csuspect foul play.\\u201d\", \"Using three different types of monitors on their boat, Mr. Leisek\\u2019s divers found a total of 13 vehicles: seven on the southwest side of Lake Whitney\\u2019s dam; five submerged in the reservoir at depths of 30 to 65 feet; and one of the opposite, Hill County side of the dam.\", \"Diving into the reservoir\\u2019s murky water, the team was able to examine the seven cars on the southwest side of the dam and pull two of them out, Mr. Leisek said. The other five vehicles in Bosque County waters could not be searched because the divers didn\\u2019t have enough oxygen to reach those depths.\", \"\\u201cThe vehicles that we did dive on and locate were all 30 to 40 years or older,\\u201d he said, \\u201cThe vehicle in question that we were looking for needed to be underwater for 13 years, more or less.\\u201d\", \"Cars that have been in the water for more than three decades look like \\u201cSwiss cheese,\\u201d he explained, making it hard to examine them, let alone remove them from the water.\", \"But the fact that the dam-adjacent cars were not at the bottom of Lake Whitney, where sediment and debris accumulate, made it easier to investigate them, he explained.\", \"was If the divers don\\u2019t find what they are looking for \\u201con the first try,\\u201d Mr. Leisek said, they often find answers after uploading their search footage to YouTube.
