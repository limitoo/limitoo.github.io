However, on Wednesday, Rodgers tested positive for the virus.\", \"In a Friday interview, Rodgers revealed that he hadn't been vaccinated against COVID-19 for fear of blood clots and infertility. Clinical research hasn't linked COVID-19 vaccines to male infertility issues, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Blood clots are rare among male vaccine recipients, the CDC also said.\", \"Rodgers has admitted to violating at least two NFL protocols requiring mask-wearing in public. He also said that he has taken the anti-malaria medication hydroxychloroquine and the anti-parasite medication ivermectin to treat his COVID-19 symptoms. Medical authorities have said both medications have no proven effect on coronavirus symptoms.\", \"In response to Rodgers' claims, writer and podcaster Jemele Hill wrote, \\\"Aaron Rodgers probably was this close to admitting he didn't get vaccinated because it carries the mark of the beast.\\\"\", \"Political writer Wajahat Ali wrote, \\\"We even lost Aaron Rodgers to disinformation and all-around nuttiness. I hope the NFL punishes him and the Packers for lying and exposing his teammates and the Packers staff to potential health risks.\\\"\", \"Author Frederick Joseph wrote, \\\"The 'shut up and dribble' crowd has been real quiet about Aaron Rodgers suddenly becoming one of the top scientists and doctors in the world.\\\"\", \"Author Chip Franklin mocked Rodgers' admission on Friday that he's getting medical advice on how to treat his COVID-19 symptoms from vaccine skeptic Joe Rogan. Franklin wrote, \\\"Aaron Rodgers say his doctor suggested homeopathy over vaccines. Where did Joe Rogan go to medical school?\\\"\", \"Politics writer Astead Herndon wrote, \\\"have we considered the possibility that Aaron rodgers is nicki minajs cousins friend\\\". His comment was a reference to Minaj's claim earlier this year that her cousin's friend experienced swollen testicles in response to the vaccine.\", \"Actor Josiah Johnson posted an image of a car driver staring down another driver and joked, \\\"When Dr. Fauci see Aaron Rodgers.\\\" His joke was a reference to Anthony Fauci, the nationally renowned infectious diseases expert.\", \"Comedy writer Roy Wood Jr. wrote, \\\"I can't remember who made the inflatable needles for fans to heckle Barry Bonds w/ back in the day, but now is your time. Pull up to Aaron Rodgers first game back & sell them to opposing fans.\\\"\", \"Comedian Louis Virtel wrote, \\\"These Aaron Rodgers quotes are like watching a desperate third-place contestant on Jeopardy! buzz in and get every question wrong until they are so far in the red it's awe-inspiring.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927629/aaron-rodgers-covid-19-vaccination-twitter-reactions.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers has been criticized on Twitter for his misinformed views on COVID-19.
