Four people close to the committee told CBS News that several members want Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' wife, who goes by Ginni, to talk to the committee and will issue a subpoena if necessary.\\u00a0\", \"At least two committee members, the people said, were making private calls to colleagues on Friday, encouraging more discussion of a subpoena for Ginni Thomas. But there's not yet any consensus on the committee about whether to move forward, they said.\", \"Committee members will return to Washington next week.\", \"The extraordinary text messages show her encouraging President Trump's top aide to fight to overturn the 2020 election. Citing Trump allies who were gathering evidence of alleged fraud, Thomas wrote Meadows on November 19, saying, \\\"Make a plan...and save us from the left taking America down.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Thomas' outreach may have gone further than just Meadows. In another text to him, she writes, \\\"Just forwarded to yr gmail an email I sent Jared this am.\\\" It's not clear who she's referring to. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, was another top aide.\\u00a0\", \"CBS News has reached out to Ginni Thomas multiple times for comment on the text messages.

Most of us are disgusted with the VP.\\\"\", \"Thomas recently\\u00a0acknowledged\\u00a0she attended the January 6 rally in front of the White House, but said she had nothing to do with the insurrection.
