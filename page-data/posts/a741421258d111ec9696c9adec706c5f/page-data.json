Today we\\u2019ll meet David Banks, who has been chosen to be schools chancellor by the next mayor, Eric Adams, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. We\\u2019ll also look at ethics rulings that the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, fought to keep secret.\", \"He stood, beaming, beside Eric Adams on the night in June when it became clear that Adams would win the Democratic nomination for mayor. Now David Banks is expected to be Adams\\u2019s first major appointment, as the next chancellor of New York City\\u2019s public school system.\", \"Adams is scheduled to make the announcement today at Public School 161, the elementary school that Banks attended as a child, in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.\", \"Banks, who is 59 and has had his eye on the chancellor\\u2019s job for years, is a former teacher and principal who created a network of all-boys schools, the Eagle Academy for Young Men. It is considered by many to be a bright spot in the city\\u2019s halting efforts to make the system fairer for Black and Latino students, who have long been relegated to segregated, low-performing schools.\", \"As chancellor, Banks will inherit a school system laboring to move past the disruptions of the pandemic. He told my colleague Eliza Shapiro that his first priorities would include expanding early childhood education options for the city\\u2019s youngest children; improving career pathways for older students; and combating students\\u2019 trauma. He will also have to decide whether to admit students into gifted and talented classes, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in October that he was phasing out.\", \"\\u201cI want to help transform the lives of so many of our children, but particularly Black and brown children who have struggled the most in this system,\\u201d Mr. Banks said in a recent interview with The New York Times. \\u201cThey need people to be bold on their behalf.\\u201d He added that without sweeping changes, \\u201cyou\\u2019re just going to play around in the margins.\\u201d\", \"Banks brings several advantages to the job that could make him the most powerful schools chancellor since Joel Klein took charge 19 years ago and concluded that the job was \\u201cabout the tough work of changing the system.\\u201d\", \"It is not yet clear how Banks\\u2019s success in building the Eagle network will translate to a system with 1,600 schools, many of which lack the leadership and fund-raising aptitude that Eagle has demonstrated. But Banks is familiar with the city\\u2019s labyrinthine educational bureaucracy, which could stifle a newcomer. He has also close ties not only with elected officials but also with business and philanthropic leaders, some of whom he has enlisted to mentor Eagle students.\", \"Another plus: He will have more money to spend as chancellor, the result of a recent state education funding settlement as well as federal pandemic support funding.\", \"And, perhaps most important, he will have room to maneuver. While Mayor Bill de Blasio was known to micromanage his commissioners, Adams has signaled that his top advisers will have more leeway.\", \"Banks has already begun to fill top jobs in the Education Department. Daniel Weisberg, who was the lead labor strategist for schools when Michael Bloomberg was mayor and now runs an organization focused on teacher training and quality, will serve as Banks\\u2019s first deputy. Banks has also recruited Kenita Lloyd, the chief operating officer of the Eagle Academy Foundation, to be deputy chancellor for family engagement.\", \"Temps are in the low 40s as clouds increase throughout the day. The evening is mostly cloudy with temps dropping to the mid-30s.\", \"In effect until Dec. 24 (Christmas Eve).\", \"As Mayor Bill de Blasio nears the end of his years in City Hall and lays the groundwork for a possible campaign for governor, questions about his fund-raising could arise.\", \"In 2014, he called two real estate developers who had projects underway in the city and asked them to donate to a nonprofit organization he had set up.\", \"The request to help his nonprofit, the Campaign for One New York, seemed to violate the city\\u2019s ethics law as well as a ban against asking for contributions from people who had business pending with the city. Within months, de Blasio was formally warned by the city\\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Board, in a previously undisclosed letter, against making such requests.\", \"But the mayor continued to contact potential donors, according to documents that the city has now released.\", \"[De Blasio Fought for 2 Years to Keep Ethics Warning Secret. Here\\u2019s Why.]\", \"The new details of de Blasio\\u2019s outreach to donors were contained in a pair of secret letters that the city\\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Board sent the mayor. The first letter, dated July 2014, said the mayor had violated ethics laws with the two find-raising calls to developers. The second letter, in September 2018, found that de Blasio had continued the practice and reprimanded him.\", \"\\u201cBy soliciting these three donations from firms with business pending or about to be pending before executive agencies,\\u201d the second letter said, referring to de Blasio\\u2019s 2018 fund-raising efforts, \\u201cyou not only disregarded the board\\u2019s repeated written advice, but created the very appearance of coercion and improper access to you and your staff that the board\\u2019s advice sought to help you avoid.\\u201d\", \"The letters were released this week, after the state Court of Appeals denied the latest move by the mayor\\u2019s office, which had opposed The Times\\u2019s efforts to obtain them, first by rejecting a Freedom of Information request and then by fighting a lawsuit filed by The Times. The Campaign for One New York was shut down in 2016 after raising more than $4 million.\", \"The jury in Ghislaine Maxwell\\u2019s sex-trafficking trial heard from four prosecution witnesses on Wednesday. They served to bolster the testimony of the government\\u2019s main witnesses, three women who said they were sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein, with Maxwell\\u2019s help.\", \"The first witness on Wednesday was Janine Gill, the human resources director at former President Donald J. Trump\\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. That is where Virginia Roberts \\u2014 one of Epstein\\u2019s most outspoken accusers, now called Virginia Giuffre \\u2014 has said she first met Maxwell.\", \"Giuffre has not taken the stand. But a former Epstein employee told the jury last week that he and Maxwell had met her at Mar-a-Lago. Evidence introduced on Wednesday indicated that Giuffre\\u2019s father had worked at the resort around the time of the encounter.\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"I moved to the Upper West Side in January 2007 without knowing anyone in the city. I felt so alone.\", \"On my first Friday night, it was freezing out and I had nothing to do, so I killed time walking up and down Broadway, looking into the windows of shops and restaurants.\", \"Passing a pizza place, I stopped to look inside. A man and a woman, maybe in their 40s, were sitting down for one of those $1 slices that soak the paper plate through with grease.\", \"Once they were sitting, they lifted their slices without saying a word and cheers-ed them as if they were champagne glasses.\", \"I could tell by the way they did it that I was witnessing a tradition. They weren\\u2019t alone like me. They had each other and a tradition, a shared experience they returned to again and again.\", \"At least that is what I imagined as I stared in from the cold, tears welling in my eyes. I was so sure then that I would never find someone to toast pizza with me. New York can be the most bustling and yet still lonely place.\", \"But it is also full of people to find. On a frigid night almost 15 years later, I grabbed some pizza with my husband. And when we sat down inside the tiny pizzeria, I made him cheers his slice with mine.\", \"\\u2014 Lauren Passell\", \"Illustrated by Agnes Lee.
