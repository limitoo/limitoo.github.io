They want this but they need to be supported in doing that and we're up for that challenge,\\\" she said.\", \"Berhampore School principal Mark Potter said teachers had never stopped using phonics, but he agreed they needed more help finding the most effective teaching strategies.\", \"\\\"There's been a lot of work having to be put in by each school, each teacher to try and make sense of what's out there. What this report is looking at doing is trying to remove a lot of that burden, to actually get some really good qualified, experienced people to pull together a sound, planned idea of progression that means a lot of that burden is not on the school and the individual teachers,\\\" he said.\", \"Potter, who is also vice-president of the Educational Institute, said he also liked the strategy's plan to create greater links between the school curriculum and the early childhood curriculum, Te Wh\\u0101riki.\", \"\\\"That's very important to developing children's literacy,\\\" he said.\", \"Berhampore School literacy leader Michelle McCracken said the strategy had come at a time when literacy and numeracy were at the forefront of teachers' thinking.\", \"\\\"It's very much on top for us and very much based on the data that we're gathering about the kids, anecdotally when we have the kids in front of us and the standardised [testing] approaches we're also seeing this worrying trend of low levels of literacy from our children walking in the door but also walking out the door,\\\" she said.\", \"McCracken said she was pleased to see the strategy included a system of \\\"safety nets\\\" for learners and evidence-based help for children who struggled, including those problems such as dyslexia.\", \"But she warned that the ministry would not be able to force teachers to use particular teaching methods.\", \"\\\"If the ministry comes at us with like 'these are the seven approved tools that we want you use' there'll be push-back because we'll go 'at our school we use these tools because we see the efficacy in them'. So as long as it's a dialogue between teachers and the ministry,\\\" she said.\", \"Wellington's Discovery School principal Kaylene Macnee was at the strategy launch and said she was optimistic that it would work.\", \"\\\"The link to the curriculum, with that happening at the same time the refresh of the curriculum, I'm optimistic that that's going to give us greater clarity for our teachers to know what to teach, when to teach it, how to do it best,\\\" she said.\"]","href_hash":"426dfce4abfc11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"426dfce4abfc11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
