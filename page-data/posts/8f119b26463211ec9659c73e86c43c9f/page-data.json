Lawyers for the firm have largely refused.\", \"Court documents filed recently show a battle over financial disclosures is playing out even though the conservatorship was terminated by a judge on Friday.\", \"Ms. Spears\\u2019s lawyer, Mathew S. Rosengart, has indicated he plans to pursue the financial inquiry regardless of the conservatorship\\u2019s status. Ms. Spears\\u2019s estate is estimated at nearly $60 million, but her legal team wants to investigate whether any money was mismanaged during the conservatorship.\", \"The financial disputes are expected to be addressed at a court hearing scheduled for Jan. 19.\", \"Tri Star Sports & Entertainment Group, a firm run by Louise M. Taylor that provides entertainers and athletes with accounting and financial services, resigned last fall after serving as the estate\\u2019s business manager for over a decade.\", \"In September, Mr. Rosengart asked lawyers for Tri Star a central question: How much money was Tri Star paid by Ms. Spears or her estate during the conservatorship?\", \"In a heated email exchange, lawyers for Tri Star repeatedly responded that the answer was in the court accountings that the firm had already shared, but would not provide a number.\", \"In the documents filed last week, Mr. Rosengart accused Tri Star of \\u201ccontinued stonewalling.\\u201d\", \"On Oct. 1, Mr. Rosengart issued subpoenas to Tri Star and its employee Robin Greenhill, who worked closely on Ms. Spears\\u2019s account. The requests for discovery and depositions focus on Tri Star\\u2019s compensation during the conservatorship, the estate\\u2019s business entities and communications about creating the conservatorship, Ms. Spears\\u2019s medical treatment and any surveillance of the pop singer.\", \"A lawyer for Tri Star, Scott A. Edelman, asked the court to limit the subpoenas to cover only a narrow dispute over the estate\\u2019s accounting in 2019. In the filing, Mr. Edelman said that Tri Star had passed along its books to the estate\\u2019s current business manager and that the firm would not produce documents from accountings before 2019 that had already been approved by the court\", \"Also in dispute in the legal exchange is whether Tri Star has a copy of its written contract with the estate and whether Tri Star was a fiduciary, which typically would have required the firm to put the interest of its client ahead of its own.\", \"A declaration by Ms. Greenhill submitted to the court said that \\u201cno one at Tri Star is aware of any hidden electronic surveillance device placed in Ms. Spears\\u2019s bedroom.\\u201d The New York Times first reported allegations in the documentary \\u201cControlling Britney Spears\\u201d that the security firm Black Box Security monitored Ms. Spears\\u2019s phone, including her communications with her lawyer, and secretly recorded her in her bedroom.\", \"Two weeks ago, a court filing disclosed that, in August, Mr. Rosengart served Ms. Spears\\u2019s father, James P. Spears, with requests for extensive discovery and a sworn deposition, including how much money he has received from his daughter\\u2019s estate during the conservatorship. Mr. Spears was suspended as overseer of her estate by the court on Sept. 29.\", \"A lawyer for Mr. Spears then filed court papers stating that he would unconditionally cooperate with transferring all records to Ms. Spears\\u2019s lawyer.\", \"But in comments to the news media after the termination hearing on Friday, Mr. Rosengart said that Mr. Spears has not responded to a single document request and has twice failed to appear for his deposition.\"]","href_hash":"8f119b26463211ec9659c73e86c43c9f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8f119b26463211ec9659c73e86c43c9f"}},
