Now, the lock pad signaled, such complaints were no longer welcome.\", \"For many employees, the closed room was an emblem of the broader transformation sweeping through RTHK, the 93-year-old institution venerated by residents as one of the most trusted news sources in Hong Kong\\u2019s once freewheeling media landscape.\", \"RTHK was once compared to the BBC for its fierce editorial independence. But under a sweeping national security law that Beijing imposed last year to silence dissent, many say it now more closely resembles China Central Television, the propagandistic Chinese state broadcaster.\", \"Since Mr. Li arrived in March, episodes featuring interviews with government critics have been dropped hours before they were to air. Historical dramas about the Chinese Communist Party fill prime-time slots. Whole shows have been eliminated \\u2014 with hosts told this would be their last taping only after they recorded it.\", \"New editorial guidelines issued in September order staffers to \\u201cassist in the promotion\\u201d of the government\\u2019s work \\u201con safeguarding national security.\\u201d They are also to \\u201cbe cautious in contacts\\u201d with foreign governments and \\u201cpolitical organizations.\\u201d The directives come as Xi Jinping tightens his iron grip on Hong Kong and China, most notably at a meeting this week in Beijing.\", \"Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\\u2019s chief executive, has praised Mr. Li for doing \\u201cexactly what I expect from a chief editor.\\u201d Soon afterward, Mrs. Lam announced that she had been given her own RTHK talk show.\", \"RTHK, which doggedly investigated official misconduct during anti-government protests in 2019, was long expected to come under pressure. Under the security law \\u2014 imposed to quell the protests \\u2014 officials have dismantled Hong Kong\\u2019s civil society and attacked media outlets deemed unfriendly.\", \"Still, a dozen current and former staffers, some of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were astonished by the speed and boldness of the changes \\u2014 not least because of the broadcaster\\u2019s history of fending off incursions on its independence. \", \"\\u201cIn the past, there were a lot of checks and balances,\\u201d said Tsang Chi-Ho, who co-hosted a long-running satire show and radio program before his firing this summer. Now, \\u201cif they cut a program, what can you do? There\\u2019s no legislator to oppose it, no newspaper to say that\\u2019s wrong. No one can protest on the streets.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cTheir goal is to tell everyone: Just forget the RTHK of the past.\\u201d\", \"RTHK declined to make Mr. Li available for an interview. In a statement, the broadcaster said it would not comment on internal matters, but that changes had been made in RTHK\\u2019s programming because it had become \\u201ca cause of public concern.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cRTHK is a public service broadcaster but not a spokesman of the government,\\u201d the statement said. \\u201cRTHK aspires to be the most credible source of news and public information for the Hong Kong community.\\u201d\", \"For proof of RTHK\\u2019s past willingness to flout the government, viewers needed look no further than Mr. Tsang\\u2019s satirical television show, \\u201cHeadliner.\\u201d One recurring sketch featured the character of a domineering empress, who stood in for leaders ranging from Mr. Xi to Mrs. Lam. Though the show received complaints from government supporters, top editors insulated the staff, Mr. Tsang said.\", \"Last year, \\u201cHeadliner\\u201d became a harbinger of the new RTHK. Executives suspended the show after the Hong Kong police complained about an episode mocking the force.\", \"A few months later, the police arrested the producer of an investigation into the authorities\\u2019 delayed response to a 2019 mob attack on protesters. Then, in February, officials released a report denouncing RTHK\\u2019s \\u201cseriously inadequate\\u201d editorial practices. They announced that the top editor, a veteran journalist, would be replaced by Mr. Li, a civil servant with no journalistic background.\", \"Mr. Li immediately began requiring producers on new programs or potentially \\u201ccontentious\\u201d episodes to submit detailed proposals to a nine-person leadership committee.\", \"The proposal form, according to two people who reviewed the document, asks whether complaints have ever been lodged against the producer; for a description of potentially controversial content, including background music; and for information about guests, including whether they are \\u201cknown to be associated\\u201d with \\u201cradical political groups.\\u201d\", \"Six shows have stopped airing since Mr. Li took over, ranging from a weekly roundtable for social scientists to a nightly travel and leisure program that made way for mainland dramas.\", \"Another discontinued show was \\u201cThe Pulse,\\u201d a current affairs program that went viral after a World Health Organization official was asked in an interview whether Taiwan should be a member. (China, which claims Taiwan as its territory, has shut it out of the body.)\", \"When taping the final episode of \\u201cThe Pulse\\u201d this summer, the host, Steve Vines, signed off saying, \\u201cIn these uncertain times, who knows what will happen in the future. But for now, goodbye and good luck.\\u201d\", \"That was cut before airing.\", \"Others did not even have the chance to try to say farewell. Leung Kai-chi, who co-hosted the social scientist roundtable, received a WhatsApp message at 8:36 p.m. the night before a scheduled taping.\", \"\\u201cManagement says that starting in July, RTHK Channel 31 will have an all-new campaign, and there will be new programming arrangements,\\u201d said the message, which was sent from a producer to the co-hosts and which Mr. Leung shared with The Times. \\u201cWe were told to immediately stop production.\\u201d\", \"The hosts immediately replied: \\u201cTake care.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe understand how much pressure they\\u2019re under,\\u201d Mr. Leung said.\", \"Shows still running are unrecognizable to those who made them.\", \"During Fanny Kwan\\u2019s 13 years producing the news program \\u201cHong Kong Connection,\\u201d she steadily turned out episodes, interviewing exiled Chinese dissidents and parents of autistic children. But when Mr. Li arrived, the new editorial committee vetoed a story, about student activists, she had been filming for weeks. Two other episodes by colleagues were also scrapped.\", \"Ms. Kwan and other producers then strategized over crafting proposals that would pass muster, but two more pitches were rejected: one about commemorations of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and the other a follow-up to the 2019 mob attack.\", \"Ms. Kwan suspected the rejections had as much to do with her team as with the topics. Not long after rebuffing her student activism episode, executives tapped outside contractors to make their own \\u201cHong Kong Connection\\u201d episodes.\", \"While Ms. Kwan and her colleagues waited, sometimes for weeks, to hear back on their proposals, the new team churned out episodes on topics like electric vehicles and Chinese lion dances.\", \"Since April, just five episodes of \\u201cHong Kong Connection\\u201d have been produced by the original team. No episodes touched on the political crackdown.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s our story,\\u201d Ms. Kwan said of the crackdown. \\u201cIf Patrick Li didn\\u2019t come, I think we\\u2019d have been very, very busy.\\u201d\", \"Another political show, \\u201cLegCo Review,\\u201d was outsourced after executives accused the producers of violating the approval process. A forum with candidates in December\\u2019s legislative election was reassigned from the Public and Current Affairs department to Infotainment and Variety, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.\", \"Steering clear of politics is no guarantee of approval either.\", \"In August, Kong Yiu-Wing, an artist, received an interview request from an RTHK arts program about his exhibit \\u201cHong Kongers Archive of 100 Objects,\\u201d a collection of artifacts exploring Hong Kong identity.\", \"Mr. Kong was apprehensive. Pro-Beijing figures have attacked the idea of a discrete Hong Kong identity as unpatriotic, and Mr. Kong was unsure how the new RTHK would treat the topic. \", \"When he met with the producers, they asked technical questions about his process. They did not film more politically tinged artifacts in the exhibit, like copies of pro-Beijing and pro-democracy newspapers, focusing instead on vintage recording equipment.\", \"The day before the air date, an RTHK staffer called Mr. Kong to tell him the program had been scrapped by higher-ups.\", \"\\u201cI really never would have expected this,\\u201d Mr. Kong said. \\u201cBasically every political topic that we could avoid, we already avoided.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Li has defended his decisions as \\u201cvery normal\\u201d editorial processes. Meeting with legislators in May, he acknowledged blocking episodes but said editorial independence did not mean independence for individual production teams. \", \"Even pro-Beijing lawmakers questioned his approach. \\u201cPeople will worry that what you\\u2019re doing is a bit overdone,\\u201d one lawmaker, Chan Kin-por, said.\", \"Most staffers interviewed said they had been drawn to RTHK by its mission. As a public broadcaster, they said, RTHK often made educational or socially conscious programs that commercial broadcasters wouldn\\u2019t. Though funding came from the government, an ethos was instilled in all new hires: RTHK\\u2019s bosses were the people of Hong Kong.\", \"Many journalists spent their entire careers at RTHK. \\u201cPeople used to talk about working for RTHK as a dream job,\\u201d Mr. Leung, the former social science roundtable host, said.\", \"Now, paranoia pervades the headquarters. The new staff guidelines stipulate that all editorial decisions are confidential; breaches may warrant punishment. Communication with higher-ups must be done through a strict hierarchy; individual producers do not speak directly with the editorial committee. Episodes more than one year old have been deleted from RTHK\\u2019s website.\", \"About one-third of the Public and Current Affairs department has departed. Three senior executives left within two weeks of Mr. Li\\u2019s appointment. Mr. Li has a new deputy \\u2014 a transfer from the Marine Department.\", \"Ms. Kwan, of \\u201cHong Kong Connection,\\u201d has left, too. In July, she held a goodbye party with eight other colleagues who had agreed to quit together \\u2014 in part to avoid having too many farewell events.\", \"For a few months afterward, Ms. Kwan texted ex-colleagues still at the station to ask how they were doing. Eventually, she stopped.\", \"\\u201cBecause I can sense that nothing changed there, really,\\u201d she said. \\u201cNothing better. Even worse.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"58da744643a411eca20225c0a817161b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"58da744643a411eca20225c0a817161b"}},
