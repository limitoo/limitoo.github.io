Players begin by guessing any five-letter word.\", \"Wardle said he had \\\"really got into\\\" The New York Times crossword and spelling games during the pandemic.\", \"The New York Times' games, Wardle said, played a \\\"big part\\\" in Wordle's origins, \\\"so this step feels very natural\\\".\", \"In January, Wardle, who engineered games for social-media platform Reddit, told the BBC's Today programme he had come up with a prototype for the game in 2013 but his friends had not been keen on it.\", \"\\\"Last year, my partner and I got really into crosswords and word games and I wanted a game for us to play each morning as part of our routine,\\\" he said.\", \"He then shared it with his family on WhatsApp before opening it up to the public.\", \"Asked whether he planned to make money from it, he said: \\\"I don't understand why something can't just be fun. I don't have to charge people money for this and ideally would like to keep it that way.\\\"\", \"-BBC\"]","href_hash":"e2519016839011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e2519016839011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
