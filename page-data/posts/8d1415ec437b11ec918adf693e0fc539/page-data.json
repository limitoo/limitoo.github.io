We know that it is currently confined to one family and one household. But as the day goes on more interviews are undertaken, more investigations are done and the public health team would update their information.\\\"\", \"He said it was similar to the situation in Christchurch at the beginning of October.\", \"\\\"For now we're working on that basis, but we continue to listen to the advice that we get.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/133738/eight_col_12-dpt-covid007.jpg?1636680450\\\" alt=\\\"Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nGrant Robertson at today's media conference \\nPhoto: Pool / Stuff / Robert Kitchin\\n</div>\", \"Robertson said six DHBs have now hit the 90 percent mark for first doses and some others - like South Canterbury and Hutt Valley - are very close. He said people in those areas could get vaccinated this weekend to push their DHB past that milestone.\", \"He said the vaccine requirement for health and education workers starts next week and he wanted to thank the \\\"vast bulk\\\" who have already been vaccinated.\", \"He says Cabinet had only chosen to make vaccination mandatory in the highest-risk settings. In education, under-12s cannot get vaccinated but they can get Covid-19.\", \"\\\"In fact about 20 percent of the cases in the Delta outbreak have been children aged under 12, including babies.\\\"\", \"He said this was part of the reason to get vaccinated - to protect those who could not. The same applied to healthcare workers.\", \"\\\"Vaccine requirements have been commonly used overseas. They work. And they're a key part of the vaccination drive in those countries with high rates of vaccination that we're trying to match.\\\"\", \"He said vaccine certificates are in the very near future and so far 700,000 New Zealanders have created an account on My Covid Record. He encouraged anyone who has not done so to create a record today.\", \"\\\"This is where that vaccine certificate will land shortly,\\\" he said.\", \"Robertson also said the new resurgence support payment was now open for applications. It is now a double payment calculated weekly, paid fortnightly, at a rate of $3000 and $800 per FTE, up to a maximum of $43,000 per business. The wage subsidy also continues to be available.\", \"Some $5.5bn has been paid out in economic support since the current outbreak began, he said.\"]","href_hash":"8d1415ec437b11ec918adf693e0fc539"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8d1415ec437b11ec918adf693e0fc539"}},
