It's why cigarettes cost $50 a pack and the state government has been handing out $100 holiday vouchers.\", \"It's also an indication of what will happen when the state reaches the 80 per cent vaccination milestone, which is expected somewhere between December 6 and 12.\", \"To enter the state from a hotspot and avoid hotel quarantine you will need to be fully vaccinated and produce a negative COVID test.\", \"If you say you're not showing symptoms of COVID the test is not covered by Medicare, so you have to stump up the entire amount \\u2013 about $150.\", \"Some prospective tourists may lie and say they're symptomatic to avoid paying the fee (which illustrates the point that price affects behaviour) but let's give Australians the benefit of the doubt and assume everyone is honest.\", \"There is also a big exemption for border zone residents. They do not need a test, even those who are unvaccinated, if crossing the border for \\\"essential purposes\\\" such as work, medical care or grocery shopping.\", \"What about for things that are not \\\"essential\\\"? Or other Queenslanders who may want to, say, skip across the border for a weekend in Byron Bay?\", \"The post-80 per cent rules mean they would need to get a $150 COVID test in Byron and hope to get the result back in enough time for the return journey.\", \"Queensland Health is now pumping the brakes and considering tinkering with the plan.\", \"\\\"There may be less testing requirements for fully vaccinated people entering the border zone or entering Queensland from the border zone for non-essential reasons,\\\" a spokesperson said in a statement.\", \"Acting Chief Health Officer\\u00a0Peter Aitken\\u00a0was more explicit about the possibilities when quizzed at a media conference on Friday.\", \"\\\"There may be no test, it may be a\\u00a0free test. We don't know at the moment. We are talking to New South Wales, talking to other colleagues and we'll let you know when there's a decision,\\\" he said.\", \"If you're making travel plans, keep in mind things could change ahead of a border opening that could be just days away.\", \"Then there's the impact on prospective tourists coming into Queensland. An interstate family of four who might be thinking about taking the kids to Sea World this Christmas now has to accommodate into their budget $600 worth of COVID tests (this includes anyone in the family aged one and over).\", \"If the Queensland government was hoping that its recent Holiday Dollars campaign \\u2014 which included $100 travel vouchers for the Gold Coast \\u2014 would be an incentive for travel then it stands to reason that a $150 COVID test would be a disincentive to choosing Queensland as a destination.\", \"The Deputy Premier concedes \\\"it would be a consideration\\\" for tourists but said he made no apologies for requiring the test. He then called for the tests to become free.\", \"\\\"I'd urge the Commonwealth to consider that these tests are part of our wider health response and so therefore be eligible for a Medicare rebate,\\\" he said.\", \"Maybe the government had been planning on making this request for some time but it seemed off-the-cuff. But an hour later when we asked the same question of Environment Minister\\u00a0Meaghan Scanlon\\u00a0on the Gold Coast, it seemed now a government position.\", \"\\\"I definitely think that the Commonwealth should be making it more accessible for people to get those PCR tests,\\\" Ms Scanlon said.\", \"The rejection from the office of the federal Health Minister Greg Hunt came by the end of the day.\", \"\\\"The Commonwealth funds 100 per cent of Medicare funded tests and 50 per cent of state-based tests. It is a\\u00a0surprise that Queensland is seeking to walk away from their responsibilities and their own decision, reducing their own expenditure on COVID safety,\\\" a spokesman said.\", \"In short, each side has decided it's not in their job description to pay for your holiday COVID test. Let's see what behaviour flows from that decision.\"]","href_hash":"9bad4e22497f11eca4cd4319b5daee05"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9bad4e22497f11eca4cd4319b5daee05"}},
