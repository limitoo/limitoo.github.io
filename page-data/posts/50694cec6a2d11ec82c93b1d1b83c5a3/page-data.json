At the end of them, he cheerily said: \\u201cThey call it Times Square for a reason.\\u201d\", \"Carr\\u2019s point was that many people don\\u2019t know that the square is named for the newspaper. New York City changed the name from Longacre Square in 1904, in honor of The Times moving its offices there.\", \"Adolph Ochs, who was the publisher of The Times at the time, celebrated the move by staging a New Year\\u2019s Eve fireworks display in the square. He organized the first midnight ball drop three years later, a tradition that continues even though The Times no longer occupies the building at the center of the square.\", \"This year\\u2019s celebrations will be muted as coronavirus cases surge. Attendance will be limited to 15,000 people instead of the usual 58,000. Paris, Los Angeles and other cities are also downsizing their celebrations.\", \"Today, we\\u2019re looking back. We focused on past New Year\\u2019s events that resonated in this unusual year.\", \"The Times\\u2019s first New Year\\u2019s: The newspaper, founded in September 1851, covered its first New Year\\u2019s Eve less than four months later. It advertised religious ceremonies \\u201cappropriate to the close of the year\\u201d and stores selling New Year\\u2019s presents. On Jan. 1, the paper listed the past year\\u2019s notable deaths and \\u201cprincipal events,\\u201d including a gale that struck Massachusetts, a world\\u2019s fair in London and a coup in France.\", \"The Civil War: On Dec. 30, 1862, Union troops near Murfreesboro, Tenn., played \\u201cYankee Doodle\\u201d and \\u201cHail Columbia.\\u201d Their Confederate foes answered with \\u201cDixie,\\u201d and the two sides ended the night playing \\u201cHome, Sweet Home\\u201d together. The battle that followed, fought between New Year\\u2019s Eve and Jan. 2, 1863, was among the war\\u2019s deadliest.\", \"Also on New Year\\u2019s Eve 1862, abolitionists held vigils as they waited for President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation. He did so the next day, freeing enslaved people in the states that had seceded from the Union. The vigils became the origin of the New Year\\u2019s Eve services that some African American churches still hold.\", \"World War I: America entered World War I in 1917, and Times Square on New Year\\u2019s Eve that year was \\u201cthoroughly sedate and solemn,\\u201d The Times reported. Soldiers and sailors, forbidden to drink, sat in restaurants and hotels. Sugar was rationed, and dinner at the Waldorf Astoria was meatless. Broadway, \\u201cankle-deep in confetti\\u201d a year before, was \\u201cgloomy, deserted and silent.\\u201d\", \"Flu pandemic: New Year\\u2019s Eve 1918 also took place during a pandemic. A brutal fall and winter wave had killed tens of thousands of Americans. By Dec. 31, some cities had loosened their public health measures, inviting a more joyous holiday. \\u201cHotels and clubs and other places where revelers congregate to greet the new year are overdoing themselves in the way of entertainment,\\u201d The Chicago Daily News reported.\", \"And an image that may resonate in 2021: At a Milwaukee hotel ball, dancers wore masks as prescribed by the health department.\", \"World War II: New Year\\u2019s Eve 1941 \\u2014 less than a month after the U.S. joined World War II \\u2014 found Times Square upbeat and patriotic. More than half a million people cheered and sang the national anthem under Broadway\\u2019s neon lights. \\u201cIf Axis ears did not hear last night\\u2019s revelry in Times Square it was not that New Yorkers didn\\u2019t try,\\u201d The Times reported the next day.\", \"Still, the square featured a robust police presence, street signs with evacuation instructions and loudspeakers in the event of an air raid. And later wartime holidays were less festive. Because of the \\u201cdim outs\\u201d meant to conceal the city from a possible attack, 1942 and 1943 were the only New Year\\u2019s Eves since 1907 that did not feature Times Square ball drops.\", \"Transition to television: Today, most people experience New Year\\u2019s Eve in Times Square as a television show with musical interludes. The Canadian-born musician Guy Lombardo and his band, the Royal Canadians, were early pioneers. They broadcast over the radio starting in the 1920s and, in later decades, on television, an example Dick Clark, Carson Daly and others built on. This year, too, live television will be flush with celebrity-driven countdowns. If you\\u2019ll be ringing in the New Year from home, here\\u2019s what to watch.\", \"Related:\", \"Kara Swisher makes her tech predictions for 2022.\", \"The year\\u2019s best long-form journalism, according to David Brooks.\", \"Sustainability: Can a tiny territory in the South Pacific power Tesla\\u2019s ambitions?\", \"Tech: Are Apple\\u2019s AirTags being used to track people and steal cars?\", \"Mom\\u2019s Spaghetti: A night at Eminem\\u2019s restaurant in Detroit.\", \"Behind the scenes: Walk through the history of our weekly news quiz.\", \"In case you missed it: Take the Great News Quiz of 2021 or test your knowledge of the year\\u2019s notable people.\", \"Modern Love: Eight Tiny Love Stories about fresh starts.\", \"Lives Lived: For four decades, Ben McFall incarnated the erudite but easygoing spirit of Manhattan\\u2019s Strand bookstore.
