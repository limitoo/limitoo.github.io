The team\\u2019s trades have left the Rams without any first-round selections until 2024 and only four picks in the next draft, the earliest of which is in the third round.\", \"\\u201cYou have to be aware of what window you\\u2019re in,\\u201d Snead said.\", \"Even before Miller\\u2019s arrival, the Rams (7-1) were viewed as a Super Bowl favorite, with a defensive unit that leads the league in sacks (25). The trade made clear that Los Angeles, which will host the Super Bowl in its home stadium this season, is in \\u201cwin-now\\u201d mode.\", \"But the team\\u2019s willingness to give up draft capital limits its ability to extend that window in the cheapest way possible \\u2014 by developing players into starters while they are on rookie contracts.\", \"Since trading up 14 spots to select quarterback Jared Goff with the No. 1 overall pick in 2016, Snead and the Rams\\u2019 front office have frequently doled out draft picks to other teams to poach their best assets. They reached the Super Bowl in the 2018 season with Goff, then tried to build around him through trades, most notably acquiring cornerback Jalen Ramsey in 2019 from the Jacksonville Jaguars in exchange for picks, including two in the first-round that year.\", \"When it became clear Goff would not lead Los Angeles back to the championship game, Snead netted Stafford by packaging Goff\\u2019s contract with picks, including two in the first round.\", \"Stafford and Ramsey were top-five selections in their drafts, and the Rams have not been willing to lose enough to be in contention to draft that high. Snead said it has been more valuable to trade picks that would probably have landed in the mid-20s to acquire proven players.\", \"\\u201cThe neat thing about doing it this way is that you\\u2019re not guessing,\\u201d Snead said. \\u201cThe player has lived up to his draft status.\\u201d\", \"There is no mystery about how Miller, the No. 2 overall pick in 2011 and an eight-time Pro Bowl selection, will be expected to perform. The Super Bowl most valuable player in the 2015 season, he has 110\\u00bd sacks in his career and four and a half this season. His presence on a defense with Ramsey and tackle Aaron Donald will further complicate offensive coordinators\\u2019 game scripts and should alleviate double teams of Donald.\", \"The Rams last week traded a starting linebacker, Kenny Young, to the Broncos to free space under the salary cap. Rams Coach Sean McVay told reporters last month that he initially did not think the team would make a splashy move before the trade deadline on Tuesday, but he and Snead pounced on the possibility of trading for Miller.\", \"\\u201cI love the fearlessness, I love the aggressiveness, and that philosophy has been kind of evolving and ongoing,\\u201d McVay told reporters on Monday of his relationship with Snead.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re not afraid of whatever those consequences are because we\\u2019re going to attack the opportunities to be successful,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThat\\u2019s the mind-set I think we have as an organization, as a team and in our building.\\u201d\", \"Snead and McVay balked at the idea that the team\\u2019s aggressive trade approach meant the organization did not see value in the draft.\", \"\\u201cWe still believe in it, and we feel like you can use it in a very particular way depending on the options we have,\\u201d Snead said.\", \"The Rams have been able to find contributors in later rounds, which they attribute to their scouts finding underrated players and their position coaches developing them.\", \"The team\\u2019s top receiver, Cooper Kupp, a third-round selection in 2018, leads the league in catches (63), yards (924) and touchdowns (10). Receiver Van Jefferson and running back Cam Akers, who tore his Achilles\\u2019 tendon before training camp, were second-round picks in 2020.\", \"\\u201cThere is a formula to a lot of the things that we\\u2019re doing behind the scenes,\\u201d McVay said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a vision in place. And we feel like it fits for us, and it might not be for everybody.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"17984f2e3cd011ec8257000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"17984f2e3cd011ec8257000017025a03"}},
