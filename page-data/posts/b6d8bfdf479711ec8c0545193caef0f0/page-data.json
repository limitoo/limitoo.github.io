Life and death both have to be beautiful, but death has a bad rep. The toad has taught me that I'm not going to be here forever.

This led some people to try to extract it, dry it, and smoke or inhale it,\\\" according to the center.\", \"The poison center said licking toads (usually cane toads) can be dangerous and may cause muscle weakness, rapid heart rate and vomiting.\", \"Toad venom is relatively obscure among psychedelics, according to Alan Davis, a postdoc fellow with the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine's Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit.
