This should never have happened.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Lofton was arrested on Sept. 24 when the police were called to a house in Wichita after he began \\u201cexhibiting erratic and aggressive behavior\\u201d toward his foster family, according to an autopsy report from the Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Science Center.\", \"The police took Mr. Lofton to a county juvenile center, where he fought with correctional staff members, who placed shackles on his ankles, rolled him onto his abdomen and handcuffed his wrists behind his back, the report said. He appeared to calm down and made \\u201csnoring sounds,\\u201d but when staff members checked for a pulse four minutes later, they could not find one, the report said.\", \"Mr. Lofton did not regain consciousness and died two days later, according to the report, which was filed in Sedgwick County District Court last month.\", \"The decision not to file charges devastated the family, Andrew Stroth, a Chicago-based lawyer who is representing the teenager\\u2019s biological parents and his older brother, said in an interview on Tuesday. Mr. Bennett\\u2019s rationale doesn\\u2019t make sense given that Mr. Lofton was unarmed, weighed 135 pounds and posed no threat, said Mr. Stroth, who is representing the family along with Steven Hart, another lawyer in Chicago.\", \"Officials put Mr. Lofton \\u201cin a restraint system and then later in a prone position, and they basically took Cedric\\u2019s breath away and killed him,\\u201d Mr. Stroth said.\", \"\\u201cThe idea of a stand-your-ground defense or immunity makes absolutely no sense based on the facts in this case,\\u201d he added.\", \"A spokesman said on Tuesday that Mr. Bennett would have no further comment.\", \"In his report, Mr. Bennett explained the robustness of the state\\u2019s stand-your-ground law. Kansas appellate courts, he wrote, have held that people have the right to shoot an unarmed assailant who was punching them in the face; stab an unarmed neighbor with a sword after being threatened and followed into one\\u2019s own garage; and shoot an unarmed man in the back based on the belief that he was running to a car to retrieve a gun.\", \"Mr. Bennett wrote that there was no evidence that throughout the struggle, which lasted 35 minutes or so, workers had discerned that Mr. Lofton was in physical distress. The evidence suggests that Mr. Lofton continued to resist throughout the struggle, meaning that the staff members could continue to \\u201clawfully apply restraint,\\u201d Mr. Bennett wrote.\", \"Mr. Lofton continued to make statements that led staff to believe \\u201che was either under the influence of drugs or having a mental health crisis,\\u201d Mr. Bennett wrote. Staff members reported that no one\\u2019s \\u201cfull weight\\u201d had been placed on Mr. Lofton as he lay prone, and video shows the adults appearing to kneel or lie down next to Mr. Lofton, Mr. Bennett wrote.\", \"The employees in the county Corrections Department who were involved in the encounter had been placed on paid administrative leave while the results of the district attorney\\u2019s investigation were being awaited, Sedgwick County officials have said. The employees\\u2019 status has not changed, a county spokesman, Akeam Ashford, said late Tuesday. Mr. Ashford said there had been no disciplinary action related to the death of Mr. Lofton.\", \"A medical examiner determined that the cause of death was homicide. \\u201cIn my opinion,\\u201d the medical examiner, Dr. Timothy S. Gorrill, wrote last month, \\u201cCedric Lofton died as a result of complications of cardiopulmonary arrest sustained after physical struggle while restrained in the prone position.\\u201d\", \"That finding came several months after Jeff Easter, the county sheriff, said in September that a preliminary autopsy had found that Mr. Lofton did not experience life-threatening injuries at the center.\", \"In an email to news organizations after Dr. Gorrill\\u2019s report was released, Mr. Bennett wrote that the determination that the death was a homicide \\u201cdoes not reflect a legal determination\\u201d regarding the viability of criminal charges.\", \"\\u201cWhether or not criminal charges can be brought is a separate, legal determination to be made by the Office of the District Attorney based on the laws of the State of Kansas and the evidence collected by law enforcement,\\u201d he wrote.\", \"Mr. Lofton was a high school senior and planned to move to California after graduation to pursue a musical career, Mr. Stroth said.\", \"Maurice W. Evans, a local pastor, said the death of Mr. Lofton represented a community failure. Mr. Lofton\\u2019s foster father had locked him out of the house that night and had called the police, Mr. Evans said. Police officers treated the teenager like a criminal rather than as someone experiencing a mental-health crisis, he said, and detention staff members improperly restrained him.\", \"\\u201cEvery link in the chain failed this young man,\\u201d Mr. Evans said. \\u201cEach individual chain link treated him worse than the previous one until it ended in his death. This was a five-hour ordeal. This kid was killed after five hours of being mentally and physically abused by multiple people in our system.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Stroth said Mr. Lofton\\u2019s family would continue to pursue \\u201call legal avenues to get justice for Cedric,\\u201d but he did not elaborate.\", \"\\u201cFamily and the community and stakeholders in the community are going to continue to fight for justice for Cedric,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re going to continue to fight to make sure people are held accountable for this unjustified killing of an unarmed 17-year-old.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f0e08826794511ecad7dc38473e949de"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f0e08826794511ecad7dc38473e949de"}},
