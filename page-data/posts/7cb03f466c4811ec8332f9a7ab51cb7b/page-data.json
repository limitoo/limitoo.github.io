About a quarter of all flights at O'Hare Airport were canceled Sunday.\", \"Denver's airport also faced significant disruptions. Enos, who was flying on Frontier Airlines, didn't learn that her connecting flight home to California was canceled until she had already landed in Denver. Then it was a rush to find alternative flights and navigate through baggage claims packed with stranded and confused travelers, amid concerns about the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of COVID-19.\", \"\\\"It was a lot of people in a very small space and not everybody was masking,\\\" said the 28-year-old financial analyst. \\\"There were a lot of exhausted kids and some families were so stressed out.\\\"\", \"In Michigan, the authority that runs Detroit International Airport said crews were working around the clock to remove snow and maintain the airfield.

United is offering to pay pilots triple or more of their usual wages for picking up open flights through most of January. Spirit Airlines reached a deal with the Association of Flight Attendants for double pay for cabin crews through Tuesday, a union spokesperson said.\", \"Airlines hope that extra pay and reduced schedules get them through the holiday crush and into the heart of January, when travel demand usually drops off.
