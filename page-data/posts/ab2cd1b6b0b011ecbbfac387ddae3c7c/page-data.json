The government has to act swiftly and decisively, we will always look at those decisions again and in hindsight we may make slightly different decisions.\", \"\\\"But overall I stand by the fact that the tourism industry needed support, there were significant issues for, particularly, operators that were very significant for their town or their region and we had to act.\", \"\\\"In every town and every city there are tourism businesses that play a significant role in economic development, the government was acting at a time when we needed to move quickly and swiftly and I believe that we've supported tourism businesses that are important to the industry.\\\"\", \"Ryan noted the scheme was designed to be delivered at speed in a changing environment, but criticised a lack of transparency and accountability.\", \"\\\"Trust and confidence in government depends on transparency and accountability when spending public money,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Trust and confidence can be undermined where the criteria are not clear and when some applicants are treated, or are perceived to be treated, differently than most applicants or where there is limited documentation supporting decisions made by ministers.
