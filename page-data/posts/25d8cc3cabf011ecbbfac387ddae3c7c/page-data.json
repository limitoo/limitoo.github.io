Particularly with deaths, it means a loss for people, for family and friends.\", \"\\\"[A simple death count] is a key indicator that a disease ... is having an impact.\", \"\\\"But when you're looking at some trends in a more meaningful way, particularly if you're comparing countries, you'll want to convert that to a death rate or mortality rate, and that's usually expressed as deaths per 100,000 or deaths per million per year.\\\"\", \"But mortality rates can be expressed in different ways, he says.\", \"\\\"Broadly, they're essential for comparing the mortality impact across countries which have very different populations, and it wouldn't make sense to compare the number across countries ... you need a rate.\\\"\", \"A mortality rate is also good for comparing geographic areas - district health boards in Aotearoa for example - or demographics - age groups or ethnicities.\", \"Essentially, any comparison in a meaningful way requires rates rather than counts, Baker says.\", \"Then there are the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Infection Fatality Risk (IFR) - they are different measures of the same thing.\", \"Baker says the CFR is simply \\\"If you become a case, what's your chance of dying from it?\\\" In other terms - the number of deaths divided by the number of cases.\", \"Plank also points out that with the CFR, it's subject to how much testing is being done, and \\\"you have to remember the death lag behind cases\\\".\", \"\\\"We might be just about over our peak of cases, but it's likely that death will continue to rise because they lag behind, so actually most of our deaths are probably still to come.\", \"\\\"That makes our CFR at the moment appear to be lower than what it will probably end up.\\\"\", \"\\\"But that (the CFR) is actually not the most important number,\\\" Baker says. This is where the IFR comes in. In short IFR calculates: \\\"If you get infected with this virus, what's your chance of dying\\\".\", \"Or to put it another way, the number of people who have died relative to the total number of people who've been infected (not just the number of infections recorded).\", \"Infection Fatality Risk (IFR) is more important, Baker says, but it's harder to calculate. That's because it's based on everyone you think was infected - not just recorded cases.\", \"\\\"Basically the only way you can work out how many people got infected is with research studies ... to say 'yeah, we think in New Zealand that half the country got infected' ... and you might say, well, only one in five actually identified and reported it.\", \"\\\"This happens all the time with infectious diseases ... so figuring out the IFR, the infection risk is important, but it's really difficult to do.\\\"\", \"So to recap - there are three main measures for deaths - count data, population mortality and CFR/IFR.\", \"Baker notes that there is a difference between rates or risks when it comes to Case Fatality Rate and Infection Fatality Risk - rates are expressed over a set time period (a year for example) and a denominator (say per 100,000) and risk is a probability of a bad outcome - there's no population or time and is usually expressed as a percentage.\", \"This is another metric worth noting, Baker says.\", \"\\\"For much of the world they don't have very good high quality health systems, so they under-count. They don't have a lot of resources to put into testing people, so quite often if someone isn't tested before they die, they won't be counted as Covid deaths.\", \"\\\"So there's a huge underreporting of Covid deaths and will also be some deliberate underreporting, but the metric that's used to try and give a handle on that is excess deaths.\\\"\", \"Calculating excess mortality rates is a good way of double-checking on earlier measures to ensure they're correct, Baker says.\", \"Our World In Data says excess deaths or excess mortality is \\\"measured as the difference between the reported number of deaths in a given week or month (depending on the country)\\\".\", \"A report on Nature.com in January said global Covid-19 excess deaths were estimated at double or even quadruple the 5 million-odd reported deaths.\", \"Plank says \\\"basically you (look at) the total number of people who are dying for any reason - is that higher or lower than what you would typically see in a normal year pre-Covid?\\\"\", \"It is calculated as excess deaths = reported deaths - expected deaths.\", \"\\\"So you can look at this as an indicator of - is the fact that we're in a pandemic adding to our total mortality with total number of people who are dying?\", \"\\\"It's different at the moment, but over the last couple of years New Zealand has in fact had less deaths, whereas you know, most countries who've had big Covid waves have had a lot more deaths than normal because so many people have died from Covid.\\\"\", \"In fact, Aotearoa's excess deaths are currently negative - potentially a result of reduced mortality due to a reduction in things like seasonal influenza due to Covid-19 health measures. That's not the case for most of the world.\", \"Plank says the excess deaths metric is probably going to become more important going forward.\", \"\\\"A we move to a situation where Covid is endemic - it's not going away - what is important is the health burden that it's creating relative to other infectious diseases and other causes of death or causes of illness.\", \"\\\"So I think that context of excess mortality will start to become more important. I mean, on average New Zealand in a normal year has about 100 deaths per day - that's a very very ballpark figure, and of course that will vary a lot between summer and winter, and it will vary from year to year depending if you have a bad flu season, for example, but that gives you an idea of the, you know, what is a sort of normal background level of mortality for New Zealand.\\\"\", \"That Nature article also points out another challenge, which relates to the next subject we'll discuss: \\\"Working out (excess deaths) is a complex research challenge. It is not as simple as just counting up each country's excess mortality figures. Some official data in this regard are flawed, scientists have found. And more than 100 countries do not collect reliable statistics on expected or actual deaths at all, or do not release them in a timely manner.\\\"\", \"Our mortality rate has skyrocketed recently.\", \"After holding steady at about five per million from early 2020 until late last year, it jumped to about 10 per million for several months - until February 2022.\", \"Since then, it has gone rapidly up to reach close to 40 deaths per million.\", \"We're in the middle of the pack when it comes to mortality rates internationally, Plank says.\", \"\\\"We're sort of sitting in the middle of a bunch of countries like Germany, UK, Switzerland and the USA ... in the two to four deaths per million per day (range).\\\"\", \"But overall, our deaths are still low compared to many countries because we avoided massive death tolls recorded in other countries over the past two years, Plank says.\", \"As for the coming weeks and months, Baker says \\\"there's a lag of deaths and we first see the peak of cases, then we see a peak of hospitalisations, and then we see a peak of deaths after that, and there's lags of several weeks in there.\", \"\\\"That's why early on we saw hundreds of thousands of cases, but not many deaths, but they're catching up now unfortunately, and they're tracking up and they'll be in that 10 to 20 range for several weeks.\\\"\", \"At the moment, Omicron appears to be peaking in New Zealand as a whole.\", \"It peaked in Auckland about two weeks ago and much of the North Island about a week ago, and for the rest of the North Island and the South Island it may be peaking mid-late this week, Baker says.\", \"\\\"The hospitalisations in Auckland peaked about two weeks after cases, but the rest of New Zealand is just still peaking in cases so I think will be another two weeks from now before hospitalisations peak.\", \"\\\"And the deaths generally peak about two weeks after that so I would say we'll see peak mortality within the next month, probably for New Zealand as a whole.\", \"\\\"But those waves will take until the end of late April ... deaths will stay at a raised level right through until May, probably.\\\"\", \"Plank says there will be \\\"quite a lot\\\" of variability in daily numbers of deaths recorded.\", \"He says we are likely to end up with deaths \\\"in the hundreds\\\" from the Omicron wave.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/262909/eight_col_high_WYNTK-LOGO-BANNER_%281%29.jpg?1620365910\\\" alt=\\\"No metadata\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\"]","href_hash":"25d8cc3cabf011ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"25d8cc3cabf011ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
