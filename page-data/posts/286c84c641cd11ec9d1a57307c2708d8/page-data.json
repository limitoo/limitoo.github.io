The curator and writer Su Wu, who has lived in Mexico City, some 280 miles northwest, since 2017, had brought the group together to celebrate, too, the boundary-breaking Cuban-born artist Ana Mendieta\\u2019s \\u201cSiluetas\\u201d series of photographs and films (1973-78), from which five works appear in the inaugural show at La Cl\\u00ednica, a onetime medical office that was recently reimagined by Ram\\u00f3n Jim\\u00e9nez Cu\\u00e9n, the former director of the Museo de Arte Contempor\\u00e1neo de Oaxaca, as an unconventional exhibition venue.\", \"The show marks the first time these works from the series \\u2014 a turning point not only in Mendieta\\u2019s career but also within the wider contexts of performance and feminist art \\u2014 are on view in the area in which they were created. \\u201cMendieta grew up partly in exile, in the United States, and this was her first time returning to a Spanish-speaking place,\\u201d Wu said of the artist\\u2019s pivotal trip to Mexico in 1973, during which she traveled to Oaxaca to visit pre-Columbian archaeological sites and to learn about Indigenous spiritual practices, capturing her interactions with the region in photographs and films (including several \\u201cSiluetas\\u201d) that explore themes of both violence and transcendence. \\u201cThe circumstances of her death have overshadowed the significance of her life and the work she made,\\u201d said Wu. (Mendieta died in New York in 1985, at age 36; her husband, the sculptor Carl Andre, was charged with second degree murder but later acquitted.) \\u201cAnd I especially wanted to celebrate the work she made in Oaxaca,\\u201d Wu continued.\", \"To organize the exhibition, titled \\u201cElementos Vitales: Ana Mendieta in Oaxaca,\\u201d Wu joined forces with Masa, a nomadic gallery that bridges the worlds of art and design, and presents experimental shows in unusual, often disused spaces. In addition to the \\u201cSiluetas\\u201d films, there are also pieces by five contemporary artists \\u2014 all Latinx or living in Mexico \\u2014 whom Wu selected to create site-specific installations that engage with Mendieta\\u2019s work. Wu explained that the artist\\u2019s oeuvre has an intensity and universality to it that has long elicited a wide range of responses. \\u201cA lot has been written about her,\\u201d she said, \\u201cand that writing changes in different eras, as people project onto her what they need.\\u201d The acclaimed Mexican architect Frida Escobedo answered Wu\\u2019s prompt by creating an elegant chain-draped bench to complement Mendieta\\u2019s 1974 Super 8 film \\u201cCreek,\\u201d which shows the artist nude and adrift in a pool of water. In another room, the Mexico City-based artist Adeline de Monseignat installed half-moon-shaped travertine seats in front of a projection of Mendieta\\u2019s beautiful but unnerving film \\u201cOcean Bird (Washup)\\u201d (1974) \\u2014 in which the artist, covered in white feathers, is seen bobbing along a shoreline \\u2014 and blanketed the floor with pebbles.\", \"\\u201cI think there\\u2019s a special sensation when you see things in the place they\\u2019re made,\\u201d said Yola Jimenez, a founder of Yola Mezcal, who traveled from her home in Mexico City to see the show and provided locally distilled mezcal for the comal-cooked opening brunch, served in La Cl\\u00ednica\\u2019s leafy courtyard. The food, which in honoring Oaxacan culinary traditions, was its own creative testament to place, and was the work of chef Thalia Barrios Garcia of the nearby restaurant Levadura de Olla. Garcia learned from her grandmother how to construct a traditional ceramic comal \\u2014 a flat, smooth griddle typically made from sandstone or earthenware \\u2014 as well as how to make Oaxacan-style tamales, which are characterized by their fluffy dough and large, squarish shape. Mole-stuffed versions of the latter featured on the menu alongside an array of other seasonal, fire-roasted dishes including griddled corn tostadas and charred tomatoes, as well as frijoles de la olla (brothy beans cooked in a pot). \\u201cThere are a lot of physical and spiritual benefits to cooking with clay,\\u201d Garcia said. \\u201cTo be in contact with clay is to be in contact with the earth.\\u201d\", \"As Garcia and her team set up their open kitchen in the courtyard, guests wandered in and out of the gallery rooms as others sipped margaritas, mixed with activated charcoal, under a towering mandimbo, or Mexican oak tree. When a local marimba band began to play, everyone sauntered out to the courtyard for the meal. The tamales were served at the tables along with a sharp queso fresco, then guests were invited to walk up to the kitchen, where a procession of nourishing dishes were ladled out directly from atop the comales. Here, Wu and Garcia share their tips for hosting a similarly warm and meaningful gathering.\", \"Fifty years ago, on archaeological sites and monastery complexes around Oaxaca, Mendieta traced her body\\u2019s silhouette with flowers, smoke, mud, shells and blood to create what she called \\u201cearth-body works,\\u201d which she documented in photographs and films, including several \\u201cSiluetas.\\u201d \\u201cWhile macho man artists were carving their mile-long holes in the ground, Mendieta was also using the earth as her canvas \\u2014 but in a much more intimate way,\\u201d said Wu. Garcia\\u2019s cooking practice also comes from a desire to commune with the natural world. To build the kitchen and three comales for this meal, for example, she gathered adobe bricks and wet clay from her hometown, San Mateo Yucutindoo, in the mountains outside Oaxaca City. The clay cooking surfaces not only heat food evenly but also imbue dishes with a layered, earthy flavor.\", \"Wu set up four rows of wooden benches in the building\\u2019s sun-dappled courtyard and some dishes were passed along the tables by the guests to create a communal feel. \\u201cWe built the kitchen in the corner of the yard, expanding to the sides so that everyone could see us,\\u201d explained Garcia, who spent eight months preparing for a series of meals, including this one, that will take place at the gallery, procuring rare ingredients and fresh clay for the cookware. \\u201cWe tried to lay out the adobe bricks and the comales in a way that felt like you were in your grandmother\\u2019s kitchen in a garden,\\u201d Garcia said. \\u201cThere was just earth under our feet.\\u201d Even the tall ceramic dishes used to serve the tostadas were made with family-style proportions in mind: The oval shape allows Garcia to stack many pieces vertically at a time.\", \"Garcia collaborated with a female ceramist in her hometown to design special bowls, cups and plates that would complement the meal\\u2019s dishes. The tamales were served on rough-hewn rounded plates with enough depth to keep them plump and upright, and a mushroom soup arrived in very smooth, hand-size bowls because it contained poleo, a digestive herb that is only meant to be consumed in small portions on account of its potency.\", \"The corn that went into the tostadas and tamales was grown and harvested by Garcia\\u2019s parents just outside their home. \\u201cIt\\u2019s corn season, and in my village, everyone plants their own,\\u201d she said. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t buy it because no one would sell you their own corn. It\\u2019s a very sacred food and it\\u2019s treated with deep respect. We\\u2019re also very happy because mother nature has blessed us with epazote, hoja santa and a lot of other herbs, too.\\u201d Continuing the theme of locally produced ingredients, the drink offering included flower-topped margaritas made with mezcal distilled on Jimenez\\u2019s family agave farm in San Juan del R\\u00edo, Oaxaca.\", \"Garcia served agua de ma\\u00edz, a spiced corn drink, in thick-walled clay pitchers that kept it fresh throughout the day. It was poured into bespoke clay cups shaped like the branches of a pochote tree, which has special resonance in Oaxaca. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a sacred tree with a lot of myths around it,\\u201d said Garcia. Mugs were created in the traditional Oaxacan style with no handles, so that guests could cradle them with both hands and slowly sip hot cafe de olla, or sweet, spiced Mexican coffee.\", \"By working with people whom she admires and who care deeply about Mendieta and this region, Wu was able to host a gathering that was not only convivial but also emotionally resonant. \\u201cI think in Mexico it\\u2019s still quite rare to have a women-run event like this,\\u201d said Jimenez. \\u201cAnd the famous Oaxacan artists are all men, so it was really refreshing to see women\\u2019s work showcased in a way that felt modern and important. I think it\\u2019s why the event had such a different energy. It just felt really joyful.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"286c84c641cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"286c84c641cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
