Companies are reassessing whether they need to rent large office spaces with so few employees coming in. A record number of U.S. workers quit their jobs in September as the \\u201cGreat Resignation\\u201d continues, while thousands more are protesting pay or working conditions.\", \"For insight into how the shifting tides of the pandemic will shape our work lives, I turned to my colleague Emma Goldberg. (She\\u2019s already making waves on her new beat with a look at conflicts in the office between Gen Z and millennials.)\", \"You\\u2019re the new future of work reporter at The Times. What does that mean?\", \"It\\u2019s an exciting beat because it\\u2019s very broad \\u2014 it encompasses everything from the social dynamics of the workplace and the design of the office to whether the office itself has a future. It covers everything from what productivity means and how it\\u2019s assessed, to the public health implications of our return to offices.\", \"Where do things stand with return to office?\", \"A lot of companies were supposed to be back in their offices in July or September, but with the Delta variant\\u2019s surge, there were a lot of postponements. Now, there are companies that are saying they\\u2019re going to be back in offices in January or in early 2022. There\\u2019s a lot of uncertainty right now.\", \"That said, the Biden mandates should make a lot of larger employers and workers feel safer. Some experts are saying that smaller and medium-sized companies are going to follow their lead. So as vaccine mandates roll out over the next 60 days, we may start to see more of those long-elusive reopenings finally starting to pan out.\", \"What trends will shape our work lives in the coming years?\", \"A big one is the question of flexibility. During the pandemic, a lot of companies had to face the fact that some of the norms of the office that have been so fundamental for years aren\\u2019t necessary to produce great work output. In fact, they were making things really challenging for some people. That forced a reckoning among employers about what kind of flexibility could be afforded to workers.\", \"Another trend is the war for talent. Right now, there is a big labor shortage, with record high rates of people leaving their jobs, which makes talent a scarce commodity. That\\u2019s pushing companies to rethink what perks they\\u2019re offering, from raises to other kind of benefits. And that\\u2019s happening across sectors.\", \"There\\u2019s also continued conversations about what companies can do to support the movement for racial justice. Last summer, there was a wave of commitments from companies promising to rethink their diversity, equity and inclusion strategies. Now, a little over a year later, workers are following up and asking how much of it really panned out and what companies are going to do to make good on the initial promises they made.\", \"How has the pandemic changed work culture?\", \"Companies that went remote or hybrid over the last year had to rethink what it means to build culture when workers aren\\u2019t sitting next to each other. For some companies, it has meant organizing virtual holiday parties and pumpkin carvings. Others are having their employees do virtual hikes together, meaning they each separately go on walks but call each other up while doing so. And still others are finding that their workers miss being together in person, and they\\u2019re coming back to their desks to hang out even though it\\u2019s not required.\", \"What about long-term changes to our work lives?\", \"Something I heard from a lot of people over the last year is that the pandemic has forced a reckoning with the premium people place on their careers and on the role of work in their lives. It\\u2019s forced them to question what really makes them happy and how to build a balance between work and life that feels more sustainable. This mentality could prompt a huge shift in how much time and energy we devote to our jobs, or how we draw boundaries between work and life.\", \"C.E.O.s are struggling with how and when to bring employees back to the office \\u2014 or if they even need to bring employees back at all. Many are eager for employees to return, but they\\u2019re also afraid of alienating those who have grown accustomed to working from home. Several bosses spoke with The Times\\u2019s David Gelles:\", \"The new normal\", \"At Upwork, employees are helping to shape company policies and determine the future of their shared office life.\", \"\\u201cI think they do have more power now,\\u201d said Hayden Brown, Upwork\\u2019s chief executive. \\u201cCompanies are listening to their employees more than ever before, and I think that\\u2019s partly because the war for talent is greater than ever.\\u201d\", \"The case for in-person work\", \"For Chris Merrill, a co-founder and the chief executive of Harrison Street, the romanticization of remote work is balderdash.\", \"\\u201cBeing in the office makes sense,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very, very important for the younger people to be together. That is where they learn. That is where they grow. That is where you\\u2019re going to create upward mobility.\\u201d\", \"Downsides of staying remote\", \"Andi Owen, the chief executive of MillerKnoll, warned that workers who resist going back to the office could find themselves isolated and at a disadvantage.\", \"\\u201cOne of my biggest worries is that we\\u2019re going to have remote orphans,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWalking down the hall to somebody\\u2019s office and knocking on the door, or doing a drive-by versus setting up a video appointment, these things are easier to do in person.\\u201d\", \"The benefits of flexibility\", \"Liz Fraser, the chief executive of Kate Spade, worked relentlessly for years and now has an 18-year-old daughter. She said she wished she\\u2019d had more opportunities to work remotely earlier in her career.\", \"\\u201cIt would have been a game changer for me to have had a little bit more flexibility so that I could take my meetings from home in the afternoon,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI definitely traveled a lot and I worked really hard, and I wanted to. I don\\u2019t regret it. But there\\u2019s no such thing as quality time. There\\u2019s just time.\\u201d\", \"Let us know how you\\u2019re dealing with the pandemic.
