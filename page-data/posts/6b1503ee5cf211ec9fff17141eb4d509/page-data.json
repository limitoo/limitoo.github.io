The crisis has accelerated as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has doubled down on his unorthodox policies.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-14T15:28:50.000Z","content":"[\"The signs of Turkey\\u2019s disastrous economy are all around. Long lines snake outside the government\\u2019s subsidized bread kiosks. The price of medicine, milk and toilet paper are soaring. Some gas stations have closed after exhausting their stock. Angry outbursts have erupted on the streets.\", \"\\u201cUnemployment, high living costs, price increases, and bills are breaking our backs,\\u201d the Confederation of Progressive Trade Unions said last month.\", \"Even before the coronavirus pandemic and supply chain bottlenecks began walloping the world\\u2019s economies nearly two years ago, Turkey was trying to ward off a recession as it struggled with mountainous debt, steep losses in the value of the Turkish lira, and rising inflation. But in recent weeks that slow-moving train wreck has sped up with a ferocious intensity. And the foot that\\u2019s pushing hardest on the accelerator belongs to the country\\u2019s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\", \"Turkey\\u2019s economic problems have deep roots but the most recent crisis was caused by Mr. Erdogan\\u2019s insistence on lowering interest rates in the face of galloping inflation \\u2014 precisely the opposite tactic of what economists almost universally prescribe.\", \"Mr. Erdogan, who has ruled Turkey for 18 years, has long resisted that particularly painful prescription, but his determination to keep cutting interest rates even as the country\\u2019s inflation rate tops a staggering 21 percent appears to be pushing Turkey past a tipping point.\", \"Normally, investors and others look to a nation\\u2019s central bank to keep inflation in check and set interest rates. But Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly shown that if Turkey\\u2019s central bankers and finance ministers won\\u2019t do what he wants, he will get rid of them, having already fired three in two years.\", \"The value of the lira has nose-dived in recent weeks, and on Monday hit a record low \\u2014 reaching 14.3 to a dollar, from about 7 to the dollar earlier this year \\u2014 pushing some businesses and households that have borrowed money from abroad into bankruptcy. The currency\\u2019s steep decline means prices for imported goods keeps rising. Shortages are common and people are struggling to afford food and fuel. The youth unemployment rate is 25 percent. The president\\u2019s popularity is sinking and his opponents have become emboldened.\", \"With an election coming up in 18 months, Mr. Erdogan seems convinced that his strategy will enable the Turkish economy to grow out of its problems. Most economists, however, say a crash is more likely.\", \"Mr. Erdogan\\u2019s aggressive pro-growth strategies have worked for him before. Since he began governing Turkey in 2003, he has undertaken expensive infrastructure projects, courted foreign investors and encouraged businesses and consumers to load up on debt. Growth took off.\", \"\\u201cTurkey was considered to be an economic miracle,\\u201d during the first decade of Mr. Erdogan\\u2019s rule, said Kadri Tastan, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund based in Brussels. Poverty was sliced in half, millions of people swelled the ranks of the middle class, and foreign investors were eager to lend.\", \"But Mr. Erdogan\\u2019s relentless push to expand became unsustainable. Rather than pull back, however, the giddy borrowing continued.\", \"The increasingly unstable economy was caught in a bind. High interest rates attracted foreign investors to accept the risk and keep lending, but they would stunt growth. Mr. Erdogan was unwilling to accept that trade-off, and continued to support cheap borrowing as inflation took off and the currency\\u2019s value declined.\", \"And he insists that high interest rates cause inflation \\u2014 even though it is low interest rates that put more money into circulation, encourage people to borrow and spend more, and tend to drive up the prices.\", \"\\u201cErdogan has his own economic philosophy,\\u201d said Henri Barkey, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\", \"The economy seesawed between these conflicting goals until 2018 when growing political tensions between Turkey and the United States caused the value of the lira to topple.\", \"The political standoff eased, but the underlying economic problems remained. Mr. Erdogan kept pushing state banks to offer cheap loans to households and businesses and the borrowing frenzy continued. \\u201cThings never really normalized,\\u201d said Selva Demiralp, an economist at Koc University in Istanbul.\", \"When the chief of the central bank resisted pressure from the president to lower the 24 percent interest rate in 2019, Mr. Erdogan fired him, the beginning of a pattern.\", \"To prop up the lira, Turkish banks began selling off their reserves of dollars. Those stocks of dollars are now running low.\", \"The global economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic has added to the strains by limiting the sales of Turkish goods around the world. Tourism, which was one of Turkey\\u2019s most dynamic sectors, has also been badly hit.\", \"By keeping interest rates low, Mr. Erdogan argues that consumers will be more eager to keep shopping and businesses will be more inclined to borrow, invest money in the economy and hire workers.\", \"And if the lira loses value against the dollar, he says, Turkey\\u2019s exports will simply become cheaper and foreign consumers will want to buy even more.\", \"That is true to some degree \\u2014 but it comes at a heavy price. Turkey is quite dependent on imports like automobile parts and medicine, as well as fuel and fertilizer and other raw materials. When the lira depreciates, those products cost more to buy.\", \"At the same time, Mr. Erdogan\\u2019s disdain for conventional economic theory has scared off some foreign investors, who had been eager to loan Turkish businesses hundreds of millions of dollars but now are losing faith in the currency.\", \"And the lower rates go, the faster inflation rises. Over the past year, the lira has lost more than 45 percent of its value, and the official inflation rate has surged past 20 percent, although many analysts believe the rate on the streets is much higher.\", \"By comparison, an inflation rate of 6.8 percent so far this year in the United States (the highest in nearly four decades) and a 4.9 percent rate in the eurozone are enough to set off alarms.\", \"In Turkey, skyrocketing prices are causing misery among the poor and impoverishing the middle class.\", \"\\u201cWe can\\u2019t make a living,\\u201d said Mihriban Aslan, as she waited on a long line to buy bread in Istanbul\\u2019s Sultangazi district. \\u201cMy husband is 60 years old, he can\\u2019t work much now.\\u201d He has a small pension of 1,800 lira \\u2014 which at the moment is worth about $125. \\u201cI sometimes do needle work at home to bring in extra money,\\u201d she said.\", \"Businesses would rather hoard goods than sell them because they don\\u2019t think they will be able to afford to replace them.\", \"Ismail Arslanturk, a 22-year-old cashier at a neighborhood grocery shop, complained that the price of green lentils has nearly doubled. \\u2018\\u2019I don\\u2019t believe the economy will be fixed after this point,\\u201d said Mr. Arslanturk, who added he was forced to leave high school to help support his family. \\u201cI am hopeless.\\u2019\\u2019\", \"The president has doubled down on his approach, asserting he will \\u201cnever compromise\\u201d on his opposition to higher interest rates. \\u201cInterest rates make the rich richer, the poor poorer,\\u201d he said in an interview on national television last month. \\u201cWe have prevented our country from being crushed in such a way.\\u201d\", \"The president has invoked Islamic precepts against usury and referred to interest charges on loans as the \\u201cmother and father of all evil,\\u201d and blamed foreign interference for rising prices. Analysts like Mr. Barkey of the Council on Foreign Relations said that such comments are primarily aimed at appealing to more conservative religious segments of the country that represent the core of Mr. Erdogan\\u2019s support.\", \"Turkey\\u2019s fundamental problem, Mr. Barkey maintains, is that it has an overly confident ruler who has been in power for a long time. \\u201cHe believes in his omnipotence and he\\u2019s making mistakes,\\u201d Mr. Barkey said, \\u201cbut he\\u2019s so surrounded by yes men that nobody can challenge him.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6b1503ee5cf211ec9fff17141eb4d509"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6b1503ee5cf211ec9fff17141eb4d509"}},
