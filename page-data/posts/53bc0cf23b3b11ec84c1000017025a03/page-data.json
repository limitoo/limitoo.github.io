So there's a bit of a change.\\\"\", \"And it appeared cashed up buyers from the North Island might be at least in part responsible for some of the eye watering sums being paid for what were once affordable homes.\", \"Tait said some weeks up to 30 percent of the buyers he saw were from out of town.\", \"\\\"[There is] I think a certain impossibility of getting on the property market in Wellington, Auckland, Hamilton or Tauranga, so people are coming down here. I've got a guy in Tauranga who rang me today because he'd given up hope of buying in Tauranga and is now looking for a house down here.\\\"\", \"And the growth was not just a one off, with QV showing prices were up by 5.8 percent in the three months to August as well.\", \"The suburb of Linwood in the city's east had long been a place where first home buyers were able to get good value for money.\", \"RNZ hit the streets to see if that was still the case and ran in to John Billingsley.\", \"\\\"My boy just paid $415,000 for a house that had a value of $330,000 [in December].

So if you take into consideration income as well, Christchurch is still the most affordable city.\\\"\", \"Crucially new homes were still being built in Christchurch, with consents up 67 percent on last year, meaning supply would very soon catch up with demand and take some of the heat out of the market, he said.\", \"Tony Alexander was also of the view that prices were not about to get completely out of hand, mostly due to the impact of rising interest rates between now and the middle of next year.\"]","href_hash":"53bc0cf23b3b11ec84c1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"53bc0cf23b3b11ec84c1000017025a03"}},
