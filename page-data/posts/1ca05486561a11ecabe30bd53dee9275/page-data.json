And while much uncertainty remains about what impact the Omicron variant will have on the pandemic, many nations have scrambled to impose travel restrictions \\u2014 or in some cases introduced more serious measures.\", \"With cases of Omicron now growing worldwide, the prospects of even more stringent restrictions are looming over a holiday period that many had hoped would be a return to some normalcy. In Europe, already the epicenter of a surge in the pandemic in recent weeks, the uncertainties raised by Omicron have ignited fears that the winter ahead will be more difficult than anticipated.\", \"On Sunday, Britain\\u2019s health security agency confirmed 86 additional cases of the Omicron variant, bringing the total nationally to 246, while authorities in Denmark reported 183 cases of the variant. Both nations are widely seen as leaders in genomic sequencing and testing, giving them an edge in tracking the spread of the virus and its mutations.\", \"That the number of Omicron cases is rising quickly was clear. What it might mean was less so.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re going to see lots of big numbers over the course of the next several weeks in countries around the world,\\u201d said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \\u201cAnd this shouldn\\u2019t be a surprise. This virus is just acting like a highly transmissible respiratory virus.\\u201d\", \"Part of the increase may be explained by the new laser focus of public health officials on the variant, which early evidence suggests may spread more quickly than the Delta variant.\", \"\\u201cOnce you find someone who is infected,\\u201d Dr. Osterholm said, \\u201cand you start looking at their contacts or the environment they\\u2019re in, you\\u2019re just going to find a lot more.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said that the known numbers were so small that it was hard to know how much to make of the increase. A few hundred cases is still a \\u201ctiny fraction\\u201d of around 44,000 new coronavirus cases on average that Britain experiences daily, he said.\", \"\\u201cI think the question people want to know is whether Omicron is going to outcompete Delta, and it\\u2019s a possibility,\\u201d he said.\", \"At the moment, Dr. Hotez said, there is not enough data to conclude that. If at the end of next week Omicron represents \\u201ceven 10 percent of the Delta cases, then I\\u2019ll be more concerned,\\u201d he said.\", \"But even before the discovery of the new variant, some public health experts were raising the alarm that the travel restrictions in place in much of Europe were not enough to stem the surge in coronavirus cases already taking place.\", \"Some lamented what they said was the cost of nations letting their guard down, criticizing the failure to reimpose restrictions like indoor mask wearing and social distancing, and to remind people to isolate if they have been exposed to the virus.\", \"Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust and a former member of the British government\\u2019s scientific advisory body, wrote in The Observer that the rise of Omicron was a signal that the \\u201cstaggering progress\\u201d made since the start of the pandemic \\u201cis being squandered.\\u201d Richer nations, he argued, had a \\u201cblinkered\\u201d focus and were \\u201clulled into thinking that the worst of the pandemic was behind us.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis variant reminds us all that we remain closer to the start of the pandemic than the end,\\u201d he said.\", \"In parts of the United States, health officials have also seen a steady climb in the number of Omicron cases. The variant has been detected in at least 16 states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin.\", \"Some Americans, too, are becoming more nervous.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re paying closer attention, which we haven\\u2019t probably for a little while,\\u201d said Rory Bakke, who lives in Marin County, Calif. \\u201cIt\\u2019s upped our attentiveness to the reports of symptoms and how contagious it is and the science reports.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Bakke expressed frustration over the latest threat.\", \"\\u201cI feel like if everyone had just followed the guidelines, we wouldn\\u2019t be in this situation,\\u201d she said. \\u201cSo that\\u2019s disheartening.\\u201d\", \"The Omicron variant was first identified in southern Africa in late November. On Saturday, Zambia became the latest African country \\u2014 alongside South Africa, Botswana, Nigeria and Ghana \\u2014 to report cases.\", \"Since its emergence, a number of travel restrictions have been imposed to try to slow its spread, including in the United States and Europe.\", \"Still, some European governments have been hesitant to impose sweeping new domestic restrictions ahead of a highly anticipated period of travel and big gatherings, especially given the lockdown in much of Europe last winter. Many have instead opted to focus on restricting travel from abroad or requiring more testing for travelers.\", \"But some fear the travel restrictions are a case of too little too late.\", \"\\u201cI think that might be a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted,\\u201d Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh who advises the government, told the BBC. \", \"He said it was \\u201ctoo late to make a material difference to the course of the Omicron wave.\\u201d\", \"So far, the British government has told the public to proceed as usual with their holiday plans, though it has urged people to get booster shots. Dominic Raab, Britain\\u2019s deputy prime minister, called that the \\u201csurest defense\\u201d in a BBC interview on Sunday.\", \"\\u201cOur message is this: Enjoy Christmas this year,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe vaccine rollout means we\\u2019re in a position to do so.\\u201d\", \"In Denmark, health authorities announced on Sunday that 183 people had confirmed cases of the Omicron variant, a \\u201cworrying increase,\\u201d said Henrik Ullum, head of the Statens Serum Institut, Denmark\\u2019s public health agency.\", \"\\u201cThere are now ongoing infection chains,\\u201d he said in a statement, where the infection is seen among people who have not been traveling or had connections with travelers.\", \"European countries have taken steps to curb social contacts in recent days amid an overall surge in cases.\", \"Belgium is requiring people to work from home and ordered schools closed a week earlier for Christmas; Italy banned unvaccinated people from certain leisure activities; and Ireland has shuttered night clubs and restricted gatherings.\", \"Germany has banned the unvaccinated from much of public life. And in an indication of the severity of the situation, the German government, which had been hesitant to put in place government mandates around the pandemic because of the country\\u2019s history with authoritarianism, has plans to make vaccination compulsory next year.\", \"Some nations have already seen pushback to the restrictions. In Austria, tens of thousands marched in protest on Saturday for the second weekend in a row over the government\\u2019s decision to impose a tough new lockdown and its plans for a vaccine mandate.\", \"Experts had time and again have warned that not enough had been done to combat the Delta variant across Europe. This week, they reiterated those warnings and call for action.\", \"Michael Ryan, the head of the emergencies program at the World Health Organization, speaking last week at a news conference, said European countries should have taken more precautions this autumn to protect their populations.\", \"\\u201cWe will have to be a little patient in order to understand the implications of the Omicron variant,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbut, certainly we are dealing with a crisis now. And that crisis is in Europe, and it is being driven by the Delta variant.\\u201d\", \"Now, he said, it is time for \\u201ceveryone to recommit ourselves to controlling the pandemic of multiple strains or multiple variants of the same virus.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"1ca05486561a11ecabe30bd53dee9275"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1ca05486561a11ecabe30bd53dee9275"}},
