Allowing texting access also opens the hotline to those who are deaf, have hearing problems, or have a speech disability.\", \"Currently, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline uses 800-273-TALK (8255), which sends calls to about 180 call centers around the country.\", \"\\\"For millions of us, especially young people and those with disabilities\\u2014they are more likely to text than they are to call when they are in crisis,\\\" said FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel during the agency's meeting Thursday. \\\"The bottom line is it should not matter when you make a voice call or send a text message, because we should connect people in crisis to the resources they need, no matter how they communicate.\\\"\", \"After the vote, phone companies have until July 2022 to set up both the calling and texting systems for the 988 number. The FCC also said Thursday that currently, AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon already support 988 as a number people can call to reach the hotline.\", \"Suicide rates have risen nationwide over the past 20 years, with a slight drop last year when around 45,000 people died by suicide in the U.S.\", \"Experts say a three-digit hotline that is easier to remember and more publicized could help those in crisis by making mental health resources easier for people to reach.\", \"According to the World Health Organization, suicide is the second leading cause of death among the ages of 15-29.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935783/fcc-jessica-rosenworcel-suicide-prevention-hotline.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The FCC voted 4-0 Thursday to allow the new 988 suicide prevention hotline to receive texts as well as calls.
