Wade.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-02T11:47:31.000Z","content":"[\"All six Republican appointees on the Supreme Court have long signaled that they have qualms with the Roe v. Wade decision. What\\u2019s been less clear is whether at least five of them \\u2014 enough to make a majority \\u2014 would be willing to overturn Roe, which would require scrapping decades of legal precedents.\", \"Doing so has downsides for the court. It would then look more like just another partisan branch of government that changes policy when its members change, rather than a nonpartisan interpreter of legal principles. At least a few justices are already worried about the court\\u2019s image. \\u201cThis court is not comprised of a bunch of partisan hacks,\\u201d Justice Amy Coney Barrett said in a recent speech.\", \"During yesterday\\u2019s arguments over a Mississippi abortion law, the three Democratic appointees on the court tried to appeal to their conservative colleagues\\u2019 concerns about the court\\u2019s standing. If the justices overturn Roe v. Wade, Justice Stephen Breyer said, many Americans would say, \\u201c\\u2018You\\u2019re just politicians.\\u2019\\u201d Breyer added, \\u201cThat\\u2019s what kills us as an American institution.\\u201d\", \"This strategy has worked in the past. It has sometimes swayed Chief Justice John Roberts during his 16 years on the court and also seemed to influence Barrett and Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year. On L.G.B.T.Q. rights and Obamacare, the justices issued rulings that were more modest and consistent with precedent than a strictly partisan court would have issued.\", \"On abortion, however, many court watchers think that the strategy is likely to fail this time.\", \"The questions that the justices ask during arguments are often a preview of how they will rule, Adam Liptak, who covers the court for The Times, points out. Yesterday, all six conservative justices asked questions suggesting support for Mississippi\\u2019s law. It outlaws abortion after 15 weeks, a clear violation of Roe and subsequent court rulings protecting abortion access early in pregnancy.\", \"Roberts\\u2019s questions indicated that he might still prefer a relatively narrow ruling that does not fully undo Roe. But he is no longer the swing vote. After Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\u2019s death, the court has a majority of five Republican-appointed justices even if Roberts votes with the Democratic appointees.\", \"In yesterday\\u2019s arguments, all five of those justices \\u2014 Barrett, Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas \\u2014 seemed interested in a full repeal of Roe. Alito suggested that the ruling was \\u201cegregiously wrong.\\u201d\", \"Still, the outcome remains uncertain. Justices often try to influence one another during behind-the-scenes negotiations over a case. Roberts or the three liberal justices may yet convince Barrett and Kavanaugh that the political costs of full repeal are too large. The court is likely to announce its decision by early July.\", \"Either way, the long political battle over abortion seems to be on the verge of a new era. In much of the country, abortions may soon be less common than they have been for nearly a half-century.\", \"\\u201cWill this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?\\u201d Sonia Sotomayor asked. \\u201cI don\\u2019t see how it is possible.\\u201d\", \"Elena Kagan made the case for upholding Roe: \\u201cThis is part of our law. \\u2026 This is part of the fabric of women\\u2019s existence in this country.\\u201d\", \"Breyer quoted from a 1992 Supreme Court decision that reaffirmed Roe: \\u201cTo overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to re-examine a watershed decision would subvert the court\\u2019s legitimacy beyond any serious question.\\u201d\", \"Roberts, in suggesting the justices uphold the Mississippi law without fully overturning Roe, noted that the U.S. now permits more abortion access than many other countries. \\u201cI\\u2019d like to focus on the 15-week ban,\\u201d he said, adding that it was similar to \\u201cthe standard that the vast majority of other countries have.\\u201d\", \"Kavanaugh suggested that overturning Roe was the neutral solution: \\u201cWhy should this court be the arbiter rather than Congress, the state legislatures, state supreme courts, the people being able to resolve this?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIf I were to ask you what constitutional right protects the right to abortion, is it privacy?\\u201d Thomas asked. \\u201cIs it autonomy? What would it be?\\u201d\", \"Alito expressed doubt that the Constitution protected abortion: \\u201cCan it said that the right to abortion is deeply rooted in the history and traditions of the American people?\\u201d\", \"Barrett noted that previous rulings requiring abortion access \\u201cemphasize the burdens of parenting.\\u201d But because women can put babies up for adoption, those burdens are not an issue, she suggested.\", \"Gorsuch implied that the court\\u2019s previous focus on viability \\u2014 the point after which a fetus can survive outside the womb \\u2014 was inappropriate. (Many abortion opponents emphasize that younger fetuses are living beings.) \\u201cIf this court will reject the viability line, do you see any other intelligible principle that the court could choose?\\u201d Gorsuch asked.\", \"\\u201cWhat I heard Wednesday morning was not a court in which a majority was worried about backlash, but a court ready for revolutionary change,\\u201d Mary Ziegler, a legal historian, writes.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m skeptical about dark prophecies of a legitimacy crisis for the Supreme Court should it overturn Roe \\u2014 or the coming electoral blood bath for the G.O.P.,\\u201d The Washington Post\\u2019s Megan McArdle writes. \\u201cMost people don\\u2019t care about abortion as much as pro-choice Twitter. Many of those who do are on the other side.\\u201d (A previous edition of this newsletter analyzed public opinion.)\", \"Too often, a viral video is the most effective way for Americans of color to find justice, Esau McCaulley writes.\", \"Prehistoric: This dinosaur had a battle ax for a tail.\", \"Headway: What does it mean to save a neighborhood?\", \"Wheels: Step inside an auto show for the raddest cars of the \\u201980s and \\u201990s.\", \"Advice from Wirecutter: Ways to support small businesses this holiday season.\", \"Lives Lived: Alvin Lucier was an experimental composer who was more interested in the physics of sound than in melody and harmony.

Lil Nas X was an extremely vocal member of Nicki Minaj\\u2019s online fan army, while Rodrigo, a well-documented Swiftie, interpolated a riff from Taylor Swift on her debut album.\", \"In some cases, established stars shepherded the careers of these younger artists.
