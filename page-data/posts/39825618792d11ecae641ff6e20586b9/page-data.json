About once a month, she\\u2019ll wander into our room after bedtime full of unanswerable questions about her own place in the universe. \\u201cWhy are we even here?\\u201d she\\u2019ll ask us. And this tends to happen after 10 p.m. on a weeknight, when her dad and I are least capable of giving her a vaguely satisfying answer. It\\u2019s a genuine reflection of the way her mind works, even if it\\u2019s also a bedtime stalling tactic.\", \"Last week, her late-evening dread took a new and Covid-related turn. As she sat on the foot of our bed, her questioning projected into the future in a way it hadn\\u2019t before. \\u201cWhat if Covid never ends?\\u201d she asked. \\u201cWhat if it\\u2019s still around when I\\u2019m in college?\\u201d\", \"My internal response in that moment does not meet the Times standard for expletive use, though I can tell you that the first word was \\u201choly.\\u201d I try not to over-worry about how the pandemic is affecting my kids\\u2019 tiny psyches, because that\\u2019s not completely within my control; I can only provide the safest possible environment for them and pray for the best. If they\\u2019re struggling, I support them, but I can\\u2019t erase the struggle.\", \"But this line of questioning stuck with me for days after. Especially because as we were talking that night, my daughter said: \\u201cWhen the pandemic started, I was only 7, and I wasn\\u2019t scared. Now I\\u2019m 9 and I really understand.\\u201d It's a gut punch to think about how Covid has shaped an entire generation's experience of childhood, and this one hurt more than most.\", \"On the other hand, I was impressed, as I often am, with my daughter\\u2019s self-awareness. She understands that her cognitive capacities have grown in the past two years. And it also made me wonder if there was some developmental leap she was experiencing that was not unique to her.\", \"I called Sally Beville Hunter, a clinical associate professor of child and family studies at the University of Tennessee, to see if this kind of philosophical musing was typical for a young tween. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a huge cognitive transition happening\\u201d around this age, Hunter told me.\", \"It\\u2019s the stage when children develop the capacity for abstract thought, she said. The pioneering developmental psychologist Jean Piaget called this transition the \\u201cformal operational stage,\\u201d and in his research he found it began around age 11, but Hunter said subsequent research has found that it may begin earlier. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the first time children can consider multiple possibilities and test them against each other,\\u201d she said. Which helps explain why my daughter has begun thinking about whether Covid will linger into her college years, a decade from now.\", \"Another aspect of development that may be happening for her is a stage that the psychologist Erik Erikson called \\u201cidentity versus role diffusion\\u201d (also referred to as \\u201crole confusion\\u201d), which is shorthand for children figuring out their position in the world. \\u201cThis is the first time when kids have questions about their own existence, questions about self-identity, the meaning of life and the changing role of authority,\\u201d Hunter said.\", \"That is to say, my daughter is beginning her yearslong shift from childhood to adulthood, and her existential questioning isn\\u2019t unique to children living through a pandemic. As I talked to Hunter, I had a vivid flashback of being around my daughter\\u2019s age and not being able to sleep because I was worried about nuclear winter. I remember going into my brother\\u2019s room after bedtime to ask him if we were going to die because the Soviets might drop the bomb \\u2014 and he assured me that it was very unlikely.\", \"The more I think about it, I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s necessarily a bad thing that my child\\u2019s intellectual journey is affected by what is going on around her. I appreciate having a child who thinks through the impact of a yearslong pandemic instead of being blissfully unaware of reality, even if it is somewhat painful to watch her dawning realization that life has infinite possibilities, not all of them good.\", \"That evening, I told her that she probably wouldn\\u2019t have to contend with Covid in college, but I can\\u2019t predict the future, so I can\\u2019t promise (and I wasn\\u2019t quite ready to break down the difference between \\u201cpandemic\\u201d and \\u201cendemic\\u201d). I tried to remind her of all the good things that had happened over the past two years, even if we would have preferred that the pandemic had never happened. Her dad told her that the way we make meaning of our lives is through the relationships we have with family and friends, and the good deeds that we do.\", \"I\\u2019m not sure she found any of our answers satisfactory, but that\\u2019s work she ultimately has to do on her own. And Hunter gave me a suggestion to help us cut down on the nighttime colloquies: Give her a notebook to keep by her bedside, so that she can write down her questions and then ask them in the morning. I still won\\u2019t be able to solve her existential crises, but I\\u2019ll have a better shot after coffee.\", \"If you want a chance to get your Tiny Victory published, find us on Instagram @NYTparenting and use the hashtag #tinyvictories; email us; or enter your Tiny Victory at the bottom of this page.
