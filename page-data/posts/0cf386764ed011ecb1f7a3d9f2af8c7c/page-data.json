She climbs up to reach it but tumbles to the ground and lands on her feet. The brief animation serves to introduce \\u201cApproval Junkie,\\u201d a one-woman Audible production that opened Tuesday at the Minetta Lane Theater, neatly encapsulating the whole of its familiar, and repeated, moral fable about chasing the highs of success.\", \"By some measures, the subject in this case is exceptional. \\u201cApproval Junkie\\u201d is written and performed by the radio and television journalist Faith Salie, in collaboration with the director Amanda Watkins. Fans may recognize Salie\\u2019s bright, even demeanor from her roles as a regular panelist on the NPR news quiz show \\u201cWait Wait \\u2026 Don\\u2019t Tell Me!\\u201d and as a contributor to \\u201cCBS News Sunday Morning,\\u201d positions that reward gentle, authoritative relatability.\", \"But the anecdotes from her life that Salie recalls here, of striving for achievement and affirmation, reflect gendered expectations and social pressures that many women will recognize.\", \"After four years of competing in her high school pageant, Salie finally won by performing a Barbra Streisand song in a rainbow-sequin mini. She still has the tiara. (\\u201cIt\\u2019s missing some stones \\u2026 aren\\u2019t we all?\\u201d) Pursuit of the spotlight drew her to Los Angeles, where an acting coach once asked, \\u201cWhy aren\\u2019t you as pretty as I want you to be?\\u201d adding that motherhood would soften her features.\", \"Salie\\u2019s quest for thinness led to early struggles with anorexia and a lasting fixation on appearance. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know who could tell me enough that I\\u2019m beautiful,\\u201d she says.\", \"Perhaps it\\u2019s no surprise then that Salie is not exactly an unselfconscious performer. With the exception of one truly unrestrained outburst (at an Ayurvedic healing center, no less), onstage she is poised and polished, watchfully reserved. This is not an unruly takedown of conventional womanhood\\u2019s narrow strictures from someone on the outside. In a navy silk jumpsuit and beige heels (the costume design is by Ivan Ingermann), Salie could stroll into an advertisement for no-makeup makeup, pointing to the beauty ideals she embodies as a trap.\", \"The production has an amiable, anodyne quality well tailored to its release as an Audible Original recording (\\u201cApproval Junkie\\u201d is based on Salie\\u2019s 2016 book of essays of the same name). Watkins\\u2019 minimal staging marks Salie\\u2019s incidental transitions with as little as the spin of a bar stool or a few steps to one side. A backdrop of fractured panels glows in shades of pastel (the set design is by Jack Magaw, and lighting by Amanda Zieve), and a buoyant piano composition by the sound designer Brandon Bush comforts listeners like a plush love seat.\", \"\\u201cApproval Junkie\\u201d wants to suggest a certain self-awareness about the fallacy of craving outside validation. But for all its pat wisdom \\u2014 \\u201cDon\\u2019t change yourself for someone else,\\u201d Salie tells her kids, \\u201cchange yourself for you\\u201d \\u2014 the play still demonstrates the value of caring what other people think.\", \"\\u201cSeeking approval has not undone me,\\u201d Salie says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s built me.\\u201d Even so, being put together is not nearly as interesting onstage as falling apart.\"]","href_hash":"0cf386764ed011ecb1f7a3d9f2af8c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0cf386764ed011ecb1f7a3d9f2af8c7c"}},
