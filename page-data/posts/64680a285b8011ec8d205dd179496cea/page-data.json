Admission Rank), university admission hung on that all-important number.\", \"The days of waiting on these much-anticipated scores could well be on their way out with a massive rise in the number of early round offers being made to students nationally.\", \"Figures compiled by the ABC show some universities have more than doubled their number of early offers, with many delivered before final exams have even begun.\", \"While the institutions have long had early rounds of offers, the programs were given a kick along by COVID-19 as universities tried to adjust for the disadvantages of remote learning.\", \"Now early offers\\u00a0look\\u00a0set to stay, with a growing number of universities finding that not only do they alleviate final exam stress, they also recruit\\u00a0better students.\", \"At the Australian Catholic University, offers have nearly tripled, up from 3,000 last year to nearly 9,000 this year.\", \"At the University of Canberra,\\u00a0they've doubled between 2019 and 2021, with up to 2,000 offers already made for study next year.\", \"Charles Darwin University has had similar success, jumping from 548 to 963 offers between last year and this year,.\", \"At Griffith University, offers are up more than 6 per cent this year.\", \"South Australia's Flinders University has made 2,026 offers for next year, up from just 181 back in 2019.\", \"In Victoria, La Trobe University has also had strong growth in offers, going from 2,287 pre-pandemic to 3,032.\", \"But it's the University of Western Sydney that's been the stand-out performer, with early offers rising from 7,000 in 2019 to 15,000 in 2020.\", \"It's made 9,000 offers so far for 2022, but expects numbers to rise as its program remains open until January.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Early

universities encouraging their new recruits to officially enrol before main-round offers have been rolled out so they can lock in the best student talent.\", \"Australian Catholic University Provost

students from regions.\\\"\", \"Early admission selection criteria can include individual subject and exam marks, Year 11 results, or the portfolio work of creative arts students.\", \"\\\"If a student wants to do an arts degree, then we will look at their performance and things like history and English and languages and other related subjects,\\\" Mr Kourtis said.\", \"The program at La Trobe University also recognises a student's contribution to their community.\", \"Flinders University has also continued a practice it began in response to the pandemic in 2020, and makes early offers based on Year 11 results.\", \"\\\"Schools have told us that the early admission scheme allows students to focus on specific subjects for their particular university degree rather than simply

admitted through early admission, and found early entrants went on to achieve a higher grade point average than their peers in more than 50 per cent of courses.\", \"\\\"We found their performance is as good, and in some instances better, than students who were admitted solely on the basis of the year 12 result,\\\" Mr Kourtis said.\", \"\\\"What these programs do is actually challenge the primacy
