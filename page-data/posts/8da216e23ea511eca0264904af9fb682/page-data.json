cave's entrance, before braving an eight-hour trek through the underground with no boardwalks, lighting or infrastructure.\", \"\\\"Because they were mostly on their honeymoon, they would dress up in their finest attire for the journey,\\\" Mr Kearns said.\", \"He said the \\\"romantically adventurous\\\" would sometimes break away from the main group to a dark corner of the cave for their
