Since then, the confirmation process has been unusually slow.\", \"That is partly because Republicans have held up scores of the president\\u2019s nominations. But it is also because of turmoil in the Garcetti administration and more generally at City Hall.\", \"On Tuesday, the mayor finally testified before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. To cut to the chase, Garcetti denied knowing that a Los Angeles police officer on his security detail had complained of sexual harassment by a top aide.\", \"Responding to Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, the mayor said he \\u201cnever witnessed\\u201d the alleged harassment, \\u201cnor was it brought to my attention.\\u201d If it had been, he added, he would have acted to stop it, saying that opposition to workplace abuses was \\u201ca core issue\\u201d for him.\", \"The mild exchange capped months of speculation over whether Los Angeles\\u2019s current wave of City Hall scandal would cost Garcetti a long-sought place in the Biden administration. Garcetti, who joined Biden\\u2019s inner circle after ending his own presidential bid in 2020, had at one point appeared to be in contention for a cabinet post.\", \"As the pandemic spiked in Southern California, Garcetti took himself out of the running for a gig with the White House. He accepted the ambassadorial nomination in July as infections waned and the city began to look ahead to next year\\u2019s mayoral election, which he can\\u2019t run in after serving two terms. Since then, however, anxiety around homelessness and crime has risen, and City Hall has become the hub of a wider-than-usual array of corruption charges.\", \"One City Council member is in federal prison and two more are under indictment. A former deputy mayor is embroiled in a bribery case and facing federal charges. Garcetti\\u2019s chief of staff spent several months on leave after posting disparaging remarks on a private Facebook page about California political figures, including the 91-year-old labor icon Dolores Huerta. The former head of the city water and power department has agreed to plead guilty to bribery charges in a case involving the city attorney.\", \"And then there\\u2019s the former member of Garcetti\\u2019s security detail, who has sued the city, accusing the former deputy chief of staff, Rick Jacobs, of sexual harassment. Garcetti himself has not been charged in any of the cases, but the officer, Matthew Garza, has claimed that the mayor knew that Jacobs, a well-known Los Angeles fund-raiser, was groping and harassing him and failed to stop it. The mayor has repeatedly denied the charge.\", \"In July, a lawyer for several former City Hall employees wrote to the Senate committee, calling the alleged harassment \\u201ccommon knowledge.\\u201d By mid-fall, the mayor\\u2019s nomination still hadn\\u2019t gotten a hearing, even though the committee had already advanced other potentially problematic picks \\u2014 Rahm Emanuel, for example, who was mayor of Chicago during a controversial police shooting and is up for ambassador to Japan.\", \"In November, a committee spokesman confirmed that the senators were reviewing the sexual harassment allegations \\u201cin detail.\\u201d On Tuesday, as the Senate panel convened, the former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson tweeted that \\u201cwe can\\u2019t keep covering up abusive behavior and allow enablers to get away with knowing about it.\\u201d\", \"But the committee, which will vote at a later date, seemed satisfied. Shaheen\\u2019s was the only question about the scandal before the hearing was cut short to accommodate other votes in progress.\", \"Garcetti appeared with the ambassadorial nominees for Pakistan and Germany \\u2014 Donald Armin Blome, a career diplomat, and Amy Gutmann, the president of the University of Pennsylvania \\u2014 and promised to prioritize trade, green energy and human rights in dealing with India, a critical strategic ally.\", \"Shawn Hubler is a reporter for The New York Times who is based in Sacramento.\", \"For more:\", \"Pfizer makes a major announcement about its Covid pill.\", \"Our 50 best recipes of 2021.\", \"Today\\u2019s tip comes from the reader Evelyn Howard:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.
