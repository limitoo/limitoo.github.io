Do Your Research</div>\", \"Before setting off on a Black Friday buying frenzy, it's important to do some homework on the different prices being offered by various brands.\", \"The NRF's Cullen said consumers should monitor retailers' websites as well as mobile apps for the latest information, as \\\"many retailers have introduced tools that specify if a particular item is running low and whether it is in stock locally or online.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">2. Is It Actually a Bargain?</div>\", \"While a certain price slash at first glance may appear to be a steal, the discount may not actually be that different (if it varies at all) from what the company normally offers.\", \"Chatzky, who is also a best-selling author of several finance books, said: \\\"Some sales aren't really sales. There are stores that routinely offer 25 per cent off everything when they run 'Friends & Family' days, for example. When they do the same for the holidays, it's not such a big deal.\", \"\\\"In fact, I'd argue that when you know a particular retailer has a regular 25 per cent off cadence, you can just wait to buy,\\\" she added.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">3. Review Price History</div>\", \"Knowing what the pre-Black Friday price of a product is hugely helpful when it comes to establishing whether the discount is significant or not.\", \"There are plugin tools available that can help you do this, such as the Camelizer Chrome extension of the CamelCamelCamel website, which Chatzky says can be used to help set up price alerts.\", \"The Camelizer tool can show users a graph charting the price of a product on Amazon over a period of time.\", \"Keepa is another Chrome extension that can track the price history of an item on Amazon.\", \"For both extensions, users can set up price watches to be notified of price drops on certain products on their wish lists.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1940363/people-looking-black-friday-website.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A couple looking at a Black Friday sale at a website seen on a laptop computer. Do your research on which companies are offering what prices before beginning your Black Friday shopping spree.</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">4. ...and Product Quality</div>\", \"Consumers should be aware that you may be sacrificing quality in exchange for the discount on some items offered during a Black Friday sale. For example, some sellers may be offering a reduced price for an older model of a product or potentially even a pre-used device.\", \"Chatzky explains: \\\"Some companies produce goods specifically for Black Friday sales and\\u2014like goods produced for outlet malls\\u2014they may not be of the same quality or have the same features as goods regularly produced. This is particularly true of electronics that are sold as Black Friday Doorbusters.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">5. Bag a Price Match</div>\", \"Doing your pre-Black Friday research on which brands are offering what prices puts you in the best place to angle for a price match.\", \"Most retailers offer some version of a \\\"price match guarantee\\\" policy. Customers can usually request a price match at the time of purchase or within a certain time period following the purchase, depending on the company's policy.\", \"Consumers should bear in mind that price match policies usually come with several terms and conditions (including exclusions for certain sale events, which may or may not include Black Friday). So be sure to read the fine print before making your case with any given company.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">6. Scope Out Other Perks</div>\", \"Those looking for more ways to save should keep an eye out for additional perks like a gift card or extra discount for curbside pickup orders, the NRF's Cullen noted.\", \"Chatzky added: \\\"Browser plugins like Honey will help you search the web for coupons you can apply so you don't have to do it yourself.\\\"\", \"If a gift item you've got your eye on is out of stock, you should certainly check back for it at a later date. But if you're struggling to bag it at a later date, customers should consider a gift card.\", \"\\\"Consumers will spend an estimated $28 billion on gift cards this holiday season and they can be a great last-minute gift or a solution when an item is out of stock,\\\" Cullen said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">7. Add Items To Your Basket the Day Before</div>\", \"If you're shopping online, saving items in your checkout basket before Black Friday may help you avoid accidentally purchasing unwanted items on the day, while absentmindedly browsing between a swarm of websites.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">8. Make a Wish List or Set a Budget</div>\", \"It's easy to get lost in a sea of discounts on Black Friday and create a bigger dent in your wallet than you'd hoped.\", \"Making a wish list or a budget before you start shopping is a good way to help put a cap on your purchases and avoid overspending.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">9. Check the Warranty and Return Policies</div>\", \"Before you buy any products, be sure to check the warranty for your item as well as any \\\"money back guarantee\\\" or other return policies.\", \"Some items over Black Friday may be non-refundable or come with other special terms and conditions. Be sure to check the company's policies before making your final purchase.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1940358/person-shopping-their-phone.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A person shopping at a fashion website on their phone.
