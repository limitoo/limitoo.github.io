Around 2016, she got into the habit of taking the 45-minute train ride into the city so she could go to Queens and stand at the water\\u2019s edge, staring at the skyline across the East River.\", \"\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t just a magical city view,\\u201d Ms. Sahebzada said. \\u201cIt was a view of hope. I always prayed, standing there, and I said, \\u2018God, I don\\u2019t know when, but allow me to live here one day.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Queens, after all, was where her family first landed in the United States when Ms. Sahebzada was 8. Her mother fled Afghanistan near the end of the Afghan-Soviet War, traveling ahead of her husband, and gave birth to Ms. Sahebzada in Nantes, France, where the family settled briefly. Undocumented and feeling unwelcome, they moved on to Hamburg, Germany, for a few years, before settling in Queens and eventually becoming U.S. citizens.\", \"Sometimes on her sojourns back to the borough, Ms. Sahebzada would stop into the leasing office where the developer TF Cornerstone was welcoming applicants to fill 2,614 apartments along Center Boulevard. She knew she couldn\\u2019t afford to move into one \\u2014 not yet \\u2014 but each time she saw a new apartment it motivated her.\", \"Ms. Sahebzada, now 31, splits her time between working as a special events manager for Tory Burch, the designer known for preppy and bohemian fashion, and as a social media influencer, known primarily for her makeup tutorials. She posted her first video in 2009. \\u201cAt that time,\\u201d she said, \\u201cit wasn\\u2019t at all about monetizing it. It was a hobby that I really enjoyed.\\u201d\", \"It took her a few years to get comfortable in front of the camera. \\u201cWhen you put yourself out there,\\u201d she said, \\u201cdifferent opinions come in, and you have to build a thick skin. But that\\u2019s the beauty of being a content creator: You get to have an authentic, organic relationship with your audience.\\u201d\", \"Eventually, she wanted to connect with a bigger audience, and was frustrated by how difficult that was. \\u201cIt was never about asking, \\u2018What\\u2019s wrong with me?\\u2019 but instead asking, \\u2018How do I change the industry?\\u2019 That goes for the world of influencers and beauty and fashion \\u2014 everything,\\u201d she said.\", \"Ms. Sahebzada, who speaks five languages (English, Farsi, German, Hindi and Urdu), took note that there were far more tutorials in English than in Farsi, the language she grew up speaking: \\u201cSo I said, \\u2018You know what? I\\u2019m going to take advantage of who I am \\u2014 let me do it in my native language.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"From there, her audience grew. Now nearly all of her videos are in Farsi, and 80 percent of her followers are in Afghanistan, most of them in Kabul. \\u201cGirls back in Afghanistan say to me, \\u2018You give me hope.\\u2019 Doors open for them, and that\\u2019s my main purpose,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt isn\\u2019t even about the makeup or the technique \\u2014 it was more about having the courage to go on camera and identify as an Afghan woman.\\u201d\", \"As she found success with her YouTube channel, Ms. Sahebzada became more serious about renting an apartment in Long Island City. She wanted to make it happen before she reached 50,000 followers on Instagram. In January, after she had 43, 000 followers, she signed her lease, and a few months later she posted a video celebrating 50,000 followers. (She now has 54,000 and counting.)\", \"Her studio apartment is well lit but small; she had to be creative to squeeze in a Covid-era home office, living space and a good spot to film her videos. \\u201cI\\u2019m the editor, I\\u2019m the videographer, I\\u2019m the talent, I\\u2019m the IT department,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a one-woman show, for sure.\\u201d\", \"The space where she makes her videos is adorned with personal effects and fashion statements, including a cross-body handbag with a brass-chain strap, Tory Burch pumps with metallic heels and a sketch of a young girl with her face turned backward \\u2014 an image Ms. Sahebzada identifies with. \\u201cI wanted to give a feeling of being in my home.\\u201d\", \"Sometimes she makes use of the building\\u2019s shared spaces \\u2014 a roof deck, a lounge \\u2014 to film her videos. She feels at home in the larger, diverse community that makes up the cluster of five high-rises. \\u201cI see people with my skin color, same religion and similar cultures. I don\\u2019t feel uncomfortable walking into the building,\\u201d she said.\", \"Occupation: Ms. Sahebzada is a social media influencer and special events manager for Tory Burch.\", \"Career path: After majoring in theater arts at Five Towns College, Ms. Sahebzada struggled to find her way. \\u201cAs an Afghan-American woman,\\u201d she said, \\u201cit was very hard to break into that industry. So I had to create a space for myself and find my own audience.\\u201d\", \"Benefits of a good boss: Ms. Sahebzada is grateful for the support her employer has shown Afghan women. \\u201cI\\u2019m incredibly honored to be working for Tory Burch,\\u201d she said.\", \"Her favorite aspect of the makeup tutorials is what she sees as their empowering essence. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not just about having a pretty face,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about being confident. Because when you feel good, you do good.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Sahebzada\\u2019s profile grew enough to catch the attention of producers at Tolo TV, one of the largest television broadcasters in Afghanistan. And in the spring of 2020, her tutorials became a regular Sunday morning segment. \\u201cI was trying to show the girls they can be themselves in whatever creative way they want,\\u201d she said.\", \"Her role as an influencer has been her way of connecting to what she described as \\u201cthe homeland I\\u2019ve never seen.\\u201d But that connection was severed last summer, as the U.S. military left Afghanistan and the Taliban regained control of the country.\", \"Around the time of the withdrawal, Ms. Sahebzada received a late-night call from her producer at Tolo TV, telling her that the Taliban had informed the network that women were not to appear on the air until further notice \\u2014 and Ms. Sahebzada had been singled out.\", \"\\u201cThe producer told me they specifically mentioned my name: \\u2018Zahra is forbidden to be on this program,\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019m across the world. The fact that the Taliban knew my name, that was a scary thing.\\u201d\", \"In September, after a few months away from social media, she started posting videos again. She is grateful that she still has access to these platforms, but she knows that much of her audience has been cut off from YouTube and Instagram.\", \"\\u201cThe fact that there is someone trying to shut the door on Afghan women \\u2014 I am blessed to be in a safe space,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAll I can think about are the girls who are there, who are not in a safe space.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"18d2c9564b7f11ecaa1c65446754d144"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"18d2c9564b7f11ecaa1c65446754d144"}},
