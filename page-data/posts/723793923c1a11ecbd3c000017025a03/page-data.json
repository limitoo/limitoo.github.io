Something new starts happening online. People seem really excited about it. Suddenly you\\u2019re curious. (Sure, I\\u2019ll join TikTok.) Or maybe you feel dread. (Am I too late to buy crypto?) Everyone at some point fears missing out on something.\", \"Speaking of which, have you heard about the metaverse? Even if you didn\\u2019t tune into Mark Zuckerberg\\u2019s 81-minute video disquisition last week on the future of human interaction, which culminated with the rebranding of Facebook as Meta, the term has been bubbling up this year. Leaders in technology, entertainment and fashion have rushed to stake their claim in it, though few seem to agree about what exactly it is. The important thing is that it\\u2019s coming.\", \"Conversations about the metaverse reduce the feeling of FOMO to its barest, most generalized form. \\u201cMetaverse\\u201d \\u2014 the term \\u2014 was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel, \\u201cSnow Crash,\\u201d and has recently been hurled into such wide and varied use that it has come to mean something no more specific than the future. Who wants to miss out on that?\", \"Well, to be fair, lots of people. And they have their reasons. For now, talk of the metaverse is mainly a branding exercise: an attempt to unify, under one conceptual banner, a bunch of things that are already taking shape online.\", \"Matthew Ball, a venture capitalist who writes about the metaverse, has described it as \\u201ca sort of successor state to the mobile internet,\\u201d which is helpfully demystifying: The metaverse describes the way in which several emerging technologies \\u2014 cryptocurrencies, NFTs, online game platforms like Roblox, and mixed and virtual reality hardware, including Facebook\\u2019s Oculus, for example \\u2014 may grow and overlap. In Mr. Zuckerberg\\u2019s words: \\u201cI believe the metaverse is the next chapter for the internet, and it\\u2019s the next chapter for our company too.\\u201d\", \"As a point of comparison, Mr. Ball often looks to the smartphone era, which changed our relationship with technology in ways that were as profound and shocking as they now seem banal.\", \"Think back 10 years to when smartphones and apps were new, and social media was on the rise. Lots of people believed that the supercomputer-in-your-pocket era would change, well, a lot of things, even if they didn\\u2019t quite know how. Metaverse boosters, who can seem eager to just jettison the last era\\u2019s baggage, believe we\\u2019re on the cusp of even bigger changes.\", \"If this sounds more linear than visionary, despite the sci-fi branding and \\u201cdecades from now\\u201d talk, that\\u2019s because it is. Fortnite has more than 300 million players around the world, many of whom see it as a way to hang out with friends and engage with the broader culture. Cryptocurrencies and NFTs are only speculative in the financial sense \\u2014\\u00a0they exist, and you probably know someone who owns some. There are tens of millions of virtual reality headsets in circulation now, mostly for gaming. Give one a shot. They\\u2019re interesting!\", \"You can even just consider the utterly obvious ways that the internet has become more present in your life, gesturing in the general metaversal direction. The way you\\u2019ve cultivated online personas in different contexts, on Instagram or LinkedIn or Slack. The way you play Scrabble on your phone all day, wherever you are. The dreary virtual office of the Covid Zoom grind. The group chat!\", \"Using a label like \\u201cthe metaverse\\u201d has the strange effect of making things that are already happening sound far-off and impossible. People really are spending enormous amounts of time and money in rich, gamelike interactive spaces with cultures and economies of their own. Entrepreneurs really are building an alternative financial system using blockchain technology, buying and selling virtual real estate, and trying to figure out how a placeless, stateless system might govern itself.\", \"As several tech writers have noted, Mr. Zuckerberg\\u2019s pitch is not particularly novel. (Any Roblox fan in your life could have told you that.) The label also provides a slippery subject for criticism. If anything about these trends is concerning to you, don\\u2019t worry! It\\u2019ll all be better when we\\u2019re really in the metaverse.\", \"For all its gestures at a vague future yet to be built, Mr. Zuckerberg\\u2019s attempt to explain and stake a claim over the metaverse made one thing clear: The strongest FOMO might be his. To someone whose company can be genuinely said to have changed the course of history, becoming central in the lives of billions of people, the prospect of yet another new internet era could be downright terrifying.\", \"It\\u2019s not lost on the early winners of the social media era that a lot of what people are getting excited about online right now \\u2014 pretty much anything that promises a \\u201cdecentralized\\u201d experience \\u2014 is, by definition, positioned against big firms like Facebook. (This would also explain why Mr. Zuckerberg spent so much time talking about virtual reality, where Facebook has a real foothold.)\", \"Not missing out on the last next big thing is what made tech leaders, and their companies, what they are. Missing out on the next big thing, whatever it is, is not an option. Giving various promising and threatening trends a unifying name is more comforting, from this view, than contemplating the chaos of dozens of competing technologies being adopted by billions of people careening off in directions that even the most prescient visionaries will get only a little bit right.\", \"As Benedict Evans, another venture capitalist, wrote in October, the current metaverse discourse is \\u201crather like standing in front of a whiteboard in the early 1990s and writing words like interactive TV, hypertext, broadband, AOL, multimedia, and maybe video and games, and then drawing a box around them all and labeling the box \\u2018information superhighway.\\u2019\\u201d (His former employer, the crypto-forward firm Andreessen Horowitz \\u2014 where a named partner is on Facebook\\u2019s board \\u2014 has leaned harder on the term \\u201cWeb3.\\u201d)\", \"The current tech giants have resources, talent and industrial-grade FOMO on their side, so it would be a mistake to underestimate their influence on this so-called successor state of the internet.\", \"There are two predictions I feel comfortable making about the metaverse, however.\", \"One: It will not be known, by the people who inhabit its sprawling, distinct, yet-to-be determined environments, as \\u201cthe metaverse.\\u201d If we\\u2019re really doing our jobs in virtual offices, we\\u2019ll just call it work.\", \"Two: For most of us, missing out on a more thoroughly connected lifestyle, in which identities and work and sociality are further blended across physical and virtual spaces, many designed with profit in mind, won\\u2019t be the problem. It\\u2019ll be figuring out whether we can leave.\", \"For Context is a column that explores the edges of digital culture.\"]","href_hash":"723793923c1a11ecbd3c000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"723793923c1a11ecbd3c000017025a03"}},
