Coach Kyle Shanahan led his team through what felt like an endless loop of two consecutive losses following two consecutive wins, remaining steady in his approach \\u2014 and his flawed quarterback, Jimmy Garoppolo, who was just good enough to beat the Cowboys, 23-17, in Dallas on Sunday.\", \"Garoppolo was mostly steady and risk-averse, playing within Shanahan\\u2019s system and throwing accurate passes on third down. But in a game where both teams combined for 147 penalty yards \\u2014 and the Cowboys set a new playoff record for infractions (14) \\u2014 the late-game sloppiness gave way to what was the wild-card round\\u2019s most chaotic ending.\", \"The Cowboys, down, 23-7, at the start of the fourth quarter, executed a desperately needed fake punt from their own 48-yard line to keep possession. On the next play, Dallas tried to goad San Francisco into wasting a timeout by keeping its punt unit on the field, but failed to realize that the 49ers already had the majority of their defensive players, not their special teams personnel, on the field.\", \"Realizing the tactical error, the Cowboys swapped in the offense but could not get a play off in time and took a key delay-of-game penalty that pushed them to San Francisco\\u2019s 41-yard line, the edge of Greg Zuerlein\\u2019s field-goal range. The drive stalled after the penalty, and Dallas settled for a 51-yard field goal that cut the lead to 23-10.\", \"On the 49ers\\u2019 next possession, Garoppolo was intercepted in his own territory, on an overthrown ball meant for Trent Sherfield that instead landed in cornerback Anthony Brown\\u2019s gut. Dallas scored on Prescott\\u2019s 5-yard rushing touchdown to cut the lead to 6 and forced San Francisco to punt on its next two drives.\", \"Gifted the game\\u2019s final possession with 32 seconds left, Dallas completed three consecutive passes and got out of bounds to stop the clock. Dallas looked to cut the distance to the end zone before attempting a final Hail Mary throw.\", \"On second-and-1 from the 49ers\\u2019 41-yard line, instead of throwing to a receiver or a running back again, Prescott tried for a quarterback draw, gaining 17 yards. But he mismanaged the trade-off between yards gained and time saved. In the rush to spike the ball, with 10 seconds remaining, the clock ticked to zero and ended the last-gasp effort.\", \"The head coach has to answer for how their team handles pivotal game situations, especially in the case of McCarthy, who does not call plays on either side of the ball but rather manages the game action. Sunday was not McCarthy\\u2019s first time bungling situational football in the 2021 season, but the loss will stick with Dallas\\u2019s fans and ownership.\", \"His top assistants Kellen Moore, the offensive coordinator, and Dan Quinn, the defensive coordinator, have drawn interest from franchises searching for head coaches, and it\\u2019s possible McCarthy\\u2019s staff will be emptied out by February.\", \"In that circumstance, Dallas will have nowhere else to look for an answer as to how this team found a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.\", \"Blowouts in the N.F.L. playoffs are rare. In the absence of an injury to a major star, teams are too good, too focused, and have too many yards of film on their opponents by this point to be overwhelmed or surprised by a breakout performance.\", \"That was not the case in the wild-card round, with the Buffalo Bills routing the New England Patriots, 47-17, Saturday night. The expanded postseason field, which added another team from each conference in the 2020 season, meant little distinctive play in the pairings between the No. 2 and No. 7 seeds, as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers dismantled the Philadelphia Eagles, 31-15, on Sunday afternoon and the Pittsburgh Steelers, whose quarterback earlier this week admitted \\u201cwe don\\u2019t stand a chance\\u201d ahead of their 42-21 prime time loss to Kansas City.\", \"The Los Angeles Rams won their third meeting with the division rival Arizona Cardinals, 34-11, in Monday night\\u2019s finale to the wild-card round, a disappointing coda that saw the Rams build a 21-0 first-half lead.\", \"There is no larger narrative to wrap around such unbalanced outcomes, and it is tempting to wonder if there was actually anything to be gleaned in this year\\u2019s wild-card weekend.\", \"There was: The Buccaneers can dink their way through as long as the defense holds.\", \"Tampa Bay learned it wouldn\\u2019t have its lead running back, Leonard Fournette, available for Sunday\\u2019s game, and was already playing without the receivers Chris Godwin and Antonio Brown, two of Tom Brady\\u2019s favorite targets. Still, the game could not have been teed up any better for the Buccaneers\\u2019 offense, stylistically.\", \"The Eagles lack the top-end talent to create big defensive plays, ranking in the bottom 10 in sacks, tackles for loss and passes broken up. Their soft zone coverage and inability to create much pressure gave the greatest quarterback to ever \\u201ctake what the defense gives\\u201d too much room to dink and dunk his way down the field. Brady finished with a sweatless 29-of-37 performance, including two touchdowns.\", \"Philadelphia led the league in rushing yards per game, but no team in the 2021 regular season threw the ball less often, and the threat of quarterback Jalen Hurts or any of the Eagles\\u2019 backs was not enough to manufacture alleys against a defense plugged by the gigantic combination of Vita Vea and Ndamukong Suh on the interior.\", \"Teams know better than to run against Tampa Bay: The Buccaneers saw the fewest rushing attempts of any team this season but still were in the top 10 in tackles for loss, remarkable efficiency for a front seven.\", \"The Eagles\\u2019 only strength played to a buzz saw performance by the Buccaneers\\u2019 defense. Hurts led all Eagles rushers with 39 yards, and a 34-yard touchdown in garbage time from Boston Scott inflated what had been a 3.8 yards per carry team average prior.\", \"Worse, Philadelphia could not manage to exploit its opponent\\u2019s most glaring weakness. Key losses have dogged Tampa Bay\\u2019s secondary all season, forcing the defensive coordinator Todd Bowles to try cornerback Richard Sherman as a safety at one point. In his second season, Hurts had worked hard to improve his craft as a passer, but some key misses of receivers streaking up and across the seams cost his team opportunities to gain big yardage.\", \"In the second half, Hurts\\u2019s indecision gave the edge rushers Shaq Barrett and Joe Tryon-Shoyinka time to flush him out of the pocket and force him to try to squeeze passes up the sideline. Hurts was intercepted twice, one a backbreaking pick before halftime when DeVonta Smith broke open on a double move before safety Mike Edwards undercut a low and late throw.\", \"Sunday\\u2019s contest was over in three possessions, with Tampa Bay scoring rushing touchdowns by the backups Giovani Bernard and Ke\\u2019Shawn Vaughn on two of its three possessions. Ryan Succop\\u2019s 34-yard field goal in the second quarter ran the score to 17-0, ending an 11-play drive in which Brady barely had to exert himself.\", \"While it was impressive to watch a quarterback in his mid-40s march up and down the field in the postseason, Sunday\\u2019s wild-card win didn\\u2019t provide any tangible answers as to whether Tampa Bay is equipped to defend its throne against the N.F.L.\\u2019s better teams, only that the team is wily enough to try.\", \"Rob Gronkowski still has some of the best hands in football, but he has lost a step and a half, making Godwin\\u2019s injury and Brown\\u2019s exit stand out in obvious passing situations. Jonathan Gannon, the Eagles\\u2019 defensive coordinator, brought a few blitzes in the second half and played zone coverage behind it, and Tampa Bay\\u2019s backup receivers couldn\\u2019t find the open windows downfield on which this vertical passing game thrives.\", \"Darius Slay and Steven Nelson couldn\\u2019t guard Mike Evans (117 yards, one touchdown) without help over the top, but the few times Philadelphia ran man coverage, there weren\\u2019t many other outlets available for Brady.\", \"By then, though, Philadelphia had already been buried.\", \"Rams 34, Cardinals 11: Matthew Stafford completed 13 of 17 passes for 202 yards and a touchdowns, notably with no interceptions, as Los Angeles advanced to face the Buccaneers in the divisional round. Playing without top receiver DeAndre Hopkins, Arizona\\u2019s offense wobbled and Kyler Murray finished with 137 yards on 19 of 34 passing with no touchdowns.\", \"Kansas City 42, Steelers 21: Patrick Mahomes demolished the Steelers, throwing five touchdowns scores and averaging 10.4 yards per pass Sunday, in what may have been the final game of Ben Roethlisberger\\u2019s 18-year N.F.L. career. Kansas City will host the Bills in the divisional round.\", \"49ers 23, Cowboys 17: San Francisco ran out to an 13-point lead and managed it handily until Jimmy Garoppolo\\u2019s fourth-quarter interception allowed Dallas to pull within a score. The Cowboys\\u2019 final drive featured a frantic 47-yard scurry that ended when Dak Prescott botched spiking the ball, with 1 second remaining to hurl a Hail Mary touchdown pass, and time expired. The 49ers travel to face the top-seeded Packers next weekend.\", \"Buccaneers 31, Eagles 15: The Eagles fell into a 17-0 hole early, and their vaunted running game was not equipped to shovel them out. Four players, including quarterback Jalen Hurts, combined for 95 rushing yards that mostly came in garbage time. Tampa Bay relied on rushing touchdowns to open up the field for Tom Brady, who threw for 271 yards on 29 of 37 passing, with two touchdowns.\", \"Bills 47, Patriots 17: Buffalo scored touchdowns on all seven of its offensive possessions to dismantle New England in as decisive a playoff margin as there has been in Patriots Coach Bill Belichick\\u2019s tenure. Bills quarterback Josh Allen completed 21 of 25 passes for 308 yards and threw five scores. He also ran for 66 yards.\", \"Bengals 26, Raiders 19: Quarterback Joe Burrow led the Bengals\\u2019 high-powered offense on scoring drives in their four possessions in the first half, connecting for touchdowns with receiver Tyler Boyd and tight end C.J. Uzomah as Cincinnati secured its first playoff win in 31 years. On the Raiders\\u2019 final drive, a controversial roughing the passer call gave Las Vegas a chance to score but linebacker Germaine Pratt intercepted a Derek Carr pass at the 2-yard line to end the threat.\"]","href_hash":"d26efa2b791e11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d26efa2b791e11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
