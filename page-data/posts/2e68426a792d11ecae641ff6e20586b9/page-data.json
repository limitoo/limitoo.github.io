Blinken said on Wednesday that Russia could attack Ukraine \\u201con very short notice\\u201d and warned of \\u201cconfrontation and consequences for Russia\\u201d if it does.\", \"Mr. Blinken made the remarks while speaking to American employees at the U.S. Embassy in the Ukrainian capital, where he landed on Wednesday morning in the latest show of U.S. support for the country\\u2019s embattled government.\", \"Russia is already supporting an insurgency in eastern Ukraine, and the decision by Moscow to position a huge force around the country\\u2019s eastern border was a source of enormous concern, Mr. Blinken said.\", \"\\u201cWe know that there are plans in place to increase that force even more on very short notice,\\u201d he said, \\u201cand that gives President Putin the capacity, also on very short notice, to take further aggressive action against Ukraine.\\u201d\", \"Both Kremlin and American officials sounded a pessimistic note after a third round of talks on Eastern European security last week, with one Russian diplomat saying that talks with the West were approaching a \\u201cdead end.\\u201d\", \"Against that grim backdrop, Mr. Blinken met in the morning with Ukraine\\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and later with its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba.\", \"It was unclear whether Mr. Blinken promised them any specific new measures of support to deter Moscow, or to fight Russia\\u2019s military in the event of a full-scale invasion, but a State Department official confirmed on Wednesday that the Biden administration last month approved an additional $200 million in defensive security aid for Ukraine. \", \"Mr. Blinken is set to meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, on Friday in Geneva. U.S. officials have downplayed hopes for any breakthrough at the meeting, which they have described as an opportunity to test whether Moscow is serious about negotiations. But the White House also said Tuesday that it hoped to highlight that \\u201cthere is a diplomatic path forward.\\u201d\", \"Russia has positioned around 100,000 troops along its western border with Ukraine, although precise estimates vary. On Tuesday, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said that Russia could \\u201ccould at any point want an attack in Ukraine.\\u201d\", \"Russian officials are insisting that the United States provide a formal, written response to a set of demands issued by the Kremlin, which included a legally binding pledge from NATO never to admit Ukraine as a member. \", \"U.S. officials have given no indication that Mr. Blinken will deliver such a document to Mr. Lavrov.\", \"Speaking at a forum in Moscow on Wednesday, Russia\\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Sergei A. Ryabkov, repeated his government\\u2019s previous denial that Moscow has any plans to move its forces into Ukraine.\", \"\\u201cWe will not attack, strike, invade, quote unquote, whatever, Ukraine,\\u201d Mr. Ryabkov said. He said the Russian troops around Ukraine\\u2019s border were conducting training exercises. \", \"Also on Wednesday, Mr. Kuleba spoke by phone with Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union\\u2019s top diplomat, about economic sanctions the bloc could impose on Russia and additional financial support for Ukraine, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said.\", \"\\u201cEvery country in the European Union should understand that, though the price of deterring Russia is high, the cost of stopping a new war will be higher\\u201d if it starts, Mr. Kuleba said after the call, local media reported.\", \"Mr. Kuleba said the two discussed economic policies to both deter Russia and to support Ukraine. The European diplomat, \\u201cagreed that one of Russia\\u2019s goals is to destabilize Ukraine\\u201d economically and that the European Union was ready to help, Mr. Kuleba said.\", \"\"]","href_hash":"2e68426a792d11ecae641ff6e20586b9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2e68426a792d11ecae641ff6e20586b9"}},
