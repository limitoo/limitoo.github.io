Quite a contrast from some other young women who become mothers without thinking about anything much, like whether a man \\u2014 or a woman \\u2014 is likely to stick around to help out. Or whether, besides finding babies cute, she really likes them. Or whether, as the children grow, she will continue to like them \\u2014 and their needs.\", \"All of that can be hard to predict, but before making a decision that not only changes one\\u2019s life but also creates a life that demands so much, one should stop to consider more than most do.\", \"When I was young, I wrote a cover story about all of that in the long-defunct Look magazine.

They don\\u2019t like the nature of the work. They don\\u2019t like the cost. They don\\u2019t like not sleeping much. Etc., etc. Then, as we all know, bad things can happen, both to the unloving mother and the unloved child.\", \"I myself wound up not having children because I got breast cancer and my doctor warned me that it would be dangerous for me to get pregnant. And things worked out just fine. I finally married someone I adored, and we had almost 42 blissful years loving each other and loving our work and feeling lucky.\", \"Last year, while he was on his way to dying, he used to joke that it might be helpful to adopt a 60-year-old.

They do not ask about cases per 100,000 people or the positivity rate or what percentage of our county is vaccinated. They just wear their masks.
