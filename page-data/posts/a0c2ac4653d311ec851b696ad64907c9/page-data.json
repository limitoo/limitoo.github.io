Scientists now fear that the new variant\\u2019s threat lies in how susceptible populations will be to it.\", \"Scientists have estimated that as many as 24 million people of the 60 million people in South Africa were previously infected with the coronavirus, and 36 percent have been vaccinated. Despite that, the data show many people are still getting sick, suggesting to the scientists that some people are being reinfected.\", \"\\u201cWe believe that previous infection does not provide them protection from infection due to Omicron,\\u201d said Anne von Gottberg, a microbiologist at South Africa\\u2019s National Institute for Communicable Diseases.\", \"Previous infection offered a degree of protection against the Beta and Delta variants but reinfection has increased since the detection of the Omicron variant, said Ms. Von Gottberg, speaking during a briefing held by the W.H.O.\\u2019s regional office in Africa.\", \"While the reinfection rate is difficult to quantify at this early stage, \\u201cit looks more than what the model would predict,\\u201d she added.\", \"Previous infections will \\u201chopefully\\u201d provide some protection against severe disease, hospitalizations and death, Ms. Von Gottberg said of early analysis of the variant\\u2019s spread in South Africa.\", \"South Africa recorded a total of 11,535 new cases of coronavirus in the last 24 hours, according to data published on Thursday. The government did not yet say how many of the cases were of the new variant. While hospitalizations have increased in South Africa, only 4.1 percent of intensive care unit beds are occupied by patients diagnosed with Covid-19, a W.H.O. official said.\", \"South Africa has also seen an uptick in daily vaccinations after the announcement of the detection of the Omicron variant a week ago, though not yet at the targets set by the government.\", \"\\u201cVaccines have always held out to prevent severe disease and admissions into hospitals and death,\\u201d said Ms. Von Gottberg.\", \"The W.H.O. said it will also support the critical response and support genomic sequencing efforts in southern Africa.\"]","href_hash":"a0c2ac4653d311ec851b696ad64907c9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a0c2ac4653d311ec851b696ad64907c9"}},
