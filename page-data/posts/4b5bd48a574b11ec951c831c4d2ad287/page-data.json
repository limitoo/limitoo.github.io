Oklahoma when it sank during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.\", \"Using DNA taken from a nephew, the Pentagon was finally able to identify the remains of the 25-year-old sailor in 2020. They were released in July from a Defense Department laboratory at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and taken to Atkinson, in north central Nebraska, where Mr. Tushla was buried alongside his parents.\", \"\\u201cIt brings a sense of a realization of the great sacrifice that they made,\\u201d Msgr. James Gilg, 80, whose father was a first cousin of Mr. Tushla, said in an interview on Monday.\", \"As the nation observes the 80th anniversary of the attack that drew the United States into World War II, the military said this week that a six-year project to identify those killed on the Oklahoma had matched human remains from the ship with the names of 355 sailors and Marines.\", \"Thirty-three of the ship\\u2019s crew members could not be identified by comparing remains with DNA samples from relatives or dental records as part of the project, which began in 2015 and which officials said had ended.\", \"According to the Pentagon, those remains will be reinterred on Tuesday at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, a site nicknamed the Punchbowl. In total, 429 crew members from the Oklahoma died after several torpedoes struck the ship. Nearly three times as many service members died aboard the U.S.S. Arizona, which suffered the heaviest losses in the attack.\", \"Civilian researchers and military commanders discussed the project\\u2019s findings during a news conference on Monday at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii. They said that 13,000 bones had been analyzed and inventoried after the military received approval to disinter them in 2015.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s our responsibility as a nation to bring these sailors and Marines home to their families,\\u201d Capt. Robert McMahon, the head of the Navy\\u2019s casualty office, said during the conference. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve sent them off to war.\\u201d\", \"The unprovoked attack on Pearl Harbor killed more than 2,400 Americans and struck a blow to the Navy\\u2019s Pacific fleet, which had been based at Pearl Harbor. It hastened the United States\\u2019 entry into World War II, with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt calling Dec. 7 a date that \\u201cwill live in infamy.\\u201d The next day, Congress declared war against Japan.\", \"For decades, efforts to identify the remains of sailors and Marines entombed in the sunken ships were hampered by lost records and the difficulty of accessing their watery graves, which some family members had said should not be disturbed.\", \"But advances in genetic testing gave families and the military new optimism. In addition to the 355 sailors and Marines who were identified during the project, six names were matched from 2007 to 2010, researchers said.\", \"\\u201cThree hundred and sixty-one families now have answers,\\u201d Kelly McKeague, the director of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency for the Pentagon, said during the news conference.\", \"Carrie LeGarde, the lead anthropologist for the project, said that some of the medical and dental records for the crew members were lost in the ship.\", \"\\u201cFor some of these service members, it can be difficult to find a living biological relative,\\u201d Ms. LeGarde said.\", \"The remains of nearly 82,000 U.S. service members from several wars still have not been identified, the vast majority of whom are from World War II, according to the Pentagon. Separate efforts to identify crew members of the U.S.S. California and the U.S.S. West Virginia, which were also attacked by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor, are continuing, military officials said.\", \"Even though several generations have passed since Pearl Harbor, Ms. LeGarde said, some of the Oklahoma\\u2019s crew members have living sisters, brothers, nieces and nephews who are often quick to share stories about their relatives.\", \"\\u201cThe work that we do is for them,\\u201d she said.\", \"Timothy McMahon, the director of DNA Operations for the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System, said on Monday that those who worked on the project were each given a key chain with the photograph of a service member whose remains had not been identified.\", \"About 100 of the Oklahoma\\u2019s crew members who were identified still have not been reinterred, according to the military, which attributed some of those delays to the coronavirus pandemic.\", \"Mr. Tushla\\u2019s family members received notification in 2020 that his remains had been identified. That came in time for them to plan a funeral in conjunction with an extended family reunion that was held this summer.\", \"His relatives prepared an obituary, which said that he had worked on a farm before joining the Navy.
