the sports themselves, and the venues they are played in, to be proactive in calling out such behaviour.\", \"Instead of the victims or targets of racial abuse having to shoulder the burden of reporting incidents, the AHRC hopes venues, sports bodies\\u00a0and clubs\\u00a0all sign on to a new national framework designed to make the industry itself responsible for fighting the scourge.\", \"When Indian cricketers Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah were subjected to consecutive days of abuse during January's Sydney test match, the AHRC convened a roundtable discussion with Cricket Australia and other major sporting codes and organisations.\", \"The result is the \\\"Guidelines for addressing spectator racism in sport\\\",\\u00a0encouraging sports to commit to a zero-tolerance approach to racial discrimination and racial vilification.\", \"Suggestions include appointing game-day integrity officers and the training of players, officials, and staff in identifying referral pathways and de-escalation techniques.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Racism in sport an ongoing issue</div>\", \"\\\"Sport holds a unique place in our society, for some it's a religion \\u2026 unfortunately racism in sport remains an ongoing issue,\\\" Race Discrimination Commissioner Chin Tan told The Ticket.\", \"\\\"What the Guidelines seek to do \\u2026 is provide clarity and consistency in responding to spectator racism when it occurs and to send a unified message that racism will not be tolerated whether it happens at cricket, football, tennis or any other sporting event.\\\"\", \"The Commissioner said racism at sporting events is \\\"still a significant problem\\\",\\u00a0but instead of dealing with issues on an ad-hoc basis, the collaboration between sports means a quick, consistent approach will now be adopted by signatories with a focus on supporting victims.\", \"For Cricket Australia's inclusion and diversity manager, Rana Hussain, the guidelines mean much more than a set of systems and processes, the issue is deeply personal.\", \"\\\"Growing up, I loved going to the MCG\\u00a0but I have to say, it was often quite terrifying because it wasn't a safe environment,\\\" she said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">There are 20 organisations joining as signatories\\u00a0</div>\", \"Joining Cricket Australia are 19 other sports organisations and venues as the first group of signatories to the guidelines.\", \"The AFL's executive general manager for inclusion and social policy, Tanya Hosch, said the sport is \\\"proud to partner with other sports\\\"\\u00a0as one of the original signatories.\", \"\\\"We see the guidelines as an extension of the work already undertaken to prevent and respond to any incidents of racism at football matches.\\\"\", \"The AFL introduced a discrimination and vilification policy back in 1995 but ongoing incidents of racism in the game prove how difficult it is to combat.\", \"The AFL is not alone.\", \"The AHRC believes that with sports working in unison, along with the support of venue operators, the industry can make headway.\", \"\\\"[Sport] is a leader in the field \\u2026 and therefore provides us with the opportunity to say, how do we address this by providing the best possible avenue where people can watch the game safely and where other people involved in the sport can be protected as well?\\\" Mr Tan said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Creating change at a grassroots level</div>\", \"While social media and public scrutiny of professional sport have made it difficult for incidents of racism to be ignored, it is not the case in lower-tier and community sport.\", \"The guidelines did not come soon enough for former coach of the Waratah Mayfield Cheetah's women's rugby league team in Newcastle, Sheridan Noble.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3eb009045df7c2e0d60d48f8c1e11c4a\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Sheridan Noble coached\\u00a0players from 11 different cultural backgrounds, several of whom were racially abused.(Supplied)</div>\", \"In 2020, the team she coached had players from 11 different cultural backgrounds, several of whom were racially abused.\", \"\\\"One of the girls was saying her little niece was there and they heard [the crowd] calling them 'black dogs' and all this other stuff,\\\" Noble said.\", \"A report was forwarded to the NSWRL but with no involvement in the process, nor feedback on the findings, there was no sense of resolution.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b198c5bf6d9896c8047a352f09f14d50\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Players were subject to racial abuse, which was escalated to the NSWRL but there was no sense of resolution.\\u00a0(Supplied)</div>\", \"\\\"We didn't follow up with a formal process with the Human Rights Commission, but I wish I did \\u2026\\u00a0we did not get the opportunity for mediation, which would have been beneficial for all.\", \"Noble hopes the guidelines will make it easier for others in the future to have issues dealt with quickly and respectively.\", \"\\\"You just become so worn out because you just feel like you're fighting an uphill battle that's never going to change and you're never going to win.\", \"Mr Tan believes sporting bodies \\u2014 at any level \\u2014 can no longer escape scrutiny.\", \"\\\"In a day and age like this, it is hard to imagine there would be too many sporting organisations, that are responsible, that have a sense of this duty and the issues around racism, not wanting to be involved in participating in programs that help to eliminate and eradicate racism.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"5caaec86470a11ecb3c55d746789f558"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5caaec86470a11ecb3c55d746789f558"}},
