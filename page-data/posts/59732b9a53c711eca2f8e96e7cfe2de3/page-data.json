Democracy, she said, \\u201cdepends on solidarity and trust, including the trust in facts.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Merkel counseled vigilance.\", \"\\u201cWherever scientific insight is denied and conspiracy theories and hatred are spread, we need to resist,\\u201d she said. \\u201cOur democracy also depends on the fact that where hatred and violence are seen as a legitimate means to force through certain interests, our tolerance as democrats must find its limits.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Merkel remarked on the symbolic location of the ceremony: The courtyard of the Bendlerblock, a building that is now part of the defense ministry but was once the headquarters of a resistance group of officers who had carried out the plot against Adolf Hitler in 1944 and were executed.\", \"The ceremony, broadcast live on television and hosted by the defense minister, lasted about an hour, rich in military choreography and ritual. Known as the Grosser Zapfenstreich, or Grand Tattoo, it dates to the 16th century and is the highest honor the military can bestow on civilians. It has been performed as the official farewell to departing chancellors since German reunification.\", \"The highlight was the military marching band playing three songs picked by the chancellor. Her predecessors, Helmut Kohl and Gerhard Schr\\u00f6der, asked for Beethoven and Frank Sinatra, among other conventional fare. But one of Ms. Merkel\\u2019s choices intrigued many.\", \"There was a Christian hymn \\u2014 little surprise, for the daughter of a Protestant pastor \\u2014 and a conventional enough cabaret song by the German actress and singer Hildegard Knef.\", \"It was Ms. Merkel\\u2019s third choice that set the German Twittersphere alight. The chancellor picked \\u201cDu hast den Farbfilm vergessen,\\u201d or \\u201cYou Forgot the Color Film,\\u201d a 1970s hit from the Communist East by Nina Hagen, who later emigrated to the West and became Germany\\u2019s punk rock idol of the 1980s.\", \"Until recently, Ms. Merkel had rarely spoken about her East German background. But she was more forthcoming on Thursday when asked about the song, which tells the tale of a couple going on holiday on an island in the Baltic Sea.\", \"\\u201cThe song was a highlight of my youth, which as everyone knows took place in the G.D.R.,\\u201d Ms. Merkel said, referring to the German Democratic Republic, the official name of Communist East Germany. \\u201cThe song came from the G.D.R., and as it happens, it also takes place in a region that was in my former constituency. And so it all fits together.\\u201d\", \"Compared to her predecessors, Ms. Merkel invited relatively few guests, owing to the pandemic. Mr. Scholz was in the crowd, as were many of the 52 ministers who served in her governments over four terms.\", \"At times, there was a hint of emotion in the usually stoic chancellor\\u2019s face.\", \"\\u201cIf I stand before you today, I feel above all gratefulness and humility,\\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \\u201cThe 16 years as chancellor were eventful and often challenging years. They challenged me politically and personally, and at the same time they always fulfilled me.\\u201d\", \"Right at the end of her speech, the chancellor turned to her successor, Mr. Scholz, a Social Democrat, who had served as her finance minister for the past four years.\", \"\\u201cNow it is up to the next government to find answers to the challenges that lie ahead and shape our future,\\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \\u201cFor that I wish you, dear Olaf Scholz and the government you will lead, all the best and a lucky hand and much success.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"59732b9a53c711eca2f8e96e7cfe2de3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"59732b9a53c711eca2f8e96e7cfe2de3"}},
