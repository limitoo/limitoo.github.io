Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, Nov. 15-21. Details and times are subject to change.\", \"HOLIDAY BAKING CHAMPIONSHIP: GINGERBREAD SHOWDOWN 9 p.m. on Food Network. There may be few culinary situations more intense than baking for blood relatives. Food Network nods at that fact with this holiday baking competition show, which kicks off Monday night by challenging its contestants to make snow globe scenes out of coconut shavings and gingerbread.\", \"SIMPLE AS WATER (2021) 9 p.m. on HBO. The Oscar-winning documentarian Megan Mylan gives an intricate, intimate look at the effect that the civil war in Syria has had on families in this ambitious documentary. Mylan follows an array of Syrian families whose lives have been changed by the war. They include a woman and four children living in a refugee camp in Greece; a man working as a delivery driver in Pennsylvania while applying for asylum for himself and his younger brother; and a husband and wife in Masyaf, in northwest Syria.\", \"\\u201cThese stories avoid triteness by lingering on the daily, unassuming routines of their characters,\\u201d Claire Shaffer wrote in her review for The New York Times. The result, Shaffer said, is a film that\\u2019s \\u201canything but simple when it comes to its technical achievements, weaving together familiar immigrant narratives in ways that still manage to surprise and stun.\\u201d\", \"HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER\\u2019S STONE (2001) 6:30 p.m. on Syfy. This first movie in the \\u201cHarry Potter\\u201d franchise hit theaters 20 years ago this month. The movie made celebrities out of its three young stars, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, and defined the look of the so-called wizarding world in which the stories are set, which until that point had existed only in readers\\u2019 imaginations.\", \"In a recent interview with The Times, Radcliffe reminisced about shooting the film. He looked back on some elements, like the use of practical special effects, fondly (\\u201cone of the great things about the films early on,\\u201d he said). Memories of, say, broom riding, came with more of a wince. \\u201cIt was a broomstick with a thin seat in the middle, and you didn\\u2019t have stirrups \\u2014 or, if you did, they were very, very high up,\\u201d Radcliffe explained, \\u201cso you were basically leaning all your weight onto your junk when you leaned forward.\\u201d\", \"BOOGIE NIGHTS (1997) 11 p.m. on Showtime. The filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson is set to roll out his latest movie, the 1970s coming-of-age story \\u201cLicorice Pizza,\\u201d next week. That new movie shares its setting with Anderson\\u2019s 1997 period drama, \\u201cBoogie Nights\\u201d \\u2014 both are set in the San Fernando Valley in Southern California.\", \"The story in \\u201cBoogie Nights\\u201d follows a young man, Eddie (Mark Wahlberg), who gets discovered in the late \\u201970s by a successful pornographer (Burt Reynolds) and becomes a star. The film, Anderson\\u2019s second feature, was how many viewers first discovered Anderson. In her review for The Times, Janet Maslin wrote that Anderson\\u2019s \\u201cdisplay of talent is as big and exuberant as skywriting.\\u201d Everything about \\u201cBoogie Nights,\\u201d she wrote, \\u201cis interestingly unexpected.\\u201d\", \"HIGH ANXIETY (1977) 10 p.m. on TCM. Mel Brooks spoofs Hitchcock as both the director and star of this satirical mystery movie. Brooks plays an anxious psychiatrist who gets accused of murder. The doctor\\u2019s quest to clear his name lets Brooks riff on scenes from \\u201cVertico,\\u201d \\u201cPsycho,\\u201d \\u201cSpellbound\\u201d and \\u201cThe Birds,\\u201d using the same brand of disgruntled humor he employed to great effect in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (1974), which TCM is airing at 8 p.m.\", \"GREAT PERFORMANCES: SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY REOPENING NIGHT 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). The San Francisco Symphony\\u2019s current music director, Esa-Pekka Salonen, finally got an in-person welcome last month, when he led a reopening concert that featured the contemporary dance company Lines Ballet and the jazz star Esperanza Spalding, and works by John Adams, Alberto Ginastera and Wayne Shorter. This PBS broadcast is built from a recording of that concert, which was performed in front of an audience at Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco. For those who watched Salonen\\u2019s virtual debut last year, it\\u2019s a step toward normalcy.\", \"2021 ROCK & ROLL HALL OF FAME INDUCTION CEREMONY 8 p.m. on HBO. Among this year\\u2019s Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductees are Tina Turner, Carole King, the Go-Go\\u2019s, Jay-Z, Todd Rundgren, LL Cool J and Foo Fighters. The ceremony honoring them, held last month in Cleveland, brought together an equally impressive range of performers to speak \\u2014 and sometimes sing. Among them was Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift, Angela Bassett, Dr. Dre, Eminem, Drew Barrymore, and Jennifer Lopez, all of whom appear in HBO\\u2019s broadcast of the ceremony.\", \"THE HUNT FOR PLANET B (2021) 9 p.m. on CNN. This documentary from the filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn (\\u201cThe Price of Everything\\u201d) follows scientists working on NASA\\u2019s newest space telescope. Scheduled to launch in December, the new telescope is three times larger and seven times more powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope, and is meant to be its successor. Its development has been long and complicated, which gave Kahn plenty to talk about as he gathered perspectives from engineers, astronomers and other researchers.\", \"2021 AMERICAN MUSIC AWARDS 8 p.m. on ABC. Cardi B is slated to host this year\\u2019s edition of the American Music Awards, which will be held on Sunday at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles. The pop singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo is the most-nominated artist this year with seven nominations, including one for artist of the year. The other nominees for that top honor are Ariana Grande, BTS, Drake, Taylor Swift and the Weeknd. Sunday\\u2019s ceremony is set to include performances from Rodrigo, BTS (with Megan Thee Stallion), Bad Bunny, Carrie Underwood and several others.\"]","href_hash":"91becbb445dd11ec9d6867df48848445"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"91becbb445dd11ec9d6867df48848445"}},
