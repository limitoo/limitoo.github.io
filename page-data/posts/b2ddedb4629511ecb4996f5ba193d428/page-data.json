Trump had lost the 2020 election was sentenced on Monday to three years in prison.\", \"The man, Robert Lemke, 36, sent texts and voice messages to about 50 people between November 2020 and early January. Several of the messages warned elected officials and reporters to stop telling the public that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had won the election, and said that Mr. Lemke and others were \\u201carmed,\\u201d federal prosecutors said.\", \"Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said on Monday that Mr. Lemke had targeted his victims \\u201cfor the perceived offense of stating the facts.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cRather than attempting to effect change through the lawful forms of expression that all of us Americans still enjoy, Lemke sought to quell freedom of expression, to intimidate and instill fear in others by threats of violence,\\u201d Mr. Williams said in a statement.\", \"Julia L. Gatto, a lawyer for Mr. Lemke, did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.\", \"On Jan. 6, the same day that Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, Mr. Lemke sent messages to the brother of Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a Democrat.\", \"\\u201cYour brother is putting your entire family at risk with his lies and other words,\\u201d one of the messages read, according to federal court documents. \\u201cWe are armed and nearby your house. You had better have a word with him. We are not far from his either.\\u201d\", \"Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, was also threatened, according to a letter she wrote to Judge Alvin Hellerstein. She said that after she spoke on the Senate floor on Jan. 6 about the importance of certifying the results of the election, she received a text from Mr. Lemke.\", \"The letter said Mr. Lemke texted her that the insurrection that day was the \\u201ctip of the iceberg\\u201d and described himself as part of \\u201cunderground communication networks\\u201d of retired military and law enforcement personnel.\", \"\\u201cWe are watching,\\u201d he said, according to the letter. Ms. Duckworth told the judge that \\u201cIn that moment \\u2014 and for weeks afterwards \\u2014 I was terrified for my family.\\u201d She added, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been forced to turn our home into a bunker.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Lemke was arrested by federal authorities in California that month. He pleaded guilty in October to making threatening interstate communications.\", \"Prosecutors said on Monday that he used \\u201cvarious electronic accounts\\u201d and at least three phone numbers to mask his identity when he sent threats. They also said that, despite his claims, he was not affiliated with law enforcement or the military.\", \"Mr. Lemke\\u2019s lawyer, Ms. Gatto, described him in court documents as a troubled man with a history of mental illness and alcoholism but no history of physical violence. She said he was \\u201cegged on by the incendiary rhetoric\\u201d on social media, from politicians and in news stories.\", \"\\u201cMr. Lemke was consumed with the narrative that the election had been stolen from Donald Trump,\\u201d Ms. Gatto wrote in a sentencing memorandum, which asked that Mr. Lemke be sentenced to the 11 months he had already served in federal prison.\", \"\\u201cMr. Lemke is genuinely remorseful for his actions,\\u201d Ms. Gatto wrote.\", \"Mr. Lemke\\u2019s case is one of several in which Mr. Trump\\u2019s supporters have been charged with threatening public figures for rejecting the false narrative that Mr. Trump won the election.\", \"Federal prosecutors have not publicly identified most of the people who were threatened in Mr. Lemke\\u2019s case.\", \"But the office of Representative Jeffries confirmed in January that the congressman and his brother, Hasan Jeffries, a history professor at the Ohio State University, were targets. A person briefed on the investigation also confirmed to The New York Times that the person referred to in the complaint as \\u201cJournalist-1\\u201d was George Stephanopoulos, an ABC News anchor.\", \"Mr. Lemke, of Bay Point, Calif., told Professor Jeffries that he was part of a group of \\u201cactive/retired law enforcement or military\\u201d that had \\u201carmed members near your home,\\u201d according to court documents.\", \"Professor Jeffries said in an email that he was satisfied with the sentence and declined to comment beyond a letter he sent to Judge Hellerstein.\", \"The letter said that the texts had created \\u201ca palpable sense of fear\\u201d in his home.\", \"\\u201cI could see it in my 11-year-old daughter\\u2019s eyes when she wondered whether the odd creak in the house was actually someone trying to break in and harm us,\\u201d Professor Jeffries wrote.\", \"He said that Mr. Lemke turned \\u201ca family\\u2019s world upside down\\u201d and \\u201cshook us to the core.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Lemke sent a similar text to a relative of Mr. Stephanopoulos, saying that the journalist\\u2019s words were \\u201cputting you and your family at risk.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe are nearby, armed and ready,\\u201d Mr. Lemke wrote, according to prosecutors. \\u201cThousands of us are active/retired law enforcement, military, etc. That\\u2019s how we do it.\\u201d\", \"Brian Stelter, CNN\\u2019s chief media correspondent, said in an article published Monday that he and a colleague, the anchor Don Lemon, had been among the journalists that Mr. Lemke had threatened. Mr. Stelter described one message he received from Mr. Lemke that included a photo of his father\\u2019s grave.\", \"He said that Mr. Lemon began \\u201cchoking up\\u201d while telling Judge Hellerstein that Mr. Lemke had called him \\u201chorrendous names,\\u201d including homophobic and racist slurs.\", \"\\u201cI am tired of looking over my shoulder,\\u201d Mr. Lemon said, according to Mr. Stelter\\u2019s account. \\u201cI am tired of being suspicious of even friendly faces in public.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Stelter also discussed the threats on Monday on his show \\u201cReliable Sources,\\u201d where he thanked prosecutors and the F.B.I. and expressed hope that the case \\u201creally is a statement\\u201d that trying to scare journalists into silence would not be tolerated.\", \"\\u201cThreats and harassment hinder a free press,\\u201d Mr. Stelter said. \\u201cThis is the type of harassment that journalists feel every day. It is pervasive.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b2ddedb4629511ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b2ddedb4629511ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
