So, for instance, the Federal Reserve could issue some monetary policy around issuance rates, address any inflation concerns and more. Senior Biden administration officials note that already there are more than 100 countries that are looking into issuing their own centralized digital currencies. \\u00a0Several agencies of the federal government have already begun researching the introduction of a U.S. digital dollar, but senior Biden administration officials stressed that this is the first time the federal government has taken a \\\"holistic\\\" approach to assessing a the possibility of a centralized digital currency, connecting both government banking institutions with departments and agencies focused on security considerations to mitigate risk. \\u00a0\", \"The digital currency announcement comes on the heels of a series of harsh sanctions the U.S. and its allies have been imposing on Russia as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, but senior administration officials say the timing of the executive order is unrelated. They say that that the use of cryptocurrency isn't supplying Russia with a \\\"viable workaround\\\" to dodge the battery of sanctions the Russian economy is facing. \\u00a0\", \"The new executive order will also direct the Treasury to develop policy recommendations taking into account what kind of impact a digital dollar would have on the U.S. economy. Other agencies will be tasked with considering privacy, security and potential negative climate impacts, given the enormous amount of electric power required to validate many types of cryptocurrency transactions.\\u00a0\", \"For instance, every bitcoin transaction activates thousands of supercomputing mining machines, all competing against each other to solve complex mathematical problems, each vying to be the first to validate that transaction \\u2013 and in return, earn some bitcoin.
