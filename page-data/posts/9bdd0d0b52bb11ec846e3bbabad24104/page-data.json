Drake.\", \"Much like the cover of Drake\\u2019s 2016 album, \\u201cViews,\\u201d which featured him perched moodily atop Toronto\\u2019s CN Tower, this image was first met with disbelief, a little bit of cringe and then an unending torrent of memes. The most memorable came from a onetime internet troll who has, over the past few years, risen to become one of the 35-year-old Drake\\u2019s musical peers: Lil Nas X.\", \"In a viral tweet, the 22-year-old Lil Nas X simply flips the gender: 12 emoji men, all pregnant, presumably by (emoji) Lil Nas X. Ever a canny self-promoter, Lil Nas X captioned the tweet with a reference to \\u201cMontero,\\u201d his own forthcoming album, which was to be released just two weeks after Drake\\u2019s.\", \"When it came to album sales, Drake won this battle. Like just about everything else he touches, \\u201cCertified Lover Boy\\u201d became a cultural juggernaut, moving more than half a million copies in its first week and spending several consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200 \\u2014 which meant that when \\u201cMontero\\u201d was released, despite a relatively strong showing, it debuted at No. 2. In a recent GQ interview, Lil Nas X admitted that he was at first disappointed by this chart statistic before he realized, in amazement, \\u201cDrake\\u2019s my idol.\\u201d\", \"In less quantifiable terms, though, \\u201cMontero\\u201d served as a reminder that a new, younger and entirely less predictable type of star is suddenly nipping at Drake\\u2019s \\u2014 and his entire cohort\\u2019s \\u2014 heels. Their playful competition is evidence of a dynamic that has been increasingly noticeable this year: the growing generational divide between pop\\u2019s millennial elders and their Gen Z heirs.\", \"For the past few years, at least within music\\u2019s A-list, the now-19-year-old whisper-phenom Billie Eilish has been treated by Grammy voters and critics alike as pop\\u2019s token Zoomer, shouldering the burden of representing her entire generation and all the changes it has wrought in the music industry. (Even she believes she\\u2019s won too many Grammys.) But this year \\u2014 on the Billboard charts, Grammy ballots and year-end lists \\u2014 a fresh front of Gen Z pop stars like Lil Nas X, Olivia Rodrigo, Chloe Bailey and the Kid Laroi have emerged and reached a critical mass. To quote LCD Soundsystem, and thus out myself as a crusty old millennial, the kids are coming up from behind.\", \"Some high-profile pop mentors have actively aligned with the new brood. Beyonc\\u00e9 has been championing the R&B sister duo Chloe x Halle since she signed them to her label as teenagers in 2015, and so it felt like a kind of cosmic torch-passing when the now-23-year-old Bailey\\u2019s sultry breakout solo single \\u201cHave Mercy\\u201d dropped the very same week that Queen Bey turned 40. On the ubiquitous duet \\u201cStay,\\u201d the 27-year-old Justin Bieber enacted a kind of pop-musical version of the Will Smith clone thriller \\u201cGemini Man\\u201d when he traded verses with his own younger doppelg\\u00e4nger, the 18-year-old mop-topped crooner the Kid Laroi \\u2014 who flaunts his precocity right there in his stage name.\", \"For all their stylistic variances, what these younger artists have in common is that they\\u2019ve all grown up on the internet, which means that their history of admiring or even \\u201cstanning\\u201d the artists who are now their contemporaries is well documented, always just a Google (or at least a Wayback Machine) search away. Lil Nas X was a member of Nicki Minaj\\u2019s formidable stan army and the prolific poster behind the Twitter account @NasMaraj. Olivia Rodrigo, 18, identifies as a \\u201chuge Swiftie\\u201d and considers her so-called \\u201cmom\\u201d Taylor Swift\\u2019s music so formative to her own that she interpolated the piano riff from Swift\\u2019s 2017 track \\u201cNew Year\\u2019s Day\\u201d on \\u201c1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back,\\u201d from her debut album, \\u201cSour.\\u201d\", \"But as Lil Nas X and Rodrigo have proved themselves to be not just one-hit wonders but formidable forces in the pop firmament, their relationships to their forebears have become a bit more complicated. Both Drake and Minaj declined Nas\\u2019s invitations to guest on \\u201cMontero.\\u201d As a child of the open-sourced creative ethos of the internet, Rodrigo\\u2019s open homages to her influences may have also backfired: Both Swift and members of the rock band Paramore were added as songwriters to her hits \\u201cD\\u00e9j\\u00e0 Vu\\u201d and \\u201cGood 4 U,\\u201d neither of which nod to their songs as directly as \\u201c1 Step Forward\\u201d\", \"Perhaps those results are not surprising: Both of these upstart artists are, after all, coming up against some of the industry\\u2019s most entrenched power players. But they also represent something thrillingly \\u2014 and, perhaps to some, threateningly \\u2014 new.\", \"As a Disney star turned hitmaker, Rodrigo has followed a markedly different \\u2014 and truncated \\u2014 pathway to maturity when compared to the rocky road traversed by her 29-year-old forebears Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato \\u2014 all of whom were still signed to the Disney Music Group\\u2019s squeaky-clean label Hollywood Records when they were Rodrigo\\u2019s age. Even though she will still appear on a forthcoming third season of the show her fame has since outgrown, \\u201cHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series,\\u201d Rodrigo\\u2019s decision to release \\u201cSour\\u201d on Geffen gave her certain lyrical and stylistic freedoms that allowed her to be truer to herself.\", \"\\u201cPeople ask me all the time, \\u2018Oh, did you just swear so that people would know that you\\u2019re not a Disney kid anymore?\\u2019\\u201d she said in a Variety interview earlier this year. \\u201cIt truly isn\\u2019t a calculated decision in my head. It\\u2019s not like, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m gonna be an edgy kid now.\\u2019 I just tend to have a very dirty mouth, and I think that obviously reflects in my songwriting.\\u201d\", \"Lil Nas X, as an openly gay hip-hop artist working in a genre that was in his own lifetime so one-dimensionally macho and heteronormative that it propagated the mantra \\u201cno homo,\\u201d has experienced a particularly radical ascent. Naturally, the way he has come to center his sexuality in his music videos and award show performances has ruffled some of the old guard\\u2019s feathers, but he also exemplifies a younger generation known for its open-minded views on gender and sexual fluidity. As he put it on The Breakfast Club in September, defending the joyfully subversive imagery in the music videos for \\u201cMontero (Call Me by Your Name)\\u201d and \\u201cIndustry Baby,\\u201d \\u201cI want the videos to be entertaining. And whether you like it or not, seeing men do different things than what men always do is much more entertaining.\\u201d\", \"As their forebears either evolve into maturity or descend into self-parody, I\\u2019d have to agree. Rodrigo has slotted easily into the blank space that Swift left when she began making less pop-oriented music with the albums \\u201cFolklore\\u201d and \\u201cEvermore.\\u201d (In some sense, too, she made a better Lorde album than Lorde did this year.) And Lil Nas X is able to nimbly avoid the most awkward blind spots of his idols, such as Minaj\\u2019s strange 2020 about-face \\u201cused to be bi, but now I\\u2019m just het\\u2019ro.\\u201d \\u201cSay that you a lesbian, girl, me too,\\u201d Drake raps lazily on \\u201cGirls Want Girls,\\u201d a \\u201cCertified Lover Boy\\u201d single that feels both gauche and outdated, more reminiscent of the shamelessly queer-baiting era when Katy Perry kissed a girl than when Lil Nas X made out with a man at the BET Awards.\", \"\\u201cI do feel like this newer generation of rappers who are coming in, and the ones who are here, are going to have to reshape their thoughts,\\u201d Lil Nas X told the playwright Jeremy O. Harris in a recent interview, when asked about \\u201cthe hypermasculine breakdowns that have been happening in hip-hop lately.\\u201d\", \"And to the Gen X rocker Courtney Love\\u2019s dubious claim that Rodrigo had plagiarized the cover of Hole\\u2019s \\u201cLive Through This\\u201d (which itself borrowed liberally from the 1976 film \\u201cCarrie\\u201d) in a publicity photo, Rodrigo was equally open-minded \\u2014 if gently barbed. \\u201cI mean, to be honest, I\\u2019m flattered that Courtney Love knows who I am,\\u201d she told Variety. \\u201cShe\\u2019s from a totally different generation, so I thought that was cool.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9bdd0d0b52bb11ec846e3bbabad24104"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9bdd0d0b52bb11ec846e3bbabad24104"}},
