But when that entrance finally comes, it\\u2019s marked in the score as \\u201crisoluto\\u201d \\u2014 resolute, bold, declarative.\", \"And it could hardly have been more so than it was at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday, when the cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason made his debut with the New York Philharmonic. Having sat patiently at his instrument during the introduction, Kanneh-Mason, 22, became suddenly animated, matching the ensemble\\u2019s grandeur with his own: fiery vibrato, dramatic phrasing, richly voiced yet crisp forzando chords.\", \"This wasn\\u2019t the Kanneh-Mason whom nearly two billion people saw perform at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018. Then, he was more restrained \\u2014 with the occasional expressive, searching look in his eyes, but generally measured as he played three short pieces. One of them, Faur\\u00e9\\u2019s \\u201cApr\\u00e8s un R\\u00eave,\\u201d has racked up millions of streams on Spotify.\", \"The streaming numbers for his latest album \\u2014 \\u201cMuse,\\u201d with the excellent pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason, his sister \\u2014 are much smaller so far. But that recording is far more revealing than the wedding performance of his sound and style, proving his gift as a compelling musical storyteller in sonatas by Barber and Rachmaninoff, whether charting thorny passages or soaring to emotional heights.\", \"That was recognizably the musician who played the Dvorak concerto on Thursday: a charismatic protagonist and a generous collaborator in chamber-like passages. But Kanneh-Mason could also be a bit of a ham, his extremities of expression sometimes tipping into an unwieldiness that, as he maintained the overall shape of a phrase, sacrificed intonation along the way. These passing errors, though, were less memorable than the grace of his bow gliding over harmonics, or the control and tension with which he was able to build long crescendos.\", \"After the standing ovation that followed, he announced that his encore would be a premiere: \\u201c3-Minute Cello Concerto,\\u201d by the 11-year-old Larissa Lakner, part of the Philharmonic\\u2019s Very Young Composers program. Delivered with the same sincerity afforded Dvorak, this work was a dialogue between soloist and orchestra, in varied episodes of Mozartean tidiness and melodies that wouldn\\u2019t be out of place on a \\u201cHarry Potter\\u201d soundtrack; Kanneh-Mason had his share of pyrotechnics in agile fingering, double stops, octaves and passionate legato. It has been heartening to see ever-greater attention given to the children in this initiative, whose work has been featured in widely attended outdoor concerts, pandemic Bandwagon performances and, here, a high-profile subscription program.\", \"The conductor was Simone Young, who stepped in two years ago after a long absence to lead the orchestra because its music director, Jaap van Zweden, burned himself with an ice pack, and is thankfully becoming a more regular presence at the podium here. Preceding the Dvorak was a brief opening in the form of the \\u201cFuga (Ricercata)\\u201d from Bach\\u2019s \\u201cMusical Offering,\\u201d arranged by Webern in a modernist showcase of 18th-century complexity; after intermission came Brahms\\u2019s First Symphony.\", \"With an ear for easily overlooked details and dramatic instincts that gave the whole evening a sense of drive and accumulation, Young subtly threaded elements of the Bach through the pieces that followed. By slightly emphasizing the section cellos in the opening of the Dvorak, she lent their part the brightly articulated counterpoint of individual voices in the \\u201cFuga\\u201d; later, in the first movement of the Brahms, Webern\\u2019s arrangement was echoed as a leading line was passed from oboe to flute and cello.\", \"Young led the orchestra with decisive urgency and refreshingly little over-the-top physical extroversion. (She had that combination of qualities in common with another star of the evening, Sheryl Staples, the principal associate concertmaster, who was heavily featured as a soloist in the Dvorak and Brahms.) Most impressive was the reserve Young employed in the opening movements of those two works. Substantial, and with spectacular endings, each could almost be a stand-alone piece.\", \"But Young withheld somewhat in both, preferring a slow burn that built toward truly stirring finales \\u2014 the galloping Brahms blossoming into a radiant chorale and popping chords that sent the audience, once again, standing to greet the music with enthusiastic applause.\"]","href_hash":"ac98b7fc43de11ec88fcc110f319de82"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ac98b7fc43de11ec88fcc110f319de82"}},
