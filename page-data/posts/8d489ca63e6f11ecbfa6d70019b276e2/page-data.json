polluting industries.\", \"The first CCS/CCUS\\u00a0projects started out small but have become much more ambitious in recent years, according to Kathryn Amos, head of the University of Adelaide's Australian School of Petroleum and Energy Resources.\", \"\\\"There are a number of CCS projects that work really well around the world,\\\" Dr Amos said.\", \"According to the\\u00a0US Department of Energy's Carbon Capture and Storage Database, there are 43\\u00a0active sites where carbon capture and storage is taking place worldwide, including enhanced oil recovery projects.\", \"That includes 10 in the US, five in China and four\\u00a0in Australia.\", \"Gas giant\\u00a0Santos has a $220 million CCS project in development at Moomba in South Australia, where it plans to store more than 1

distraction from the bigger picture.\", \"\\\"It's a 50-year-old oil and gas industry practice of pumping CO2 into the ground to force out more oil from depleted fields, which increases emissions,\\\"
