So, she's respectfully bowing out.\", \"\\\"I do hope the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame will understand and be willing to consider me again \\u2013 if I'm ever worthy,\\\" she said in the statement. \\\"This has, however, inspired me to put out a hopefully great rock n' roll album at some point in the future, which I have always wanted to do.\\\"\", \"A post shared by Dolly Parton (@dollyparton)\", \"\\\"My husband is a total rock n' roll freak and he has always encouraged me to do one,\\\" Parton said of her husband of 56 years, Carl Dean, who has successfully stayed out of the limelight despite his wife's star power. \\\"I wish all the nominees good luck and thank you again for the compliment.\\\"\", \"While the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame may seem like a rock-focused honor, Parton's fellow nominees this year included rapper Eminem and 80s pop duo Eurythmics. Last year's class included rapper Jay-Z.\", \"The 2021 inductees also included Tina Turner, Carole King, The Go-Go's, Foo Fighters and Todd Rundgren.\", \"Out of the 17 nominees this year, voters can choose five they want to be inducted into the 2022 class. The hall of fame recognizes artists for having contributed over 25 years of musical excellence.\", \"In the past, Parton has been humble when it comes to awards. In 2021, she revealed she has been offered the Presidential Medal of Freedom \\u2013 twice, by the Trump administration \\u2013 but she did not accept it.\", \"When asked last year if she had heard yet from President Biden, Parton\\u00a0told NBC's \\\"Today\\\" that she actually has. \\\"To be honest, in all fairness, I got offered the freedom award from the Trump administration,\\\" Parton said. \\\"I couldn't accept it because my husband was ill. Then they asked me again about it and I wouldn't travel because of the COVID.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Now I feel like if I take it, I'll be doing politics, so I'm not sure,\\\" she said, adding that she's not even sure if she deserves it.\\u00a0\", \"Parton created The Dollywood Foundation in 1988, which focuses on literacy and education in her home county of Sevier County, Tennessee. And her giving has gone global. In November 2020, it was revealed that she helped\\u00a0fund research\\u00a0for the\\u00a0COVID-19\\u00a0vaccine developed by\\u00a0Moderna. Parton made a\\u00a0$1 million contribution\\u00a0toward coronavirus research efforts at Vanderbilt University.\\u00a0\", \"Caitlin O'Kane is a digital content producer covering trending stories for CBS News and its good news brand, The Uplift.\"]","href_hash":"4262020ea3aa11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4262020ea3aa11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
