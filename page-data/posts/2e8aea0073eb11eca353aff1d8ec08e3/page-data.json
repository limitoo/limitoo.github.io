recommendation to delay the start of the school year by two weeks to February 7 due to the COVID-19 Omicron outbreak,\\u00a0and will instead use remote learning, starting from the original term date of January 24.\", \"On Sunday, Ms Palaszczuk\\u00a0announced changes to the return to school date for the state's primary and high school students because projections suggested Queensland would reach the COVID-19 Omicron peak in the last week in January.\", \"There are around 540 independent and Catholic-operated schools around Queensland.\", \"At this stage, only a handful of schools have told parents that online learning will start at the beginning of the original school term date.\", \"Terry Burke \\u2014\\u00a0from the Queensland branch of the Independent Education Union of Australia \\u2014\\u00a0said many schools had already planned last year for a disrupted start to the year and were set up for online learning.\", \"He said now was the time for schools to plan how they would deal with COVID-19 outbreaks with rapid antigen tests (RATs) being in short supply.\", \"\\\"Our concern is that schools actually take the time to use the additional delayed start to the school year,\\\" he said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c71286ed6db8c9aa95a96baa1c6db911\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Many schools already

parents], including illness, quarantine protocols\\u00a0and subsequent care of family members, may mean that remote learning for the full school cohort is unviable to deliver during this period,\\\"
