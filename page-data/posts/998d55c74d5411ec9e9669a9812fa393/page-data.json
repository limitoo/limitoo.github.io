Mendell, 51-year-old Sheehan pleaded guilty on July 20 to three counts of sexual exploitation of children.\", \"The Associated Press reported that Sheehan's victims were between the ages of 11 and 12. The case was a part of Project Safe Childhood, a U.S. Justice Department initiative launched in 2006 with the aim to combat child exploitation and abuse.\", \"Sheehan's actions came to light in June 2018 when one of his victims came forward. A search of his Norwell, Massachusetts, home followed on August 17, 2018. Police found electronic devices containing child pornography. After further analysis of the devices, they found video evidence of Sheehan sexually abusing three minors between 2017 and 2018.\", \"In a statement from the Justice Department, Mendell said Sheehan used his position as a youth coach to prey on vulnerable children.\", \"\\\"He manipulated and sexually exploited them for months, and for that he will spend the rest of his life behind bars,\\\" Mendell said. \\\"There are few crimes deserving of a life sentence, and this is one of them.

Video evidence showed Sheehan sexually abusing three victims who were either 11 or 12 years old at the time while they slept at his home on various dates.\", \"According to an FBI affidavit in the case, the video appears to have been recorded by a camera positioned on metal shelving near where the abuse occurred. At least one victim was a friend of Sheehan's son and was on the football team coached by Sheehan, according to the affidavit.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1769566/scott-lane-child-pornography-abuse-prison-sentence.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\\"[Derek Sheehan] manipulated and sexually exploited [his victims] for months, and for that he will spend the rest of his life behind bars,\\\" U.S. Attorney Nathaniel R.
