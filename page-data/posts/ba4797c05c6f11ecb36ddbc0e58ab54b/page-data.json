They stuffed the bills into their shirts as the crowd murmured.\", \"The giveaway \\u2014 organized by the Sioux Falls Stampede of the United States Hockey League, in conjunction with CU Mortgage Direct, a local lending company \\u2014 was swiftly and widely criticized as being demeaning to teachers.\", \"Critics said that no teacher should have to put up with the kind of indignity that unfolded at the hockey game. They pointed out that South Dakota ranks next to last in teacher pay, averaging $49,000 a year.\", \"Reynold F. Nesiba, a Democratic state senator from Sioux Falls and a professor at Augustana University, said on Monday that while the organizers of the giveaway were \\u201cwell intended,\\u201d the event was ill-conceived.\", \"\\u201cIt just seems insulting and absurd to have teachers doing an event like this to raise a few hundred dollars for their classrooms,\\u201d Mr. Nesiba said. \\u201cIt also seems disrespectful to the teachers. What other profession would be asked to fund-raise this way?\\u201d\", \"A video of the competition, which took place during the first intermission of the Stampede\\u2019s loss to the Tri-City Storm, had been viewed more than 14 million times as of Monday. It drew inevitable comparisons to the dystopian Netflix series \\u201cSquid Game,\\u201d in which hundreds of people facing financial despair play deadly children\\u2019s games for the chance to win millions of dollars. It was not the first time that a U.S.H.L. team sponsored a cash scramble for teachers: The Green Bay Gamblers held a similar event a few years ago.\", \"The Sioux Falls Stampede and CU Mortgage Direct did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday, but a spokesman for the lending company told The Argus Leader, a newspaper in Sioux Falls, that the company wanted to do something to help teachers after a difficult few years.\", \"\\u201cThe teachers in this area, and any teacher, they deserve whatever the heck they get,\\u201d the spokesman, Ryan Knudson, told the newspaper.\", \"In an interview last week promoting the event, Jim Olander, the hockey team\\u2019s president, told the television station KELO that each of the teachers had to explain what they planned to spend the money on as part of their applications to compete in the giveaway.\", \"\\u201cEvery teacher has a different reason, some of them it\\u2019s iPads for the classroom, some of them it\\u2019s just new equipment,\\u201d Mr. Olander said. \\u201cWe know this day and age schools are in need of funding, and we\\u2019re just trying to play a small part to help them out and have some fun while doing it.\\u201d\", \"The teachers each collected $378 to $616, The Argus Leader reported. In addition to getting to keep the money, $5 from every game ticket sold by the teachers went to their schools, KELO reported.\", \"Several of the teachers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday, but they told The Argus Leader that they planned to use the money for flexible seating, document scanners, e-sports equipment and other items.\", \"On Monday, the Sioux Falls Education Association criticized the event on Facebook.\", \"\\u201cEvents like this show that our educational system is broken \\u2014 not only in the Sioux Falls region but across the state,\\u201d the association said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for us to realign our priorities by focusing on putting the money back into our students\\u2019 education. No educator should have to crawl on their hands and knees to supply proper educational tools for our students.\\u201d\", \"The event drew the attention of Representative Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, who said it explained why he had voted against the National Defense Authorization Act. \", \"\\u201cWe spend billions on weapons systems our military doesn\\u2019t want, but teachers are forced to fight over $1 bills on the ground because our schools are so underfunded,\\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \\u201cAs a congressman & the brother of two public school teachers, this is shameful.\\u201d\", \"Bernice King, a daughter of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the chief executive of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, wrote on Twitter that she disapproved of the giveaway. \", \"\\u201cThis just should not be,\\u201d Ms. King said on Sunday, adding a quote from her father: \\u201cA nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom.\\u201d\", \"Writing on Monday for The South Dakota Standard, a commentary website, the columnist Tom Lawrence panned the way that the giveaway was handled.\", \"\\u201cYes, supporting teachers is a good thing,\\u201d Mr. Lawrence said. \\u201cDonating $5,000 to the cause is a generous gesture. And teachers sure need the money. But this was a bad look, a humiliating exercise for educators.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ba4797c05c6f11ecb36ddbc0e58ab54b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ba4797c05c6f11ecb36ddbc0e58ab54b"}},
