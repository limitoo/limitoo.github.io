He recruited Juwan Howard, now the Wolverinesâ€™ coach, to play for Michigan.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-02T15:55:56.000Z","content":"[\"SAN DIEGO \\u2014 The game came together at the last minute, not long before the start of the men\\u2019s college basketball season. Michigan had an opening because its plans to host Kentucky had fallen through, and San Diego State Coach Brian Dutcher called his Wolverines counterpart, Juwan Howard, to offer to fill the gap.\", \"Normally, this isn\\u2019t the way scheduling works. Matchups are set long in advance, marquee schools like Michigan with late openings often look to add easy wins before conference play begins and San Diego State boasts a sturdy-enough program that it usually demands home-and-home contests and rejects \\u201cbuy\\u201d games in which bigger schools traditionally pay underdogs for a one-time visit instead of also agreeing to a future game at the opponent\\u2019s arena.\", \"But in what will be one of the more emotional and meaningful early-season games, there is nothing normal about San Diego State visiting Michigan.\", \"Dutcher will step into the Crisler Center for the first time since March 1998, when he unceremoniously left the season after Michigan fired Coach Steve Fisher.\", \"Dutcher was the lead recruiter who brought Howard to Michigan three decades ago as the first brick in the foundation that became the storied Fab Five, a group some still call the best freshman class ever. Dutcher once watched Howard play for 28 or more consecutive days in July 1990 \\u2014 depending on who\\u2019s counting \\u2014 while wooing him and, over time, they grew quite close.\", \"Watching with a full heart will be the retired Fisher, whose own tentative first steps back after an estrangement from Michigan came just two years ago, when he was coaxed back for a 30-year reunion of the 1989 champions \\u2014 the only team to win a men\\u2019s basketball national championship for the university. (Fisher also took the team to title games in 1992 and 1993.)\", \"\\u201cI was anxious,\\u201d said Fisher, 76, for whom San Diego State\\u2019s home court is named. \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t sure I wanted to go or should go. But then I heard from all the players and I said you know, I should go, I need to go, and I went. I saw the people I wanted to see and needed to see. It was a wonderful weekend. Lots of memories I had there.\\u201d\", \"Sports often are fueled by memories and imaginations more than wins and losses. And the reverberations from one of college basketball\\u2019s most storied chapters still echo like the sound of a basketball bouncing inside an empty gym.\", \"\\u201cIt really is a wonderful thing to think about the nexus of how Juwan, Coach Dutcher and Coach Fisher are coming together in this game,\\u201d said Rob Pelinka, the Los Angeles Lakers\\u2019 general manager and the only man in Michigan history to play in three Final Fours.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s wild to think of the turns life takes, and coach Dutcher now is coaching against them in an incredible game,\\u201d Pelinka continued.\", \"A game, it should also be noted, that is more than simply a trip down memory lane.\", \"\\u201cWith them being the team they\\u2019re going to be this year, if we go in and happen to catch lightning in a bottle and get a win, it could put us in the tournament,\\u201d Dutcher said. \\u201cIt could get us that at-large bid. So it\\u2019s worth the gamble to go in there and not have a return game, just go in for a one-off game and build our r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9.\\u201d\", \"What should have been a story for the ages instead ended bitterly. Fisher was fired on the eve of the 1997-98 season \\u2014 long after the Fab Five departed \\u2014 following an investigation that revealed a booster named Ed Martin had given hundreds of thousands of dollars to four Michigan basketball players over many years. Martin died in 2003. The N.C.A.A. found no direct evidence of wrongdoing by Fisher. Michigan self-imposed penalties that included forfeiting victories and removing the arena banners celebrating the team\\u2019s run to the national final in 1992 and \\u201993.\", \"Following a season as an assistant coach with the N.B.A.\\u2019s Sacramento Kings, Fisher took over a historically moribund San Diego State program in 1999. He made one of his first calls to Dutcher. At the time, Dutcher was on a one-year hiatus from basketball, working in investing with his father, Jim, who was also a college basketball coach.\", \"\\u201cCoach Fisher said, \\u2018I\\u2019m taking San Diego State tomorrow and I want you to come with me. Promise me you\\u2019ll stay three years,\\u2019\\u201d Dutcher said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what he made every assistant promise, he wanted you to help build a program, he didn\\u2019t want you jumping jobs. And 23 years later, here I sit.\\u201d\", \"San Diego State was coming off losing seasons in 13 of the previous 14 years. But it also had a recently opened on-campus arena. Fisher identified the potential, led the Aztecs to the N.C.A.A. tournament in his third season and won 26 games, a school record at the time, in 2009. Dutcher\\u2019s recruiting magic continued with, among others, Kawhi Leonard. Dutcher, who was named head coach in-waiting in 2011, was Fisher\\u2019s assistant for 27 seasons before taking over the program in April 2017. He has led them to 20-win seasons in each of his first four years, including a 30-2 mark and No. 6 national ranking in 2019-20. But that season\\u2019s sky-high hopes were shattered when the N.C.A.A. tournament was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.\", \"\\u201cI was waiting for something I helped build,\\u201d Dutcher, 62, said, explaining his decision to decline other opportunities. \\u201cAnd it wasn\\u2019t hard to stay here. Obviously, this is a destination city. People save up all year to spend one week here, and I get to live here. My family gets to live here.\\u201d\", \"In his office are framed pictures of himself with Howard, now 48, from those Michigan glory days, as well as photos of his now-adult daughters \\u2014 Erin and Liza \\u2014 with Howard when they were little. The affinity between the families is real. The years have deepened the roots.\", \"Howard, raised in Chicago by his grandmother, still remembers Dutcher, Fisher and another assistant, Mike Boyd, eating his grandmother\\u2019s \\u201cfamous greens\\u201d during a home visit.\", \"\\u201cThat was very known as a personal dish in the Howard household,\\u201d said Howard, whose grandmother abruptly died of a heart attack hours after he announced he would attend Michigan in November 1990.\", \"Dutcher remembers he thought Howard \\u201cwas so important to the program that I spent every day that July watching him. Wherever he was, I was. So if he wasn\\u2019t at a camp or an event and was just home at the park, I\\u2019d go to the park to watch him play. Just to be with him, because I felt he was that important to our success at Michigan. Now, to have him as the head coach at the University of Michigan is just the greatest thing in the world.\\u201d\", \"That is particularly true in a time when the ice, ever so slowly, has begun to melt from the past to the present. Fisher had only been back to Ann Arbor twice before that 2019 championship reunion, to attend the funerals of the former football coach Bo Schembechler and the longtime Michigan basketball office manager Karen Beeman. On neither occasion did he visit the campus.\", \"John Beilein, Howard\\u2019s predecessor, took the lead in talking Fisher back to the school, with assistance from Pelinka, Mark Hughes, a co-captain of the championship team who now is an assistant general manager of the Los Angeles Clippers, and others.\", \"Beilein had developed a relationship with Fisher over the years as he went from coaching jobs at Canisius, Richmond and West Virginia, and made it a goal upon going to Michigan to bring him back.\", \"\\u201cWhen I went to Michigan he was one of the first guys to call and tell me what a great place it is,\\u201d said Beilein, now senior player development adviser for the Detroit Pistons. \\u201cHe was so genuine and authentic with me every time we\\u2019ve been together. When I left the Cavaliers two years ago he called just to see how I was doing.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t like that guy, I love him.\\u201d\", \"His return to the Crisler Center went so well that Fisher, who spoke to the basketball alumni and team during the weekend, both called Beilein and wrote him a letter of gratitude afterward.\", \"\\u201cTime is a friend of truth and it\\u2019s all working out right now,\\u201d Beilein said.\", \"The hope among many is that one day the Fab Five again will be officially recognized and the banners will appear back in the rafters. Especially, as Beilein said, with the N.C.A.A. updating its rules and perhaps realizing it should have done more for student-athletes in the past.\", \"Meantime, while Howard, Dutcher and others lobby for Fisher\\u2019s induction into the Naismith Hall of Fame, the modest retiree now stays involved with San Diego State and enjoys his family. He knows what he has done \\u2014 and what he hasn\\u2019t. Perhaps one day the Final Four banners will re-emerge and the final bits of ice will melt away completely.\", \"\\u201cIt would be nice if that could happen, but whether it does or doesn\\u2019t, I\\u2019m a people person and I pull for Juwan,\\u201d said Fisher, who will not be with the Aztecs on Saturday because personal reasons are precluding him from traveling. \\u201cBut I won\\u2019t pull for him on the fourth. I\\u2019ll hope it\\u2019s a tie and we play forever.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4fb1900c53cb11ecbd45b9c7e719abea"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4fb1900c53cb11ecbd45b9c7e719abea"}},
