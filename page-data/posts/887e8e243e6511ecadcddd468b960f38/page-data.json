But something that has changed since the Paris conference in 2015 is that it is not just Australia's failure to meet the targets set down for the Glasgow conference that has been on display this time around, but that government policy isn't even meeting the targets set down by the broader Australian leadership: everyone from our scientists to now even the business and financial communities.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/922691af0595ccee59870d9981694797\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Scott Morrison puts faith in technology for decarbonisation</div>\", \"Instead of making an assessment of where Australia's national interest might lie \\u2014\\u00a0not just in terms of reduced emissions but in helping the transition which is being forced upon us by markets and the rest of the world \\u2014 the government took a policy position to Glasgow completely framed by wedge politics and internal government political problems.\", \"On national security, what we have witnessed is even more troubling.\", \"In announcing in September the decision to dump the French submarine contract, and instead pursue nuclear submarines in a new pact with the United Kingdom and the United States, Australia was realigning its strategic view, we were told.\", \"This view meant we needed to have nuclear submarine capability, as well as a range of different forms of technology and armaments that only the US and the UK could provide.\", \"Bolstering this case was a campaign to portray the French as a partner that was not delivering on time or on budget, and that we would be \\\"safer\\\" with the US, firmly entrenched in a partnership in the region.\", \"Yet evidence to Senate committee hearings in the past fortnight have emphasised the French were indeed delivering what they had promised.\\u00a0\", \"Meanwhile, the Australian mishandling of the relationship with the French saw the US President publicly disowning the process; the Prime Minister was not able to have a meeting with Joe Biden at two major international summits; and Australia leaked an American national security document in an effort to try to prove the US was \\\"in\\\" on the deceit of the French.\", \"This was all in addition to the PM apparently leaking a text message from Macron which will do little to make other world leaders trust him in future.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">A seriously alarming development</div>\", \"All this is of particular concern when the passage of just of a couple of months has left grave doubts about the outlook for our strategic capability in the wake of the decision to so significantly rewrite our strategic policy.\", \"Not only do we now have a widely acknowledged \\\"capability gap\\\" in our submarine fleet until 2040 \\u2014\\u00a0on the off chance that we ever actually see these nuclear submarines.\", \"But no analyst will put up their hand to say these submarines will be built in Australia, and too many doubt whether there is the capacity to actually build them anywhere else, given the demands of other nations to build their own submarines.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d8f16e7ff5b08ac052440a93054c8ce5\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Can the submarines even be built in Adelaide?(AP:\\u00a0Jack Sauer)</div>\", \"This should be a seriously alarming development.
