It\\u2019s Super Bowl Sunday for a lot of Americans, even for those who have no intention of watching the Rams play the Bengals this evening. It\\u2019s a chance to make a carne asada that tastes of Los Angeles or Cincinnati chili, to devour chicken wings, nachos, guacamole and queso in advance of the advertising, the violence or just a quiet night reading Sheila Heti on the couch. I hope you\\u2019ll join us. We have plenty of recipes.\", \"Among them: this terrific new recipe for a classic Italian sub (above) with dressed onions, meats and cheeses, pickled peppers and shredded lettuce on a hoagie roll. I\\u2019m not generally snobby about ingredients, but I will say that a lot depends on the choice of roll. Secure a good one for sandwich excellence. No one wants a floppy sub!\", \"You could also make Texas-style chili. Buffalo chicken dip. Spicy tofu sliders. Whichever, you should embrace the notion of tailgating in midwinter today, no matter where you stand on the business of organized sports. The Super Bowl is a secular holiday right up there with Thanksgiving, worth celebrating just because.\", \"As for the rest of the week \\u2026\", \"It\\u2019s Valentine\\u2019s Day, so you may want to make steak Diane for two, but I like Yasmin Fahr\\u2019s new recipe for pasta with feta and green olives, briny and slick. It comes together quickly, with big, big flavor, and is just the thing for nights when time is short because you forgot to buy flowers for your squeeze and had to backtrack 40 minutes to secure some.\", \"Here\\u2019s a no-recipe recipe: roasted fish with ginger, scallions and soy. \\u201cMy husband eats food, but doesn\\u2019t love food, if you know what I mean,\\u201d one subscriber noted beneath the instructions. \\u201cHe LOVED this. I used seasoned rice vinegar, sesame oil, olive oil, ginger and soy sauce. And he couldn\\u2019t stop talking about how good it was. Definitely going into the regular rotation!\\u201d\", \"Midweek is a perfect time to try this soothing, not-at-all-spicy white soondubu jjigae, the Korean mild tofu stew, with sweet radishes and savory mushrooms. I like it with kimchi and rice on the side.\", \"Here\\u2019s a chicken soup with pastina that\\u2019ll delight both children and those who sometimes like to eat like children.\", \"And then on Friday, you can make like it\\u2019s the weekend already with this fantastic slow-cooker Sunday sauce (or stovetop Sunday sauce): pork shoulder, Italian sausage and meatballs, cooked in a heady red-wine and tomato gravy. Serve a Lucali salad over the leftovers, please!\", \"There are thousands and thousands more recipes to cook this week awaiting you on New York Times Cooking.

Or you can write to me. I can\\u2019t help with much, but I read every letter sent: foodeditor@nytimes.com.\", \"Now, it\\u2019s a far cry from chocolate chip cookies and oven-fried chicken, but Rebecca Mead has a fascinating article in The New Yorker recounting her move back to England, and the Multicultural London English her son is learning to speak there.\", \"You might want to read Olivia Milloway in The Bitter Southerner, on the green burial movement.\", \"And you\\u2019ll definitely want to see this @devourpower photograph on Instagram.\", \"Finally, here\\u2019s Depeche Mode with \\u201cStripped\\u201d on the \\u201cWogan\\u201d show on BBC, 1986. A different time! I\\u2019ll be back on Monday.\"]","href_hash":"8c94005e8cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8c94005e8cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}},
