Khangoshvili was a Georgian citizen of Chechen ethnicity. Prosecutors said that the slaying was a retaliatory move for his \\\"enmity toward the Russian state\\\" and involvement in the second Chechen war, Al Jazeera reported.\", \"The incident spurred the German government to oust two Russian diplomats, and Russia responded with a reciprocal move. The Berlin court that convicted Krasikov of murder labeled the killing, which worsened diplomatic tensions between Moscow and Berlin, as \\\"state terrorism.\\\"\", \"\\\"The central government of the Russian Federation was the author of this crime,\\\" presiding judge Olaf Arnoldi said. \\\"It commissioned the accused.\\\"\", \"The Kremlin has denied any connection to the killing and called the allegations \\\"absolutely groundless.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952340/russian-man-convicted.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A German court sentenced a Russian man to life in prison after he was convicted for a 2019 killing in Berlin that judges said was ordered by Russian federal authorities.

The case was dropped in 2015.\", \"Evidence reviewed by the court, including material unearthed by the investigative news site Bellingcat, showed that Krasikov had been employed by a Russian security agency and was likely asked to carry out the hit in 2019, Arnoldi said.\", \"A month before the killing, Russian authorities issued Krasikov with a fake passport under the alias Vadim Sokolov that he used to travel to Berlin, where he shot the victim repeatedly from behind with a silencer-fitted handgun near the Kleiner Tiergarten park.\", \"Witnesses saw the suspect throw a bike, a gun and a wig in the Spree River near the scene and alerted police, who quickly arrested him before he could make off on an electric scooter parked in a doorway.\", \"The court concluded that the killing wouldn't have been possible without unidentified helpers in Berlin, that Moscow had a motive for targeting the victim, and that Russian law permits the killing of alleged terrorists, including abroad if authorized by the president.\", \"\\\"If a business card belonging to a member of the Russian federal government had been found at the scene of the crime, it couldn't have been more damning,\\\" Arnoldi said.\", \"The ruling can be appealed.\", \"A year after the killing, German-Russian relations suffered another blow when then-Chancellor Angela Merkel intervened to fly poisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny to Berlin for medical treatment. Navalny says he was poisoned by Russian agents, which Moscow denies. After returning to his home country, Navalny was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation while convalescing in Germany.\", \"Germany's new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has called for a tougher stance toward Russia, especially over its military buildup near Ukraine. But Scholz has called for a new \\\"Ostpolitik\\\"\\u2014or policy toward the East\\u2014of the kind that his Social Democratic predecessor as chancellor, Willy Brandt, pursued during the Cold War.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952350/german-court.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A Berlin courtroom during the trial of Vadim Krasikov on Wednesday.
