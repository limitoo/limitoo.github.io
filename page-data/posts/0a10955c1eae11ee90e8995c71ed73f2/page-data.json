It had forced some of the country's poorest people to pay off false debts.\", \"Many were forced into worse financial circumstances - taking out loans, selling their cars or using savings to pay off a debt they were told they had to pay within weeks. Others described being vilified and feeling shame after being told they owed money.\", \"On Friday, a royal commission inquiry into the scandal issued its final report, describing the scheme as a \\\"costly failure of public administration\\\" with \\\"extensive, devastating, and continuing\\\" ill-effects.\", \"\\\"Robodebt was a crude and cruel mechanism, neither fair nor legal, and it made many people feel like criminals,\\\" Commissioner Catherine Holmes wrote in her 990-page report.\", \"A royal commission is Australia's most powerful form of public inquiry. This one ran for 11 months and drew hundreds of public submissions.\", \"On Friday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the previous government's scheme as a \\\"gross betrayal\\\" of citizens, which had harmed the most vulnerable.\", \"The inquiry found there were at least three known suicides as a result of Robodebt policy, and it was \\\"confident that these were not the only tragedies of the kind\\\".\", \"The deaths by suicide included two young men, Rhys Cauzzo, 28, and Jarrad Madgwick, 22, whose mothers gave testimony to the commission last year on their behalf. The third was not identified.\", \"Kath Madgwick had previously told the BBC she holds the government responsible for Jarrad's suicide.\", \"Other victims told the inquiry how the stress of a debt demand had caused them anxiety and depression and led them to consider suicide.\", \"One woman said she felt suicidal for a period of months with the debt hanging over her head, with the \\\"lowest point\\\" being the day the debt collector debited the money from her bank account.\", \"\\\"I felt desperate on that day; it was so upsetting that I could not afford to pay for my daughter's medical expenses and I felt powerless to improve my situation,\\\" she told the inquiry.\", \"Another victim, who had experienced mental illness previously, said that upon receiving a $A11,000 debt notice, he was in \\\"complete shock\\\", because it would \\\"set me back years and years and years\\\".\", \"He explained that \\\"from a generalised anxiety disorder point of view, it's just \\u2026 the biggest trigger you can give to somebody.\\\"\", \"The inquiry's final report on Friday criticised former Prime Minister Scott Morrison's conservative government for launching the scheme where \\\"little to no regard was had to the individuals and vulnerable cohorts that it would effect\\\".\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nzhttps://rnz-ressh.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--tnzj803t--/ar_16:10,c_fill,f_auto,g_auto,q_auto,w_1050/v1669344333/4LHRF06_Scott_jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Australia's former prime minister Scott Morrison speaks to media during a press conference in Sydney on August 17, 2022. - Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on August 16 said that his predecessor Scott Morrison secretly seized control of five ministerial posts, labelling it an \\\"unprecedented trashing of our democracy\\\".
