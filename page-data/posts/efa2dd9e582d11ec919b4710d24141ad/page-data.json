Three weeks later, the church announced that he had been \\u201crelieved from pastoral duties.\\u201d\", \"In an interview this week, Mr. Duke said he had received enough critical feedback since the show aired to convince him he could not continue leading the church, which he said had about 400 congregants. He said that he was hurt by the negative responses but that he had also received hundreds of messages of support.\", \"\\u201cI experienced as much love and acceptance, and dare I say more, within the drag culture and the L.G.B.T.Q. community than most people would experience within the settings of the church,\\u201d Mr. Duke said. \\u201cNot one person questioned what I was doing there; it was complete acceptance.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Duke last preached on Nov. 14, a week after his episode aired. A local church leader said in a letter to the congregation dated Nov. 26 that Mr. Duke would be relieved from his duties on Dec. 1.\", \"The superintendent of the south and southwest district of the Indiana United Methodist Church, the Rev. Mitch Gieselman, wrote in the letter that he had received numerous messages both supporting and criticizing Mr. Duke\\u2019s actions.\", \"Mr. Gieselman said that the pastor had not resigned or been fired, but that his salary had been significantly reduced and he and his family would have to move out of the parsonage by Feb. 28. \\u201cWhile there is a diversity of opinion regarding the moral implications of Rev. Duke\\u2019s actions, he has not been found to have committed any chargeable offense or other violation of the United Methodist Book of Discipline,\\u201d Mr. Gieselman wrote.\", \"The pastor\\u2019s supporters created an online fund-raiser, which had raised more than $56,000 as of Wednesday morning. He said any money raised over the $30,000 goal set to help his family would go toward creating a new faith community in town that he hopes is more inclusive.\", \"The public split in this congregation came during a stalemate about rights for L.G.B.T.Q. members of the United Methodist Church, which has nearly 13 million members worldwide. Roughly half of them are in the United States.\", \"Ahead of a 2020 meeting of global delegates, a group of church leaders introduced a proposal to split the church, citing \\u201cfundamental differences\\u201d over same-sex marriage. But a debate on the issue has been delayed for nearly two years because of the coronavirus pandemic.\", \"The proposal, which would create a denomination that continues to ban same-sex marriage and the ordination of gay and lesbian clergy, is scheduled to be debated at the church\\u2019s general conference in August 2022.\", \"The interim pastor at Newburgh United Methodist Church, the Rev. Mark Dicken, said the Methodist church had \\u201cregrettably\\u201d been fighting over this issue for more than 40 years.\", \"\\u201cVery regrettably, the extremely conservative wing of the United Methodist Church has crammed through rather draconian provisions in their attempt to control clergy and their ministry to L.G.B.T.Q. people,\\u201d Mr. Dicken said.\", \"Mr. Dicken worked at the church in Newburgh from 2004 to 2011 and came out of retirement to lead the congregation again.\", \"\\u201cThe tribalism and polarization that\\u2019s going on in our culture, particularly in our political culture, has filtered down into the church,\\u201d he said.\", \"In the HBO show, which was nominated for an Emmy in 2020, three drag stars, Shangela, Bob the Drag Queen and Eureka O\\u2019Hara, confront these divisions while mentoring people for the show-ending drag performance. All three posted messages of support for Mr. Duke after the news about him leaving his position became public.\", \"O\\u2019Hara, who was the pastor\\u2019s drag mother or mentor, said on Twitter: \\u201cCraig is an amazing person and deserves the same love that he shares with everyone around him.\\u201d\", \"The pastor, who used Joan of Arc O\\u2019Hara as his drag name, was nominated to be featured in the show by the Evansville Pride group. He said he had never heard of the show but decided to participate to share a message of God\\u2019s unconditional love and to support his daughter, who identifies as pansexual.\", \"He said the negative response from some members of the congregation was especially painful because of the way it hurt his daughter. But the family is \\u201csticking together,\\u201d he said, and has been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support.\", \"He said he was grateful for his experience in drag.\", \"\\u201cIt was real, it wasn\\u2019t vaudeville, it was powerful, as the words they taught me, it was fierce, it was authentic,\\u201d Mr. Duke said.\"]","href_hash":"efa2dd9e582d11ec919b4710d24141ad"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"efa2dd9e582d11ec919b4710d24141ad"}},
