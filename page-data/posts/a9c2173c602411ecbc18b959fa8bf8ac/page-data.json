Republicans \\u2014 helped along by Democratic holdouts \\u2014 succeeded in obstructing much of Mr. Biden\\u2019s agenda, including a major voting rights push meant to neutralize new restrictions their party has enacted at the state level. Democrats accused them of an assault on the foundations of democratic pluralism.\", \"At times, Democrats tried resorting to bare-knuckled tactics to steer around that obstruction \\u2014 drawing charges from Republicans that they were trampling the rights of the congressional minority in ways that they would soon regret \\u2014 and still fell short of their goals.\", \"House Democrats, who hold a slim majority in their chamber, fumed at their counterparts in the evenly divided Senate for failing them, while Senate Democrats railed against two of their own \\u2014 Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona \\u2014 for grinding Mr. Biden\\u2019s agenda to a halt with their refusals to fall in line.\", \"The disappointments were impossible to deny. Democrats have been warning with growing urgency that forces loyal to former President Donald J. Trump have been moving the pieces into place to disrupt or potentially overturn the next presidential election \\u2014 through new barriers to voting, partisan election controls and gerrymandered House districts. Yet efforts to enact expanded voting rights, institute fair election rules or place any new controls on the presidency have hit a wall in the Senate.\", \"A self-imposed Christmas deadline to pass a $2 trillion social safety net and climate change bill through the Senate came and went, with one senator in particular, Mr. Manchin, looking increasingly intransigent.\", \"Other promises to overhaul the nation\\u2019s crippled immigration laws, force the conversion of electric utilities to renewable energy, strengthen gun safety laws and reform policing rules appear dead.\", \"Even raising the borrowing limit to make sure the federal government did not default on debt incurred under both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden could only be accomplished by the most convoluted of legislative machinations.\", \"\\u201cWelcome to the United States Senate. I\\u2019ve been here for 25 years and I\\u2019ve seen the decline of this institution to the point where we no longer function as we once did,\\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat. He added, \\u201cUntil we change the rules of the Senate and get serious about legislating on behalf of the American people, we\\u2019re going to continue to suffer this frustration.\\u201d\", \"Lawmakers from both parties blamed their opponents for the malaise hanging over the Capitol. Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, said any number of issues might have been resolved \\u2014 as the infrastructure issue was \\u2014 if Democrats had simply approached open-minded Republicans to find solutions.\", \"He pointed to an income security plan he rolled out in February that could have been the basis for negotiations as the Democrats struggled to extend their $300 child credit beyond 2021. No one even broached the subject with him, he said.\", \"Liberal lawmakers bristled at the accusation, given the Republican Party\\u2019s refusal to recognize the grave threat to democracy that Mr. Trump represents through his lies about a \\u201cstolen\\u201d election and the manipulations of the party ahead of the next elections. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said her party had \\u201copenly begged Republicans to join us in crafting a voting rights bill that we could all support, and they have consistently refused.\\u201d\", \"Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, scoffed at the notion that Republicans would have helped address climate change, raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and lower prescription drug prices \\u2014 if they were only asked.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s fair to lay the blame on Congress,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI think this is what Republican extremism is all about.\\u201d\", \"But beyond partisan finger pointing, few could argue the legislative branch of government was functioning properly. As long as most policy bills need 60 votes to overcome a Senate filibuster, Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\u2019s remarkable ability to corral her whisper-thin House majority will be for naught on most legislation. Though virtually all Senate Democrats are ready to change the filibuster rules, at least for some issues, like voting rights, they need unanimity \\u2014 and Mr. Manchin and Ms. Sinema aren\\u2019t giving it.\", \"Even where the filibuster is not a hindrance, Senate operations are dysfunctional. Democrats ended the filibuster on executive branch confirmations, yet a single senator, Ted Cruz, slowed confirmations of key national security officials to a crawl over his demand for a vote on sanctions over a Russian-backed gas pipeline. He then blamed the majority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, for failing to acquiesce.\", \"\\u201cIf Chuck Schumer wants to kill Biden\\u2019s nominees, he can do that,\\u201d Mr. Cruz, a Texas Republican, said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not clear to me why it\\u2019s in his interest to do that.\\u201d\", \"And some of Mr. Biden\\u2019s nominees tasked with addressing supply chain issues gumming up global commerce remained blocked by Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, who is demanding the commerce and transportation secretaries testify to Congress on those supply chain issues first.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s ridiculous that we\\u2019re in this position,\\u201d fumed Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington and the chairwoman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.\", \"In the House, two Republicans, Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona, were stripped of their committee assignments for social media posts that contained threats of violence against Democratic colleagues \\u2014 and a third, Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado, could yet be sanctioned for suggesting one of two Muslim women in the House, Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, could be a suicide bomber. When the House on Tuesday debated Ms. Omar\\u2019s bill to create a State Department post to combat anti-Muslim bigotry, Representative Scott Perry, Republican of Pennsylvania, accused Ms. Omar of harboring terrorist sympathies.\", \"Insults and shout-downs have become the order of the day. Ms. Taylor Greene showed up in September at a Democratic news event to heckle the majority party, calling them baby killers. In July, liberal protesters drowned out her and other far-right House members with jeers and taunts as they tried to hold a media event denouncing the treatment of those imprisoned for the attack on the Capitol.\", \"Indeed, the ill will on Capitol Hill cannot be separated from the Jan. 6 attack \\u2014 and the fallout from it \\u2014 a hasty impeachment of Mr. Trump that ended in acquittal and an attempted convening of a bipartisan commission to examine the attack that ended with a Republican filibuster in the Senate.\", \"Norman J. Ornstein, an emeritus scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, tagged Congress as \\u201cthe broken branch\\u201d back in 2006. But 2021, he said, started \\u201cwith not just a broken branch but a broken Capitol.\\u201d\", \"Senate Republicans had the chance in February to bar Mr. Trump from ever running for office by joining Democrats in convicting him of inciting an insurrection. While seven Republicans did vote to convict, the Senate needed 10 more.\", \"Ms. Murkowski said that the revelations since those events \\u2014 that some House Republicans encouraged the overturning of Mr. Biden\\u2019s victory, that Fox News personalities begged that Mr. Trump call off the riot and that the former president embraced an illegal, step-by-step effort to maintain control \\u2014 further validated her votes to convict Mr. Trump and create an independent inquiry. \", \"\\u201cOn the Republican side, there was such an effort \\u2014 we\\u2019ve got to get this behind us; we\\u2019ve got to get beyond it \\u2014 and in fairness, we have work to do every day,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut this was not just a bad disagreement over policy. This was this was an insurrection. This was a threat to our very democracy.\\u201d\", \"Other Republicans do not seem interested in learning any more about the riot. On Monday, Senator Josh Hawley, the junior Republican from Missouri who openly encouraged the rioters as they approached the Capitol, refused to discuss it further. \\u201cI\\u2019ve commented ad nauseam,\\u201d he said.\", \"The impact of that attitude on the rest of Congress\\u2019s workings cannot be overstated, Mr. Ornstein said. Congress has gone from a maddening institution hampered by intentional checks and balances to one that is driven by a quest for partisan power, he said, pointing to Republican efforts to cover up the roots of Jan. 6, and their refusal to punish members who threaten violence, or even acknowledge members\\u2019 efforts to overturn the results of a lawful election.\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t have two parties anymore. We have a party and a cult, and in a cult, the fear of being excommunicated or shunned is overwhelming,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s affected the behavior of large numbers of members.\\u201d\", \"Republicans have their own beefs. Democrats have barely opened legislation to the kind of amendment processes that once produced bipartisan bills. House Democrats have not considered a single bill under a wide-open amendment process. Under strict controls, Republicans submitted 1,995 amendments for consideration. Democratic leaders allowed votes on only 275 of them.\"]","href_hash":"a9c2173c602411ecbc18b959fa8bf8ac"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a9c2173c602411ecbc18b959fa8bf8ac"}},
