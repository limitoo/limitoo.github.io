The drop was much bigger than economists expected.\", \"The four-week average of claims, which smooths out weekly ups and downs, also dropped \\u2014 by 21,000 to just over 252,000, the lowest since mid-March 2020 when the pandemic slammed the economy. Overall, 2 million Americans were collecting traditional unemployment checks the week that ended Nov. 13, down slightly from the week before.\", \"Since topping 900,000 in early January, the applications have fallen steadily toward and now fallen below their prepandemic level of around 220,000 a week. Claims for jobless aid are a proxy for layoffs.\", \"\\\"Developments on the health front remain a risk that may weigh on labor supply, but we expect workers to gradually return to the labor market, as the cushion from savings diminishes, supporting job growth over coming months,\\\" Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist with High Frequency Economics, told investors in a note.\\u00a0\", \"Until Sept. 6, the federal government had supplemented state unemployment insurance programs by paying an extra payment of $300 a week and extending benefits to gig workers and to those who were out of work for six months or more. Including the federal programs, the number of Americans receiving some form of jobless aid peaked at more than 33 million in June 2020.\", \"The job market has staged a remarkable comeback since the spring of 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses to close or cut hours and kept many Americans at home as a health precaution. In March and April last year, employers slashed more than 22 million jobs.\", \"Job growth rebounded in October after two months of lackluster growth caused by the spread of the Delta variant. Employers added 531,000 jobs last month, while the nation's unemployment rate declined to 4.6%, from 4.8% in September \\u2014 the lowest since March of 2020.\\u00a0\", \"But government relief checks, super-low interest rates and the rollout of vaccines combined to give consumers the confidence and financial wherewithal to start spending again. Employers, scrambling to meet an unexpected surge in demand, have made 18 million new hires since April 2020 and are expected to add another 575,000 this month. Still, the U.S. remains 4.2 million short of the jobs it had in February 2020.\", \"Companies now complain that they can't find workers to fill job openings, a near-record 10.4 million in September. Workers, finding themselves with bargaining clout for the first time in decades, are becoming choosier about jobs; a record 4.4 million quit in September, a sign they have confidence in their ability to find something better.\", \"The decision by millions of Americans to leave their jobs shows the \\\"increasing confidence workers have in securing better-paid jobs elsewhere,\\\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist with Capital Economics, said in a recent report.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"c2f017ab4d3111ec866ea71e7f499e49"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c2f017ab4d3111ec866ea71e7f499e49"}},
