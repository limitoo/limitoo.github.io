But concerns linger that a full reopening could leave residents vulnerable to another coronavirus surge.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-27T10:26:55.000Z","content":"[\"For nearly 20 months, the roughly 1.3 million Americans living in nursing homes and their families grappled with strict visitation policies that, while designed to keep vulnerable residents safe from the coronavirus, caused distress for separated loved ones and had serious health consequences for many suddenly isolated seniors.\", \"Initially, visitors were barred entirely. Later, facilities enforced a variety of rules: Some prohibited visitors from residents\\u2019 rooms, allowed visitors only outdoors and during brief scheduled windows, or permitted only one at a time.\", \"Many of these restrictions were based on rules, known as \\u201cguidance,\\u201d mandated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that closed facilities to visitors in March 2020. It has issued several revisions since.\", \"Now all that has changed. On Nov. 12, the federal agency removed virtually all such restrictions and advised the country\\u2019s nursing homes to allow visitation \\u201cfor all residents at all times.\\u201d The agency noted that 86 percent of U.S. nursing home residents and 74 percent of employees were fully vaccinated, and that Covid-19 cases had fallen drastically.\", \"The update means no more limits on the frequency, time, duration, location or number of visitors. Access to residents\\u2019 rooms, unless a roommate is unvaccinated or immunocompromised, is allowed, and advance scheduling is not required.\", \"The federal policy still encouraged vaccination and emphasized infection control measures, including masks and distancing policies established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\", \"\\u201cIt makes an important statement,\\u201d said Lori Smetanka, the executive director of the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, an advocacy group that had pushed for such change. Previously, \\u201cfacilities were given a lot of discretion,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWhereas this is pretty clear: It puts rights back in residents\\u2019 hands.\\u201d\", \"While facilities can ask visitors about their vaccination status and encourage testing, they can\\u2019t require either vaccination or tests for entrance. Even during a Covid outbreak, under the new guidance nursing homes must allow visitors inside, albeit with masks. Visitors who decline to disclose whether they are vaccinated must also wear masks.\", \"The rules cover only nursing homes, which are federally regulated, but they may have a spillover effect. \\u201cI think many states will apply this to other settings, like assisted living,\\u201d Ms. Smetanka said. California, for instance, has already responded by loosening some assisted living rules.\", \"In nursing homes, with their frail and disabled residents, \\u201cthere can be precautions, but cutting off residents from their families was unethical and it was bad care,\\u201d said David Grabowski, a health care researcher at Harvard Medical School. \\u201cThese are not social visits.\\u201d\", \"With nursing homes short-staffed well before the pandemic, family visitors frequently helped feed, wash and dress their loved ones. They provided not only reassurance and stimulation, but also the ability to monitor the facility\\u2019s safety and quality. A study on which Dr. Grabowski was a co-author, for instance, showed that nursing home residents with dementia received better care at the end of life if a family member visited regularly.\", \"When the pandemic cut off such contact, for more than a year in many cases, families reported disturbing health declines. A study of Connecticut nursing home residents, for instance, found substantial increases in depression and unintended weight loss during the lockdown; incontinence increased and cognition declined.\", \"Trish Huckin spent nearly a year battling administrators at her 96-year-old mother\\u2019s nursing home in Pinckney, Mich., before she was allowed inside to make so-called compassionate care visits. Even then, \\u201cthe restrictions were ridiculous,\\u201d she said. The facility allowed her three one-hour visits a week in a public area, only by appointment. If she couldn\\u2019t make one of the prearranged times, she could not reschedule.\", \"When the facility finally eased restrictions, Ms. Huckin \\u2014 with her wife, a hospital nurse \\u2014 was finally able to see her mother, who has dementia, in her room. They discovered that in addition to losing weight and becoming depressed, her mother had developed a bedsore and early pneumonia.\", \"Claudia Hutchinson has also seen her sister, who resides at a facility outside Philadelphia, grow depressed and lose weight and mobility since her visits were restricted to an hour or less outdoors. \\u201cIf we\\u2019d been allowed inside, she wouldn\\u2019t have had this downward spiral,\\u201d she said. \\u201cShe wouldn\\u2019t be on hospice care.\\u201d\", \"Some doctors and families now worry that the pendulum has swung too far, that fully reopening will leave an already vulnerable population prey to another surge. Covid infections are rising in nursing homes; flu cases are up nationally as well.\", \"The day the new federal guidance was announced, a Connecticut nursing home reported the deaths of eight residents with serious underlying health issues from a late September outbreak.\", \"\\u201cTo have people tromping in and out during an outbreak, we know that\\u2019s not a good idea,\\u201d said Dr. Karl Steinberg, a California geriatrician and the president of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, which represents health care workers in long-term care.\", \"As a medical director or attending physician at three nursing homes, he saw the pandemic\\u2019s early toll: \\u201cIt was a blood bath.\\u201d He wished the latest federal guidance had left administrators more flexibility. Medicare might also have waited until after the holidays, he noted, and until booster shots were more widely distributed.\", \"Despite the removal of federal restrictions, some administrators think state and local health regulations may supersede the new federal guidance, potentially blunting its impact.\", \"\\u201cThe standard rule is that a facility has to follow the most restrictive rule,\\u201d said Dr. Noah Marco, the chief medical officer at the large Los Angeles Jewish Home. He is cautiously optimistic that in a few weeks the state and county will loosen their policies, too. But for now, the facility continues to require advance scheduling, limit visit length and permit each resident only one visitor at a time indoors.\", \"Since the new federal policy was announced, \\u201cour staff has constantly been on the phone,\\u201d Dr. Marco said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve had family members who\\u2019ve heard about this and are saying, \\u2018Yippee!\\u2019 We\\u2019ve had to say, \\u2018We\\u2019re so sorry, but not so fast.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"A representative for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said that state or local health departments might need to reinstate restrictions \\u201cdue to severe safety reasons,\\u201d but only in \\u201cisolated situations.\\u201d The representative added, \\u201clocal governments should generally not seek to add rules and regulations which limit a nursing home resident\\u2019s right to receive visitors.\\u201d\", \"The new federal policy \\u2014 bolstered by the Biden administration\\u2019s mandate that all nursing home staff members be fully vaccinated by Jan. 4 \\u2014 is likely to loosen more extreme local and state policies.\", \"Alison Hirschel, the managing attorney at the Michigan Elder Justice Initiative, has been advising a woman whose relative, in her 70s, suffered a brain injury after an accident and entered a nursing home a few months ago.\", \"\\u201cShe was very distressed,\\u201d Ms. Hirschel said of the advisee, who lives out of state. \\u201cShe had to drive seven hours for a visit, and the visit was limited to 15 minutes \\u2014 and only on weekdays during business hours.\\u201d\", \"Then, a day after the liberalized federal policy was announced, Michigan issued new guidance that allowed visits at all times, with no limits on the length of the visit or the number of visitors. \\u201cThis really is a complete game changer,\\u201d Ms. Hirschel said.\"]","href_hash":"6af67dd64f6c11ec8baa4d62fa3f3a26"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6af67dd64f6c11ec8baa4d62fa3f3a26"}},
