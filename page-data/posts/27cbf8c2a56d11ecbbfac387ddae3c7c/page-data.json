They're sequencing nearly everything that comes into a hospital or across the border.\", \"\\\"By contrast, we're sequencing less than 1 percent of current community cases, and we've only got about 10 to 20 percent of recent hospitalised cases.\", \"\\\"So we really need to ramp up this system and make it much more comprehensive and give us a much better picture of what's going on.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"27cbf8c2a56d11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"27cbf8c2a56d11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
