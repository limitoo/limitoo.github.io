About 2,500 buildings remained without power as of 4 a.m. Wednesday, the electric association said.\", \"Gov. Mike Dunleavy declared the storm a state disaster on Monday, allowing families to apply for disaster recovery grants. In addition to the windstorms, the cold weather, freezing rain and heavy snowfall had disrupted water distribution, damaged buildings and restricted travel.\", \"Crews were delayed in restoring power because the winds \\u2014 at times reaching hurricane-strength \\u2014 have persisted for days. Meanwhile, as families endured without electricity, the wind chill was expected to again dip as low as 35 degrees below zero on Wednesday, as it has in recent days.\", \"\\u201cThis could cause dangerous life-threatening conditions for those without power, as frostbite can develop in as little as 15 minutes in these conditions,\\u201d the National Weather Service said on Tuesday.\", \"The Matanuska Electric Association, which has been chronicling updates on Facebook, said on Monday that it had been \\u201ca very rough evening with one step forward and two steps back at every turn for our crews,\\u201d who were removing trees, fixing equipment and restoring lines, but were slowed by the conditions.\", \"\\u201cWith the wind continuing to cause damage even as they\\u2019re making repairs on existing damage, it makes it impossible to give a time frame,\\u201d the association said on Monday.\", \"By Tuesday night, more than a dozen crews remained at work trying to restore power to the remaining customers, the association said. The person writing updates on Facebook noted that it was 54 degrees in their home as they worked.\", \"A high wind warning was in place for the Matanuska Valley, which includes Palmer, Wasilla, Sutton and Chickaloon, through 6 p.m. Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. Winds were predicted to hover between 15 and 30 m.p.h., with gusts of up to 45 m.p.h. in the morning, and high temperatures expected between 5 below to 5 above, forecasters said.\", \"The American Red Cross of Alaska opened shelters in Wasilla and Palmer for residents without power, and \\u201cwill remain open as needed or until the community power is restored,\\u201d it said Tuesday on Facebook.\"]","href_hash":"1d4d04666e3311ecbe0a4354dd4a2559"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1d4d04666e3311ecbe0a4354dd4a2559"}},
