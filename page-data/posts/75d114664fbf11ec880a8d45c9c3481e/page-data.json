A mic hidden in the kitchen flowerpot captures a juicy conversation between Lennon and McCartney, who throw around the blame like parents who've lost a child.\", \"With deadlines crumbling \\u2013 ideas to stage the final performance everywhere from a Libyan amphitheatre to aboard the QE2 ocean liner seem headed for Spin\\u0308al Tap parody \\u2013 and tensions on the boil, the band relocates, at Harrison's insistence, to the more familiar surrounds of Abbey Road, where they're joined by keyboardist Billy Preston.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/fed990e009b60d09037ae2a3643f50f9\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> A Linda McCartney photo of\\u00a0The Beatles at Abbey Road in\\u00a01969.(Supplied: Linda McCartney)</div>\", \"It's here, in the series' richly rewarding middle act, that the scope of the footage pays off, revealing a band characterised less by interpersonal strife than a shared musical camaraderie \\u2013 shading in the little moments of joy that have rarely factored into the legend around the final year of the band.\", \"Lennon, in particular, flourishes, indulging in his characteristic comedic riffing \\u2013 whether he's introducing the band as \\\"The Buttles\\\" or replacing the spiritual visitation of Let It Be's lyrics with a cheeky \\\"Bloody Mary comes to me\\\".\", \"His energy bounces off McCartney's as the old songwriting pals trade vocals and quips, experiment with riffs and finish off each other's improvised lyrics \\u2013 a dynamic that, however frayed it may have become, still sends off sparks of magic in the studio.\", \"It's a compelling look at the way the band created their songs, the speed at which they worked under pressure, and how they were in constant dialogue with both their own catalogue (playfully tooling with Love Me Do and Help) and the rock 'n' roll they loved (firing off covers of Chuck Berry and The Everly Brothers among several amusing Elvis impersonations).\", \"In one of the series' most thrilling scenes, McCartney reads from a scurrilous tabloid story about the band like he's performing beat poetry at the West Village, while Lennon thrashes his way through an old rock standard \\u2013 an electrifying moment of a band united against a common enemy.\", \"Elsewhere, there's wonder in seeing now-canonical rock songs enter the world via random noodling or stream of conscious babble \\u2013 like McCartney casually strumming his way into the riff for Get Back, the melody seeming to form around him like an aura, or Harrison conjuring up the gorgeous I Me Mine after a dizzy daydream about a science fiction show.\", \"While the sheer volume of footage might be exhausting for casual viewers, Jackson and his team have generally made smart creative choices, steering clear of unnecessary editorialising and commentary and allowing the scenes to play out as they were captured.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3e3f357e35ee25725eb73364864b4630\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> \\u201cI don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s a single sort of three-week period in The Beatles\\u2019 history that\\u2019s more prolific and creative than this,\\u201d says Jackson in the press notes (the band pictured here in 1964).(Supplied: AP/Bob Dear)</div>\", \"Next to the radical way Jean-Luc Godard framed The Rolling Stones in Sympathy for the Devil (1968) \\u2013 a film also shot by Get Back's original cinematographer, Tony Richmond \\u2013 this footage becomes almost insular in its lack of wider context.\", \"What it does offer is a vivid portrait of a band responding creatively and organically in real time.\", \"The fact that The Beatles rallied themselves to create all of this in the space of a couple of weeks is a reminder of how prolific they were.
