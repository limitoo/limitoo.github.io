The addition of an estimated 10,000 returning wh\\u0101nau members and tourists, would place enormous pressure on an already exhausted health workforce,\\\" Stoltz said in the release.\", \"It is estimated the Tair\\u0101whiti population grows by 25-30 percent during the Christmas-New Year holiday period.\", \"Due to calls from the local community, the Gisborne District Council recently announced that all camping would be restricted to those with vaccination passes.\", \"Te Runanganui o Ngati Porou chairman and co-chair of Rau Tip Rau Ora, Selwyn Parata, said townships such as Ruatorea and Uawa, and some suburbs in Gisborne still had high unvaccinated populations, along with high numbers of pakeke (elders), those under 20 and wh\\u0101nau with respiratory conditions.\", \"He said these conditions were underscored by the tyranny of distance, and health services and systems that were neglected and under-resourced for years.\", \"\\\"We're aware that police checkpoints in partnership with local iwi and hap\\u016b will be established in Northland from December 15 when the borders around T\\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) are lifted,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We're asking the same consideration be given to Tair\\u0101whiti. We do not see this as setting a precedent for other parts of the country, because our circumstances in Tair\\u0101whiti are unique and like Northland they require a bespoke response\\\".\", \"Gisborne Tair\\u0101whiti Chamber of Commerce president Belinda Mackey told Midday Report she was supportive of the checkpoints if they were police-led, but had concerns.\", \"\\\"Our key concern is that we have perishable goods going in and out of the region. We produce a lot of the horticultural crops for New Zealand, and we're just concerned that there may be delays.\\\"\", \"A Ministry of Health spokesperson said the Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield received the letter on Thursday, 9 November.\", \"\\\"The Director-General of Health will be responding directly to Leadership Group on this matter,\\\" the spokesperson said.\", \"The Rau Tipu Rau Ora governance group in Tair\\u0101whiti was established to oversee the production and implementation of the Tair\\u0101whiti Covid-19 Response and Recovery Plan,\", \"The group comprises the Gisborne Mayor and the chairs of, local iwi, the Tair\\u0101whiti DHB, Trust Tair\\u0101whiti, Eastland Group Ltd and the Eastern Institute of Technology- Tair\\u0101whiti.\"]","href_hash":"64f85a285c9e11ec8e36893df5d3d070"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"64f85a285c9e11ec8e36893df5d3d070"}},
