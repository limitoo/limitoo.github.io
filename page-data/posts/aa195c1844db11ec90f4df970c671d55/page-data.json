Hochul expands access to shots beyond local offices and schools.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-13T23:45:30.000Z","content":"[\"New York State will open 10 of its Covid-19 mass vaccination sites to children ages 5 to 11 who became newly eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as it seeks to expand access beyond a network of doctors\\u2019 offices, local health departments, health centers and pharmacies.\", \"Gov. Kathy Hochul said Saturday that she had instructed the mass vaccination sites to acquire pediatric doses and prepare to administer them at those locations, adding the state aims to eventually offer the shots at all 13 of its vaccination sites in the days ahead.\", \"\\u201cSince this 5- to 11-year-old age group became eligible, we have been encouraging parents to reach out to their pediatricians and local health providers to set up vaccine appointments, and now I\\u2019m directing our state mass vaccination sites to open their doors to the youngest and most recently eligible New Yorkers,\\u201d Governor Hochul said in a statement.\", \"The selected sites include locations in three New York City boroughs as well as Yonkers, Glen Head and Stony Brook on Long Island, and the upstate cities of Albany, Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse. The state encouraged parents and guardians to check its website for availability and to schedule appointments. Only the Stony Brook location was listing appointments for children in that age group on Saturday afternoon.\", \"New York City set up clinics to bolster vaccinations in that age group in more than 200 schools on Monday, and met high demand in some neighborhoods, as part of a weeklong effort to bring a half-day vaccine clinic to each of its more than 1,000 schools. The federal government has been instructing parents and guardians to check with their health care providers and local pharmacies to get children vaccinated. Local health departments may also offer more information on specific sites.\", \"The Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on children ages 5 to 11 on Oct. 29, opening the pool of eligibility to about 28 million children. Those children are to receive one-third of the dose given to adults in two injections, given three weeks apart. The agency said that clinical trial data showed the shot was safe and prompted strong immune responses in children.\", \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on its website, encourages eligible children to be vaccinated as soon as they can get the shots, saying the benefits in protecting them from potential illness and hospitalization outweigh known and potential risks. The agency says the Covid vaccines \\u201care being monitored for safety with the most comprehensive and intense safety monitoring program in U.S. history.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"aa195c1844db11ec90f4df970c671d55"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"aa195c1844db11ec90f4df970c671d55"}},
