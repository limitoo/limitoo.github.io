Today, I want to dig a bit deeper into that issue by examining how voters and politicians have responded to the fight over education.\", \"I also want to experiment a bit with form in this space. To date, this newsletter has mostly been delivered, more or less, as a standard article. This works, I believe, for a majority of the topics I\\u2019ve covered, but sometimes I just want to update you on some of the stuff I\\u2019ve been writing about.\", \"A rightward shift for immigrant neighborhoods in New York City\", \"In November of last year, I wrote a piece titled \\u201c\\u2018People of Color\\u2019 Do Not Belong to the Democratic Party.\\u201d The argument I made was quite simple: The 2020 election had seen both Latino and Asian American populations swing toward the Republican Party. To some liberals, this might have seemed counterintuitive given Donald Trump\\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric. What I argued then, and I continue to think today, is that anyone who actually spends any amount of time in these ethnic enclaves or bothers to talk to immigrant parents could have seen this coming. A strategy of broad but, ultimately, shallow antiracism talk by the Biden campaign wasn\\u2019t going to attract voters who either care much less about racial issues than many might assume or may even see its egalitarianism as anathema to both their American dream and the pathways to success for their children.\", \"After last year's election, I talked to Taeku Lee, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Berkeley, for a podcast I co-host with two of my friends. Lee has worked in the past for AAPI DATA, an organization that collects and analyzes voting patterns in the Asian American community. There are great disparities among so-called Asian American voters, which certainly makes sense given their wide range of countries of origin, class status and geographic location. But one thing they have in common, Lee said, was that they generally have been ignored by both parties in terms of outreach.\", \"There\\u2019s some evidence now that this is changing. This month\\u2019s New York City mayoral election was basically a formality \\u2014 there was no world in which the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, would ever beat the Democrat Eric Adams. But there was one bit of surprising information that came out of the polls. Sliwa, who got 29 percent of the citywide vote, did better in Asian enclaves. As reported in The City, \\u201cSliwa scored 44 percent of the vote in precincts where more than half of the residents are Asian \\u2014 surpassing his 40 percent of votes in white enclaves, 20 percent in majority-Hispanic districts and 6 percent in majority-Black districts.\\u201d\", \"Sliwa had a real presence in Asian immigrant neighborhoods in the city, where signs in Chinese and English backing his campaign were posted. One in particular mentioned Sliwa\\u2019s support for \\u201cmerit-based SHSAT,\\u201d the test that determines entry into the city\\u2019s elite, specialized high schools, his plan to expand gifted and talented programs, and his standing behind the Police Department and \\u201cLaw and Order.\\u201d Some signs also called for voters to reject Democrats because they \\u201clabel looting, burning, murder as peaceful protests,\\u201d want to \\u201cabolish merit-based SHSAT\\u201d and encourage \\u201claziness.\\u201d\", \"Data on why, exactly, immigrant populations vote one way or the other is unreliable, but the sense I\\u2019ve gotten from my years of covering this question is that the most important issues in these communities are affirmative action, anti-Asian attacks and so-called merit-based educational issues like admissions tests for top schools. Sliwa, for his part, had a plank of his platform dedicated to \\u201cProtecting Asian Community,\\u201d where he talked about how his Guardian Angel group had been patrolling \\u201careas that have large Chinese populations.\\u201d\", \"The Republican strategy to court Asian voters extended beyond New York City. After their victory in Virginia, governor-elect Glenn Youngkin\\u2019s staff did a victory lap in the media. In an interview with Ryan Lizza in Politico, Jeff Roe, a strategist, said, \\u201cOne of our first advertising pieces in the general election \\u2014 and one of the first things we hammered on \\u2014 was that the Thomas Jefferson School in Northern Virginia had lowered their academic standards.\\u201d\", \"Thomas Jefferson, or TJ as its called by alumni, is a magnet school with a predominantly Asian student population and an admissions test that was recently replaced with a more holistic model of student assessment. The fight has been prolonged and bitter, and it\\u2019s still unclear whether Youngkin\\u2019s inroads into the Washington suburbs were spurred on by frustrated Asian American parents. Regardless, it\\u2019s notable that Republican political operatives, and not Democrats, are talking empathetically and specifically about the concerns of Asian Americans.\", \"In the interview, Roe also said:\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re an Asian American family going to Thomas Jefferson School and they lower the standards to let more kids who aren\\u2019t in accelerated math into the best school in the country, that\\u2019s pretty important to you. Advanced math is a big dang thing. But it also is to the Republicans: Why would you not help and want your children to succeed and achieve?\\u201d\", \"This is the type of direct messaging that should work for a lot of Asian American voters. Forget about making some unified, antiracist edict that you hope will capture the entirety of a population made up of people who may not think of themselves as a \\u201cpeople\\u201d at all. Instead, focus on the things a specific population of Asian voters actually do care about and try to sound empathetic when you talk about them, even when you disagree. It\\u2019s not that complicated.\", \"So, what\\u2019s the future of the Asian American vote?\", \"Prior to the \\u201990s, Asian Americans were generally thought of as a reliable Republican voting bloc who supported Ronald Reagan-style economic policies. There was a lot of truth to this, but it also was belied by the fact that political participation was low in many Asian American communities. A more accurate statement would be: Asian Americans used to vote Republican, but a majority did not vote at all. Bill Clinton\\u2019s second presidential campaign was seen as the start of a shift toward the left, one that became more pronounced during the 2008 election, when Barack Obama captured an estimated 62 percent of the Asian American vote.\", \"There are a lot of theories about why this happened, but most people agree that it has been because of some mix of outreach and a generational shift from immigrant parents, whose politics are shaped by their homelands, to their children, who are acculturated in the United States.\", \"I want to focus here on the generational question because it stands to reason that if young Asian American voters are reliably liberal, then the Democrats will keep or possibly even expand their gains over the past 30 years. The idea is that bumps in the road like this year\\u2019s New York City mayoral election should be contextualized within a long-term trend toward the Democratic Party.\", \"It still feels too early to tell what might happen 20 or even 10 years down the line with Asian American voters. A study released this summer by Tufts University found a surge of political participation among Asian American youth, many of whom did cite \\u201cracism\\u201d as one of their top priorities. But they still did not vote at the same rate (47 percent) as white youth (61 percent) and still cite a lack of outreach by political campaigns, which means that a lot of votes are still up for grabs.\", \"More important, generational divides are not static or fixed in time. The children of immigrants who came to the United States in the \\u201970s and \\u201980s may very well now be voting Democratic, but nearly 60 percent of people of Asian descent in America are foreign-born. The politics of recent immigrants, especially those who live in enclaves like the ones who turned out for Sliwa, are still in flux, and there\\u2019s no guarantee that their children will follow the same pattern as earlier, second-generation Asian Americans.\", \"This means that Democrats shouldn\\u2019t simply sit back and wait for the first generation to die out. There are new first generations arriving every day.\", \"Why can\\u2019t Democrats speak to voter frustration?\", \"The most compelling analysis I read about education and the Virginia governor\\u2019s race came from Maya Wiley in The New Republic. Wiley, a progressive civil rights attorney who ran unsuccessfully for mayor of New York City, argued that Youngkin was using the C.R.T. panic to shore up white support and spread racial resentment. This, she wrote, was a new version of the \\u201cSouthern strategy,\\u201d the 1950s and \\u201960s movement to solidify Republican voting strongholds by inciting anti-Blackness in Southern states.\", \"But Wiley also saw a personal touch in Youngkin\\u2019s outreach to parents. Describing his final campaign speech, she wrote:\", \"\\u201cHe sounded like a moderate Democrat, with the notable exception of C.R.T. His very first promise is to end the closure of schools due to Covid-19. Well, with schools fully reopened and the now-approved vaccine for school-age children, that is a promise without a problem behind it. It\\u2019s also irrelevant. The facts often are. In that opening salvo, he was connecting with the pain and frustration of parents, particularly all those white women without college degrees who voted for Biden last year and shifted massively to Youngkin on Tuesday. He was saying he understood their pain and would not repeat it.\", \"\\u201cPeople cheered. He went on to promise more money for students needing special education and more advanced math and advanced degrees. As a progressive, I agree! Shocking, right? This was not just the substance of his message. It was the order of his message. He was saying, \\u201cI feel you. I got you. And I will be concrete, specific, and clear.\\u201d\", \"Wiley also noted Terry McAuliffe\\u2019s poor performance. He \\u201cfailed to talk about people\\u2019s lives\\u201d and spent his final speech railing against \\u201cTrump and racism.\\u201d She criticized McAuliffe for being far too \\u201cwonky\\u201d and gave an example in which McAuliffe says he will spend money to expand access to pre-K programs but does not directly talk to mothers about how they have gone through a hellish two years of balancing work and full-time child care.\", \"Wiley is right: Candidates need to connect with the anger of people who have been left behind during the pandemic. They need to understand that almost everyone, whether it\\u2019s suburban mothers who have left the workplace and feel abandoned by their children\\u2019s schools or essential workers who took care of the elderly and indigent in nursing homes with no meaningful support. They feel a great deal of frustration about the pandemic. They will not be reassured by a list of policy proposals and stale anti-Trump messaging.\"]","href_hash":"2bce6a76465011ec92cfe799449da590"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2bce6a76465011ec92cfe799449da590"}},
