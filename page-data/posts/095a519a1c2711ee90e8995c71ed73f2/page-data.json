While the 11 voting members of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee ultimately agreed to pause any bumps during their June 13-June 14 meeting, it's unlikely that they will keep rates untouched again when they meet again later this month. In fact, signs are strong that they will raise rates at least twice more in 2023, likely starting in July.\", \"While higher interest rates make borrowing with everything from mortgages to credit cards more expensive, there is a silver lining: The returns savers can obtain with their savings and certificates of deposit (CD) accounts.
