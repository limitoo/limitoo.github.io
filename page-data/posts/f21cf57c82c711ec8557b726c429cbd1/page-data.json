The F.T.C. also said that, in another violation of its rules, many online reviews of Hubble had been written by people who had been compensated, including in at least one instance one of its own executives.\", \"The settlement comes after an investigation by The New York Times in 2019 detailed criticism of Hubble by optometrists and ophthalmologists. They said that the brand\\u2019s direct-to-consumer model bypassed eye care professionals, that it did not properly vet prescriptions and that it took advantage of federal regulations to sell customers its own brand of contact lenses. Industry professionals told The Times that Hubble switched people out of their prescribed lens brands and into Hubble\\u2019s lenses, which could be harmful to customers.\", \"Vision Path and Hubble sought to disrupt the contact lens industry by offering a line of low-cost daily lenses via monthly $39 subscriptions. The company, which raised more than $70 million in funding from venture firms and companies like Colgate-Palmolive, marketed itself heavily through social media and sought to mimic the success of other direct-to-consumer companies like Harry\\u2019s and Dollar Shave Club.\", \"But contact lenses are typically fitted, prescribed and sold by optometrists, who often specify brands from major manufacturers like Acuvue Oasys or Biofinity Toric in prescriptions. Before selling lenses, companies must obtain a copy of a consumer\\u2019s prescription or verify their information with a prescriber.\", \"The F.T.C. said that until it began investigation, Hubble failed to ask consumers for copies of their contact lens prescriptions and typically would not allow customers to provide their prescriptions on its website. This, according to the F.T.C., \\u201censured that Hubble could not receive customers\\u2019 prescriptions and thus could act as though it was unaware that these consumers had prescriptions for non-Hubble lenses.\\u201d The company sometimes failed to make required attempts to verify customer-provided prescription information or made it difficult or impossible for prescribers to verify prescriptions, according to the F.T.C.\", \"\\u201cHubble\\u2019s business model boosted its bottom line but created needless risk for its customers\\u2019 eye health,\\u201d Samuel Levine, the director of the F.T.C.\\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in the release.\", \"Vision Path said in a statement on Friday that it disagreed with many of the F.T.C.\\u2019s claims but believed a settlement was the best way for Hubble to move forward.\", \"\\u201cThe F.T.C\\u2019s allegations relate to a period when the company was just starting up, and all requirements in the order were addressed long ago through improvements to our systems and internal processes,\\u201d said Steven Druckman, the chief executive of Vision Path.\"]","href_hash":"f21cf57c82c711ec8557b726c429cbd1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f21cf57c82c711ec8557b726c429cbd1"}},
