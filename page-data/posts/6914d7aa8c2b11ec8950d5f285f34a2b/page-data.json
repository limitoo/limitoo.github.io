Moscow is also capable of sending troops over Ukraine's eastern border.\\u00a0\", \"U.S. officials have said Russia already has intelligence operatives on the ground that could create a pretext for an invasion by assisting in creating a false flag. Last month, U.S. officials said this could involve Russian operatives \\\"trained in urban warfare and in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia's own proxy forces.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Weather conditions that freeze the ground would allow heavy Russian military equipment including tanks to advance more easily. But ground troops are not the only option that Russian President Vladimir Putin could use.\", \"U.S. officials do not have evidence that Putin has decided to deploy these assets to launch an invasion but emphasize that he is now capable of making the decision to execute with very little warning. On Friday, Politico was the first to report that the U.S. had intelligence indicating that Russian military leaders had been told to be ready by February 16.\", \"The cumulative picture of Moscow's planning triggered the U.S. on Saturday to pull out U.S. military advisers, withdraw some embassy staff from Kyiv and move staff to a makeshift consular post in Lviv, a city in western Ukraine. Sullivan said Friday that \\\"prudence demands\\\" planning \\u2014 even though the U.S. does not know exactly what is going to happen.\\u00a0\", \"Privately, U.S. and Western officials say it is entirely possible that this could be an incredibly dangerous and expensive bluff on Putin's part, but they argue that it is the responsibility of their leaders to weigh the risk.\", \"Three Western officials from allied governments expressed skepticism that Putin would take action as extreme as putting 100,000 soldiers on the march and risk a state-on-state conflict, or be willing to take on the occupation of a country that has resisted Russian aggression for the past eight years. Yet all three acknowledged that intelligence indicates the Russian military is definitely planning for that option.\", \"Camilla Schick contributed reporting.\", \"Margaret Brennan is moderator of CBS News' \\\"Face The Nation\\\" and CBS News' senior foreign affairs correspondent based in Washington, D.C.\"]","href_hash":"6914d7aa8c2b11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6914d7aa8c2b11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
