He was one of 55 finishers.\", \"On Sunday, Nov. 7, 2021, Trachtenberg, now 67, will run the marathon again, as one of 33,000 athletes lining up at the base of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge on Staten Island.\", \"He will be the lone runner who ran the inaugural New York City Marathon who is also racing this year\\u2019s event, the marathon\\u2019s 50th running.\", \"\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t go through all of this for Boston or London or whatever,\\u201d Trachtenberg said over the phone from his home in Eugene, Ore. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just that it\\u2019s New York.\\u201d\", \"In 1970, Trachtenberg was a talented cross-country athlete who saw an ad for the race in the pages of The New York Times. He took a second look. He was used to training for races that were closer to two miles, not 26.2 miles. Could he run for that long without stopping, he wondered? Could he run for that long without drinking water?\", \"He signed up. Why not? He was always looking for new ways to test his endurance, and he still has newspaper clippings from winning a physical fitness contest in 1969.\", \"\\u201cI had to be thinking outside the box to do the marathon in the first place,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not like there was anybody else in housing projects in New York City running marathons.\\u201d\", \"Two weeks before the race, he took the subway to Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx with the goal of running what he estimated to be a half-marathon. That felt easy enough, he said. He figured all he had to do was double the distance. The day before the race he decided to scope out the course and ran seven and a half miles through Central Park.\", \"\\u201cI find the training logs hilarious,\\u201d he said of his 51-year-old notes from the weeks surrounding the race. He did almost precisely what a coach would tell a marathon runner not to do before race day. \\u201cI had no idea!\\u201d\", \"But Trachtenberg wasn\\u2019t too worried. The marathon just wasn\\u2019t a big deal, he said, and he\\u2019s still unsure of who knew exactly what he was up to on that humid September morning.\", \"\\u201cMy mom must have known I was going to be doing it because I was going to be gone for a long period of time,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut she didn\\u2019t remember me doing it or anything unusual about the day. It was not all that notable.\\u201d\", \"He finished in 32nd place with a time of 3 hours 22 minutes 4 seconds \\u2014 enough to be awarded a plaque \\u2014 having not stopped for any liquid throughout the entire race. \\u201cI remember there was free soda at the finish and I could have as much as I wanted,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI remember drinking six cans of soda at the finish, that was my treat.\\u201d\", \"After one day off, Trachtenberg returned to cross-country practice. He would win a race 13 days later, and he went on to run for Princeton University.\", \"It was only 10 years ago that he realized that his participation in the 1970 marathon was something, as he put it, \\u201cworth mentioning.\\u201d\", \"A former colleague in the running mecca of Eugene was shocked to learn of his running past. \\u201cThey told me I should be treated like royalty,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t take any pictures because I didn\\u2019t think this would be anything anyone would make a big deal about 50 years in the future.\\u201d\", \"The modest Central Park race with its 127 entrants transformed into a five-borough marathon in 1976 and has since morphed into the largest marathon in the world. There have been 1,283,005 total finishers over 49 runnings, cheered on by millions of spectators and thousands of volunteers.\", \"That explosion in popularity is still a shock to Trachtenberg, who hasn\\u2019t run in Central Park since 1975, and has not raced a marathon since 1978.\", \"\\u201cThe spectacle is overwhelming \\u2014 obviously it\\u2019s going to be extremely emotional for me,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve cried like a million times.\\u201d\", \"Trachtenberg speaks of the race like a true New Yorker, with the same reverence as the race director, Ted Metellus, who was born in the Bronx.\", \"\\u201cWhen you think about an event that has been going on for 50 years, that\\u2019s 50 years of legacy, of community,\\u201d Metellus said. \\u201cAnd it\\u2019s not just the runners, it\\u2019s the volunteers, it\\u2019s the community, it\\u2019s the partners.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cEveryone has a big or small New York City Marathon story,\\u201d he added, \\u201cand this year will be the world\\u2019s biggest alumni party.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s a party that Trachtenberg couldn\\u2019t pass up.\", \"At the beginning of our conversation, he called the race a grand reunion and perhaps a grand farewell. He\\u2019s nearing his 70s, and he\\u2019s not sure he\\u2019ll be able to finish the race.\", \"He really wants to run over the Verrazzano Bridge, he said at first. Oh, but he\\u2019d like to make it to his old hangs in Queens, he added. But if he\\u2019s that far, he might as well cross the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan, right? And how cool would it be to finish in Central Park again?\", \"By the end he had changed his tune. Maybe he will do the New York City Marathon again, he said, his own excitement catching up with him. He plans on getting a heart valve replacement, and wouldn\\u2019t it be fun if he could compare his times from before and after the surgery?\", \"Spoken almost like a 16-year-old entering the inaugural New York City Marathon on a whim.\"]","href_hash":"098754223bcf11ec8d93000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"098754223bcf11ec8d93000017025a03"}},
