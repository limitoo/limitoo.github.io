Attorney General Eric Schmitt of Missouri led the group that brought the lawsuit, which was joined by private and nonprofit groups.\", \"The Biden administration on Thursday set Jan. 4 as the deadline for large companies to mandate coronavirus vaccinations or start weekly testing of their workers.\", \"The new rule, applying to companies with 100 or more employees, is expected to cover 84 million workers, roughly 31 million of whom are unvaccinated.\", \"The lawsuit on Friday was filed in U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit by Missouri and was joined by Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. The office of Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, a Democrat, also joined in the lawsuit.\", \"The lawsuit came a day after the attorneys general of Kentucky, Tennessee and Ohio sued to stop the vaccine mandate for federal contractors from going into effect. \", \"The requirement on large private businesses is the most far-reaching and politically controversial measure in the government\\u2019s efforts to fight the pandemic. Attorneys general in at least 24 states have threatened to sue. Republican governors and some industry trade groups have come out against the requirement, and the 20 percent of U.S. adults who remain unvaccinated may oppose the mandate as well.\", \"\", \"\"]","href_hash":"2a9c85183e4211ecaea6d9cfbf1abccd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2a9c85183e4211ecaea6d9cfbf1abccd"}},
