Now four points clear of its closest rival with four games remaining, Canada has put itself in pole position for one of the region\\u2019s three automatic spots in Qatar in November.\", \"And with its hardest tests behind it \\u2014 Canada went unbeaten in home and away matches against the region\\u2019s two traditional heavyweights, the United States (1-0-1) and Mexico (1-0-1) \\u2014 a generational achievement may be just around the corner: Should Canada qualify, it World Cup trip will be the first for its men\\u2019s team since 1986.\", \"The defeat, in front of a raucous crowd in Hamilton was a blow for the United States, but hardly a fatal one. The Americans remained in second place in the table, temporarily, just ahead of Mexico, which played Costa Rica later Sunday.\", \"The last \\u2014 and only previous \\u2014 time Canada played in the soccer\\u2019s showcase tournament, only one player on its current national team roster was alive: defender Atiba Hutchinson, 39. But re-energized by a talented crop of young stars, and European-based pros like Cyle Larin, who scored an early opening goal Sunday, and Sam Adekugbe, who added the late clincher, Canada has risen from years as an afterthought into a present as a power.\", \"With its victory, Canada remained the only unbeaten team in the final round of qualifying in the region, and posted its first victory over the United States in World Cup qualifying in 42 years.\", \"Canada took advantage of a sloppy start by the United States to snatch an early goal after only seven minutes, and held on the rest of the game even after the Americans began to dominate play. In front of a crowd that braved the wind chill of 18 degrees Fahrenheit at game time, Canada yielded its share possession at times but little ground, matching the Americans\\u2019 pressure with aggressive, physical and at times pugnacious responses.\", \"The opening goal came amid a series of United States mistakes. Canada won Matt Turner\\u2019s short goal kick in the air and then used a quick interchange of passes to transform a turnover into a goal. Larin, after a give and go with Jonathan David, got a step on United States center back Miles Robinson, who slipped trying to keep up, and blasted a shot past a diving Turner.\", \"As the first half wore on, the United States slowly gained more control of both the pace and the ball. But the same issue that has marked their earlier qualifying missteps returned: They failed to convert their chances.\", \"When Adekugbe split the defense on a counterattack in injury time and slotted in the second goal, the Canadians on the field, on the bench and in the stands knew victory \\u2014 and perhaps a World Cup spot \\u2014 was theirs. It may take another game, or two, but for the players, and perhaps for some of their fans, it is starting to feel like the chance of a lifetime.\"]","href_hash":"b1f1de50821c11ecaee8cd7f62d11b6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b1f1de50821c11ecaee8cd7f62d11b6f"}},
