Thanks for your post. We're really sorry to hear our Pumpkin Pie let you down this year. We'd like to get in touch with you so we can hear more and help.\\\"\", \"Commenters couldn't believe the company responded, and many of them begged Marie Callender's not to apologize for a mishap that was obviously not the company's fault.\", \"\\\"Don't you dare apologize. It's not your fault Sharon decided to get tanked and set her oven to hellfire,\\\" wrote Heather.\", \"Renee added: \\\"don't you dare! You did nothing wrong!\\\"\", \"But as it turns out, Weiss isn't the first person to burn a Marie Callender's pie. A few of the company's customers alleged in their online product reviews that they, too, had similar experiences.\", \"\\\"Baking instructions wrong,\\\" wrote a one-star reviewer named Boboknows. \\\"I baked this exactly as the instructions on the box. The top came out burnt. Overall the pie flavor wasn't the best, even if you peeled the burnt layer off.\\\"\", \"\\\"I baked this pie the pie ended up burned when I took it out of the oven I don't know how it got burned I followed the instructions on the box says to bake it for 70-80 minutes. I only baked it for 73 minutes and it got burned. They need to change the baking instructions on the box very disappointed with this pie,\\\" said Gregory in his review.\", \"Jackie27 said: \\\"I followed directions and pie crust is black and also the top of the pie. I could not cook it any longer.\\\"\", \"Still, Facebook users could not stop poking fun at the fact that Weiss not only burned the dessert but that she also had the courage to blame the company for it.\", \"\\\"Ma'am where in the recipe [does it say] you gotta bake it in the actual SUN?\\\" asked Karla.\", \"\\\"I'm no culinary genius or anything, but I'm pretty sure the instructions say to bake those pies, not light them on fire and then stick them in the broiler,\\\" wrote Alex.\", \"\\\"Did you try to bake the pie and self-clean the oven at the same time?\\\" asked Melvin.\", \"\\\"Marie didn't tell you to burn it, Sharon,\\\" replied Lauren.\", \"Sarah asked: \\\"You do know the fire alarm isn't a timer right?\\\"\", \"\\\"I get it, Sharon. I didn't put enough coffee grounds in the coffee maker this morning, and the coffee came out weak. Thanks, Marie Callender's!\\\" exclaimed Travis.\", \"Abi joked: \\\"Thanks to Marie Callender, my wife left, took the kids, the house and even the dog and all I have left is the credit card debt she put us in.\\\"\", \"\\\"Sharon, the smoke alarm wasn't cheering you on.
