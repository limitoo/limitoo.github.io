For the Democrat: Trump redux.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-01T19:42:03.000Z","content":"[\"In the final hours of campaigning on Monday to become Virginia\\u2019s next governor, it was Glenn Youngkin offering an optimistic vision for the future while Terry McAuliffe delivered harsh warnings about ghosts of the past.\", \"As the two men barnstormed across the state, the contrast in tone demonstrated their shifting fortunes in the highest profile race on the ballot on Tuesday. Mr. McAuliffe, a longtime fixture of the Democratic establishment, was scrambling to prevent President Biden\\u2019s unpopularity, the gridlock in Washington and Mr. Youngkin\\u2019s effective weaponizing of racial issues in the public schools from dooming his bid for a second term as governor.\", \"Mr. Youngkin, for his part, was aiming to redefine how Republicans could win elections with former President Donald J. Trump out of the White House. He has accepted Mr. Trump\\u2019s support and has abstained from criticizing him, but Mr. Youngkin has kept Mr. Trump from visiting Virginia and never invokes his name during his stump speeches. A former private equity executive, Mr. Youngkin embraced Mr. Trump during the primary contest this year but spent the months since winning the Republican nomination keeping a rhetorical distance.\", \"On Monday, in the Richmond area, Mr. Youngkin said he would lead a sweep of Republican victories across the state that would define a new era for the party \\u2014 one that he has centered on giving parents greater control over the curriculum in public schools, particularly in how children are educated about racism.\", \"\\u201cWe will not teach our children to view everything through the lens of race,\\u201d Mr. Youngkin told supporters at a midday rally in an airplane hangar. \\u201cSo on Day 1, I will ban critical race theory from Virginia\\u2019s schools.\\u201d\", \"That theory, a graduate-level academic framework that argues that historical patterns of racism are ingrained in law and other modern institutions, is not taught in Virginia\\u2019s public schools. But conservatives have turned it into a flash point in key suburban areas such as Loudoun County, just outside Washington.\", \"Earlier, in Roanoke, the biggest city in the mountain-specked southwest corner of the state, and a Republican stronghold, Mr. Youngkin promised voters that the party\\u2019s renewal was at hand.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re going to have a whole new crop of Republicans come in and define a new way forward,\\u201d he told supporters in a morning rally at the airport.\", \"While Mr. Youngkin never mentioned Mr. Trump in his 22-minute speech, he touched on several of the former president\\u2019s themes and deployed some of his catchphrases.\", \"\\u201cI am so tired of Virginia losing,\\u201d Mr. Youngkin said. \\u201cI want Virginia to start winning again.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Trump, who arranged to speak to his own Virginia supporters on Mr. Youngkin\\u2019s behalf during a Monday evening conference call \\u201ctele-rally,\\u201d appeared to be angling to take credit if Mr. Youngkin was victorious.\", \"The media, Mr. Trump said in a statement earlier in the day, was \\u201ctrying to create an impression that Glenn Youngkin and I are at odds and don\\u2019t like each other.\\u201d He said that this was untrue: \\u201cWe get along very well together and strongly believe in many of the same policies.\\u201d\", \"Still, Mr. Youngkin let it be known that he was too busy campaigning to attend the Trump call-in.\", \"Mr. McAuliffe, crisscrossing the state in another plane, hammered away at the Trump-Youngkin connection, as he has for weeks. He warned that a victory by Mr. Youngkin would pave the way for Mr. Trump to attempt his own political restoration, and urged Virginians not to let the two of them exploit the state that way.\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t want a Trump wannabe, someone who has been endorsed by Donald Trump 10 times,\\u201d Mr. McAuliffe told reporters after a morning stop in Roanoke. \\u201cDonald Trump wants to win tomorrow so that on the next day he will declare for president of the United States. He wants to use Virginia as the launchpad for his presidential.\\u201d\", \"Mr. McAuliffe\\u2019s strategy of tethering Mr. Youngkin to Mr. Trump has not stopped his lead in the polls from evaporating. A Washington Post poll released over the weekend revealed the Virginia race to be in a dead heat, a stark comedown for a Democratic Party that has not lost a statewide race in Virginia since 2009. Mr. Biden won the state by 10 percentage points last year.\", \"Officials on both sides of the race for governor are stymied by a lack of information about what Tuesday\\u2019s electorate will look like. It is the first statewide contest under voting rules established in 2020, which created 45 days of no-excuse early voting across the state.\", \"More than 1.1 million votes have already been cast, according to data from the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project, down from the 2.8 million people who voted leading up to Election Day in 2020 but up sharply from the 195,000 early votes in the 2017 election for governor.\", \"Tom Bonier, the chief executive of TargetSmart, a Democratic data firm, wrote on Sunday that Black turnout in the early vote was down slightly from 2020 levels, while the percentage of young voters was \\u201clagging badly behind previous benchmarks.\\u201d\", \"The share of rural voters casting ballots early was up sharply, and Republican voters appeared far more enthusiastic about the election than Democrats did, he said.\", \"That could ratchet up the drama surrounding who shows up at the polls on Tuesday. \\u201cElection Day will be decisive,\\u201d Mr. Bonier said.\", \"On the ground, officials working on voter turnout for the Democratic ticket said they were finding Black voters far less engaged in this year\\u2019s election than in contests during Mr. Trump\\u2019s presidency, when the president\\u2019s constant Twitter commentary provided a steady supply of outrage.\", \"\\u201cBecause Trump is not in office, there\\u2019s no longer a constant barrage of foolery for them to pay attention to,\\u201d said Angela Angel, a senior adviser for Black Lives Matter PAC, who was canvassing Black neighborhoods in Virginia Beach on Monday. \\u201cGood or bad, it drew them into politics.\\u201d\", \"Mr. McAuliffe has sought to engage Black voters in the campaign through a series of high-profile Black surrogates. He reminded reporters on Monday that he had appeared at rallies with former President Barack Obama, Vice President Kamala Harris and Stacey Abrams, the voting rights activist and former Democratic legislator from Georgia.\", \"But Ms. Angel said voters were expressing \\u201csome disappointment about the current administration\\u201d for failing to enact many of the major changes that Mr. Biden had promised last year as he sought to oust Mr. Trump from office.\", \"Even Mr. McAuliffe lamented the slow pace at which congressional Democrats had been negotiating their long-awaited legislation on infrastructure and social policy.\", \"\\u201cI hope that tomorrow they\\u2019re going to pass an infrastructure bill,\\u201d Mr. McAuliffe said in Roanoke on Monday morning. \\u201cGet your job done. Pass the bill. It\\u2019s not going to have any relevance to our election, but it will have relevance when I\\u2019m governor.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ada3bfca3b4b11ecbb12000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ada3bfca3b4b11ecbb12000017025a03"}},
