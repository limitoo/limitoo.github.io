Last year, the agency also distributed more than $140 million of additional grants supported by funding from the American Rescue Plan Act.\", \"Some of the new awards are dedicated to infrastructure. One grant, of $500,000, is going to the Esperanza Peace and Justice Institute in San Antonio to support the refurbishment of seven historic buildings to be used as a cultural center focused on the immigrant communities of the city\\u2019s Westside neighborhood.
