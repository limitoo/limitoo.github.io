She was 96.\", \"The death was confirmed by her husband, Marc Rosen.\", \"Strikingly beautiful, Ms. Dahl was a model before becoming an actress \\u2014 \\u201cconsidered one of the world\\u2019s loveliest gals,\\u201d The Daily News of New York wrote in a profile in 1959, using the parlance of the day.\", \"With her fiery red hair, she was a natural for Technicolor; she notably played the seductive sister of another famous redhead, Rhonda Fleming, in the 1956 crime drama \\u201cSlightly Scarlet.\\u201d But though she demonstrated her range in everything from westerns, like \\u201cThe Outriders\\u201d (1950), to the Red Skelton comedies \\u201cA Southern Yankee\\u201d (1948) and \\u201cWatch the Birdie\\u201d (1950), critics tended to focus on her looks more than her acting.\", \"\\u201cArlene Dahl is displayed to wondrous advantage,\\u201d declared one review of the 1953 adventure \\u201cDiamond Queen.\\u201d\", \"The industry did the same.\", \"\\u201cArlene Dahl was another classic case \\u2014 like Jane Greer and Evelyn Keyes \\u2014 of a smart, fiercely funny woman being pigeonholed by her beauty,\\u201d Eddie Muller, who organizes an annual film noir festival in San Francisco, said in an interview in 2009, when Ms. Dahl was the event\\u2019s guest of honor. \\u201cIt was hard for her to break out of the \\u2018redheaded bombshell\\u2019 mold.\", \"\\u201cThe great thing about Arlene,\\u201d he continued, \\u201cis that she didn\\u2019t let it bother her.

McCormick, the publisher of The Tribune, who, she said, \\u201chad an idea that if a girl like me would tell women how to be beautiful, they\\u2019d believe it.\\u201d\", \"She soon founded a cosmetics and lingerie company, Arlene Dahl Enterprises, and would later write a syndicated astrology column as well as numerous books on both astrology and beauty.\", \"These ventures kept her in the public eye long after she had left Hollywood and settled on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. And though acting was no longer her focus after the early 1960s, she was seen into the 1990s on television shows like \\u201cThe Love Boat,\\u201d \\u201cFantasy Island\\u201d and \\u201cRenegade.\\u201d \", \"She also appeared on Broadway in 1972, when she took over the lead role in \\u201cApplause,\\u201d the hit musical based on the 1950 movie \\u201cAll About Eve.\\u201d\", \"Arlene Carol Dahl was born on Aug. 11, 1925, in Minneapolis. Her father, Rudolph Dahl, was a car dealer. Her mother, Idelle (Swan) Dahl, died when Arlene was a teenager. With her father\\u2019s blessing, she then moved to Chicago, where she modeled for the Marshall Field\\u2019s department store, before relocating again, this time to New York City, where she continued to work as a model while pursuing acting.\", \"In 1945, she landed a small part in a short-lived Broadway musical, \\u201cMr. Strauss Goes to Boston.\\u201d The next year, while appearing in Philadelphia in \\u201cQuestionable Ladies,\\u201d a play that would close before making it to Broadway, she was spotted by the movie mogul Jack Warner, who invited her to Hollywood for a screen test. \", \"Ms. Dahl began her movie career with Warner Bros., but soon moved to MGM, the leading studio of the day, where she first attracted notice with supporting roles in movies like \\u201cThe Bride Goes Wild\\u201d (1948) and \\u201cScene of the Crime\\u201d (1949). She became a regular presence in the Hollywood gossip columns as well; after dating, among many other men, the young John F. Kennedy, she had two well-publicized marriages to fellow actors.\", \"She and Lex Barker, who played Tarzan in the late 1940s and early \\u201950s \\u2014 and who, she told People magazine, was the \\u201cmost handsome man I\\u2019d ever seen\\u201d \\u2014 divorced in 1952 after a year and a half of marriage. Two years later, she married the Argentine actor Fernando Lamas.\", \"That marriage was tempestuous. The two had many public spats and several reconciliations meant to preserve the union \\u2014 for the sake, Ms. Dahl said at the time, of their son, Lorenzo Lamas, who would go on to have a successful acting career of his own \\u2014 but they ended in failure.\", \"Ms. Dahl and Mr. Lamas divorced in 1960. She would marry four more times. She married Mr. Rosen, a perfume bottle designer, in 1984. In addition to him, she is survived by Lorenzo Lamas; a daughter, Carole Delouvrier, from her third marriage, to Chris Holmes; another son, Stephen Schaum, from her fifth marriage, to Rounsville Schaum; nine grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\", \"Many of Ms. Dahl\\u2019s ideas about beauty seem quaint at best today, but they were the key to her initial success as a writer. \\u201cWomen are fast losing femininity, their proudest possession,\\u201d she said in a 1963 interview, \\u201cand I think it is important to tell them what men think so they will not lose what is most desired.\\u201d\", \"She had comparable success later when she started writing about astrology.\", \"While she was passionate about the subject \\u2014 one interviewer wrote that she wanted to know his sign before she would agree to sit down with him \\u2014 Ms. Dahl stopped short of claiming that astrology could predict the future.\", \"\\u201cI liken astrology to a weatherman who forecasts the weather,\\u201d she said in a 2001 CNN interview. \\u201cIf the weatherman says it\\u2019s going to rain tomorrow, you get up in the morning and you look out, and you see that it\\u2019s cloudy and it\\u2019s likely to rain, so you take an umbrella if you don\\u2019t want to get wet.
