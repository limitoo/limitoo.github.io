Though it will slow those purchases, the Fed\\u2019s main policy interest rate \\u2014 which affects borrowing costs across the economy \\u2014 remains set at near-zero.\", \"Officials have signaled that they will use their policy rate, which is the more powerful of the Fed\\u2019s tools,\\u00a0to help the recovery along until the labor market is more fully healed. But that plan could be upended by rapidly rising prices. The Fed is tasked with achieving full employment and keeping price gains low and stable, and if inflation does not fade next year as policymakers expect, they might decide to lift interest rates to slow down demand and keep inflation in check.\", \"Prices picked up by 4.4 percent in the year through September, well above the Fed\\u2019s 2 percent goal. The price gains have been decelerating in recent months after popping this summer, but it is possible that rising rents, climbing labor costs and continued supply chain disruptions could keep them elevated in the months ahead.\", \"In their November policy statement, officials noted the rapid pace of price increases, but predicted that they will fade.\", \"\\u201cInflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory,\\u201d they said. \\u201cSupply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors.\\u201d\", \"Fed officials are willing to tolerate a temporary bout of inflation as the economy reopens from the pandemic, but if consumers and businesses come to expect persistently higher prices, that could spell trouble. High and erratic inflation that persists would make it hard for businesses to plan and might eat away at wage increases for workers who lack bargaining power.\", \"Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has signaled that he and his colleagues would react if they believed that rapid price gains were going to be sustained.\", \"Slowing bond purchases now will leave them more nimble going forward. Many officials would not want to lift interest rates while they are still making large bond purchases, because doing so would mean that their two tools are working against one another. Finishing the buying program sooner will leave central bankers in a position to lift borrowing costs if a rate increase is deemed necessary.\", \"Fed officials have tried to separate the path to slow bond buying, commonly called \\u201ctapering,\\u201d from their plans for interest rates. Even so, investors increasingly expect rate increases to start midway through 2022, market pricing suggests.\", \"But there are potential costs to lifting borrowing costs early or aggressively. Many workers have yet to return to the job market after employment plummeted amid pandemic lockdowns. Some employees may have retired, but many people who are now on the labor market\\u2019s sidelines may trickle back to the job search as child-care issues are resolved and health concerns wane.\", \"If the Fed slows the economy before they do that, it could be harder for them to move into new jobs, leaving the economy with less potential and families with fewer paychecks.\", \"This is a developing story.
