Also, fine china. In fiction, we recommend new novels by Karl Ove Knausgaard and Claire Vaye Watkins, along with Gary Shteyngart\\u2019s pandemic-inspired narrative of friends and rivals locked down for the duration on a secluded country estate.\", \"Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowles\", \"THE CHANCELLOR: The Remarkable Odyssey of Angela Merkel, by Kati Marton. (Simon & Schuster, $30.) German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is stepping down this year after four terms, is famous for her plain but direct style. She is famously private, so it\\u2019s no simple task to write her biography. But Marton has doggedly retraced Merkel\\u2019s trail, and the story she tells is a good one. Our critic Dwight Garner writes that this book \\u201cis a bit like Merkel herself: calm, dispassionate, not afraid to bore us. Many readers will find it a balm. It\\u2019s instructive to spend time in Merkel\\u2019s competent and humane company.\\u201d\", \"THE SHATTERING: America in the 1960s, by Kevin Boyle. (Norton, $32.) This rich, layered account of the 1960s complicates our ideas of the well-covered decade. Cold War policy, with the increasing centrality of the Vietnam War, is one of the strands in this roiling narrative; another is the civil rights struggle; a third is the government regulation (and deregulation) of sexuality. Boyle \\u201ccovers the range of material you would expect from any foundational account of the 1960s and the penumbra around it \\u2014 Kennedy in Dallas, King in Memphis, unrest in Newark and Watts, LSD and the pill,\\u201d our critic Jennifer Szalai says. \\u201cBut he also writes about those moments that can sometimes get lost in the deluge.\\u201d\", \"OUR COUNTRY FRIENDS, by Gary Shteyngart. (Random House, $28.) Shteyngart\\u2019s fifth novel begins at the onset of the pandemic, with seven friends and one nemesis gathered at an estate in the Hudson Valley to wait out what they\\u2019re sure will be a quick blip in their convenient and prosperous lives. \\u201c\\u2018Our Country Friends\\u2019 is brilliant about so much: the humiliations of parenting and of being parented; the sadism of chronic illness; the glory of friendship,\\u201d our critic Molly Young writes. \\u201cTo read this novel is to tally a high school yearbook\\u2019s worth of superlatives for Shteyngart: funniest, noisiest, sweetest, most entertaining.\\u201d\", \"THE RADICAL POTTER: The Life and Times of Josiah Wedgwood, by Tristram Hunt. (Metropolitan/ Holt, $29.99.) Wedgwood, the brand once synonymous with fine china, has lost much of its luster in the 21st century. So has \\u201cfine china\\u201d generally. The historian Tristram Hunt writes that his biography of the 18th-century entrepreneur who founded the brand is intended \\u201cto help more people understand the centrality of Josiah Wedgwood, as both a man and a commercial pioneer, in the annals of global design and the transformation of Britain.\\u201d Our critic Alexandra Jacobs writes that \\u201cone of the book\\u2019s many pleasures is its meticulous catalog of the china-buying public\\u2019s tastes, some whimsical and others bizarre or sinister.\\u201d\", \"FUZZ: When Nature Breaks the Law, by Mary Roach. (Norton, $27.99.) Roach examines our sometimes fraught meetings with nature, especially when human rules are applied to nonhumans. She travels to spots around the world and dives into off-the-track academic archives, making for an idiosyncratic tour with a wisecracking, ever-probing guide. \\u201cRoach delights in the disgusting details of science,\\u201d Vicki Constantine Croke writes in her review, even as she demonstrates that \\u201cthere isn\\u2019t an endlessly reproducible solution for peaceful coexistence between human and nonhuman animals. There are differences in tolerance levels among different cultures. And we can glean something from the insight and compassion of others.\\u201d\", \"RATIONALITY: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters, by Steven Pinker. (Viking, $32.) Pinker\\u2019s primer on how to reason well offers lessons on statistical significance, updating your beliefs in the light of fresh data, calculating risks and rewards in decision-making and more. It also seeks to explain why our efforts often fall short. \\u201cThese lessons are taught well,\\u201d Anthony Gottlieb writes in his review. \\u201cPinker\\u2019s jaunty demotic and occasional bar-stool sermons will not be to everyone\\u2019s taste, but the illustrative gags and cartoons are pedagogically apt. His deployment of perhaps the finest of Jewish sex jokes as a tool to explain the concept of \\u2018confounding variables\\u2019 may deserve some sort of prize.\\u201d\", \"READ UNTIL YOU UNDERSTAND: The Profound Wisdom of Black Life and Literature, by Farah Jasmine Griffin. (Norton, $26.95.) This memoir by a Columbia professor probes the role of Black literature in her life and explores her own connections to the sweeping themes in the books she reveres, making literary analysis both accessible and relevant. \\u201cGriffin\\u2019s evangelizing of Black literature does what the best sermons do,\\u201d Monica Drake writes in her review. \\u201cIt sends you back to Scripture \\u2014 Baldwin, Coates, Morrison, David Walker and others \\u2014 to discover or rediscover them, to ponder and treasure them anew.\\u201d\", \"THE MORNING STAR, by Karl Ove Knausgaard. Translated by Martin Aitken. (Penguin Press, $30.) In his haunting new novel, Knausgaard alternates between the first-person accounts of nine characters, all of whom spot a huge, bright star that has inexplicably appeared in the sky. Realist drama gradually gives way to touches of horror and an enigmatic spiritual treatise. \\u201cPlot points that might define a different novel do not define this one. That neither the star nor the stalking evil seems essential to the reading experience makes the novel even more beguiling,\\u201d Heidi Julavits writes in her review. \\u201cNone of the mysteries of \\u2018The Morning Star\\u2019 are meant to be deciphered. And I might not really care for them to be.\\u201d\", \"OUT OF THE SUN: On Race and Storytelling, by Esi Edugyan. (House of Anansi, $32.99.) In a slim volume of essays mixing memoir and social history, the novelist offers \\u201cmeditations\\u201d on an array of Black figures from around the world, from Angelo Soliman to Kehinde Wiley to Marie-Joseph Ang\\u00e9lique. \\u201cAddressing race and representation, memory and belonging, Edugyan \\u2026 explores with empathy what it means to be seen, and who remains unseen, in our current identity-conscious, visibility-obsessed culture that seems to be limping toward a new aesthetic order and politics of power,\\u201d Antwaun Sargent writes in his review.\", \"TWO-WAY MIRROR: The Life of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, by Fiona Sampson. (Norton, $27.95.) Sampson, a British poet and biographer, here performs an elegant act of rehabilitation, aiming to restore some of the luster once associated with Barrett Browning by stressing her literary innovations (the verse novel), political engagement and female friendships. \\u201cPrincipally,\\u201d John Plotz writes in his review, \\u201c\\u2018Two-Way Mirror\\u2019 pushes back against the neglect, bordering on amnesia, that has descended on a poet once widely celebrated and still capable today of chilling readers with a sudden plunge from the shared everyday into frightening depths of feeling.\\u201d\", \"I LOVE YOU BUT I\\u2019VE CHOSEN DARKNESS, by Claire Vaye Watkins. (Riverhead, $27.) In this teeming, combustible novel, a young woman (named Claire Vaye Watkins) flees her husband, baby and comfortable Midwestern life for her home state of Nevada, where she proceeds to dredge up her past. Our reviewer, Cree LeFavour, calls it an \\u201cintense, intelligent and bristly\\u201d book, both \\u201cangry and alive,\\u201d that\\u2019s distinguished by the narrator\\u2019s \\u201cbreakneck pace, frightening honesty and biting, self-deprecating humor.\\u201d\", \"HURRICANE LIZARDS AND PLASTIC SQUID: The Fraught and Fascinating Biology of Climate Change, by Thor Hanson. (Basic, $28.) Starving polar bears are an evocative symbol of global warming, but the affable and naturally curious Hanson reveals subtler, less noticed dramas in the ways animals adapt to climate change. \\u201cAt a time when the climate change discourse is focused mainly on its causes, its effects on weather and our so-far tepid efforts to address the problem, it\\u2019s good to see a book on how animals and plants are responding and faring amid the flux,\\u201d Jonathan Balcombe writes in his review. \\u201cOne of the core lessons here is that our climate emergency affects not just individual species but, inevitably, interspecies relationships.\\u201d\", \"RENEWAL: From Crisis to Transformation in Our Lives, Work and Politics, by Anne-Marie Slaughter. (Princeton University, $24.95.) Slaughter shares lessons she has learned from a long career in public life, urging readers to \\u201cface both the past and present with radical, even brutal honesty.\\u201d Our reviewer, Emily Yoffe, takes issue with aspects of the book but writes that its author is \\u201cat her most interesting when she describes being a woman leader. Slaughter believes leadership skills are not necessarily intrinsic, but can be learned. From her own life, she describes years of terror at public speaking and clinging to written remarks. She knew she needed to improve, so she started weaning herself off the page and connecting with her audience. It worked.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"0e3b6a203d9c11ecb7fa000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0e3b6a203d9c11ecb7fa000017025a03"}},
