with 70 homes red-stickered and another 400 yellow-stickered - the February rain and flooding caused widespread damage to roads, infrastructure and rural properties across the Buller District.\", \"By last December, 10 percent of those houses had been repaired and had stickers removed and about half of those who were insured had settled.\", \"Buller District Council deputy chief executive Rachel Townrow said at the briefing that when the extreme weather rain hit earlier this month, there were still a 100 or so people out of their homes from last July's flooding.\", \"A further four houses were red-stickered and 18 yellow-stickered after the recent rain.\", \"A temporary accommodation village being built on Alma Road was due to be finished before the end of the year.
