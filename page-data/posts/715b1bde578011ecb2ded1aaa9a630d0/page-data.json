At 22, Gorman became the youngest inaugural poet when she performed at the 59th Presidential Inauguration. She also recited the first-ever pre-game poem at Super Bowl LV.\", \"That was only the beginning for the 23-year-old. Since then, Gorman has appeared on the cover of Time Magazine and Variety. She has partnered with Estee Lauder and signed with IMG Models. \\u00a0\", \"Gorman told \\\"CBS Mornings\\\" co-host Gayle King that over the past year, she's felt like she was \\\"kind of shot out of a cannon and trying to fly high.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"But the nation's first ever Youth Poet Laureate said her recent success had also brought fear \\u2014 that she won't be able to live up to expectations.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I think one of the scary things about being on a rocket is just, sometimes [it] feels like the higher you climb, the harder you'll fall. And so for a lot of the year it was, I think, also frightening and terrifying,\\\" she told King. \\\"Could I live up to this expectation? Could I live up to this image and idea that people had kind of made of me?\\\" \\u00a0\", \"Many would say that Gorman exceeds expectations. And while everyone knows her name, she told CBS News that she still feels like an outsider. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"I think there's like, a little bit of impostor syndrome, because I'm such a nerd, such a geek,\\\" she said. \\\"I think when I was growing up, you know, I wasn't just, kind of a really brainy kid, I was a really Black kid, I was a really skinny kid, I was a really small kid.\\\" \\u00a0\", \"\\\"Also, a kid whose voice was kind of distorted by a speech impediment,\\\" she told King. \\\"So, all of these things kind of made me feel as 'othered,' or too different, you might say. And so, yeah, it really made me feel sometimes on the outside looking in... And I think nowadays, with more age behind me, I look back at it and I am so grateful for that experience, because all the things that make me different make me who I am. And they make me great.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"On Tuesday, Gorman released her third book this year: \\\"Call Us What We Carry,\\\" which she said would serve as a record of the baggage, and the blessings, that have been carried through the pandemic.\\u00a0\", \"Only on \\\"CBS Mornings,\\\" Gorman gave an exclusive preview of her new poem, \\\"Fugue.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Read the poem below:\\u00a0\", \"Fugue:\\u00a0\", \"Don't get us wrong.\\u00a0We do pound for what has passed,\\u00a0But more so all that we passed by-\\u00a0Unthanking, unknowing,\\u00a0When what we had was ours.\\u00a0There was another gap that choked us:\\u00a0The simple gift of farewell.\\u00a0Goodbye, by which we say to another-\\u00a0Thanks for offering your life into mine.\\u00a0By Goodbye, we truly mean:\\u00a0Let us be able to say hello again.\\u00a0\\u00a0This is edgeless doubt:\\u00a0Every cough seemed catastrophe,\\u00a0Every proximate person a potential peril.\\u00a0We mapped each sneeze & sniffle,\\u00a0Certain the virus we had run away from\\u00a0Was now running through us.\\u00a0\\u00a0We slept the days down.\\u00a0We wept the year away,\\u00a0Frayed & afraid.\\u00a0We spent days as the walking dead,\\u00a0Dreading disease & disaster.\\u00a0We awaited horrors,\\u00a0Building up leviathans before they arose.\\u00a0We could not pull our heads\\u00a0From the raucous deep.\\u00a0\\u00a0Every time we fell heart-first into the news,\\u00a0Head-first, dread-first,\\u00a0Our bodies tight & tensed with what now?\\u00a0Yet who has the courage to inquire what if?\\u00a0\\u00a0What hope shall we shelter\\u00a0Within us like a secret,\\u00a0Second smile,\\u00a0Private & pure.\\u00a0\\u00a0& so, we forage for anything\\u00a0That feels like this:\\u00a0The click in our lung that ties us to strangers,\\u00a0How when among those we care for most\\u00a0We shift with instinct,\\u00a0Like the flash of a school of fish.\\u00a0Our regard for one another\\u00a0Not tumored,\\u00a0Just transformed.\\u00a0\\u00a0By Hello, we mean:\\u00a0Let us not say goodbye again.\\u00a0There is someone we would die for.\\u00a0Feel that fierce, unshifting truth,\\u00a0That braced & ready sacrifice.\\u00a0That's what love does:\\u00a0It makes a fact faced beyond fear.\\u00a0We have lost too much to lose.\\u00a0We lean against each other again,\\u00a0The way water bleeds into itself.\\u00a0This glassed hour, paused,\\u00a0Bursts like a loaded star,\\u00a0Belonging always to us.\\u00a0What more must we believe in.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"715b1bde578011ecb2ded1aaa9a630d0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"715b1bde578011ecb2ded1aaa9a630d0"}},
