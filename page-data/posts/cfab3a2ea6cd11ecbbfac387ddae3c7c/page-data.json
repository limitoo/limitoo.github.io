Lenders use credit reports to determine whether a consumer is a good bet for a loan, which means a poor credit score can make it hard to get a mortgage, car loan or other products. Credit reports can also affect people's ability to rent an apartment and even get a job.\\u00a0\", \"The announcement comes as federal regulators and consumer advocates are increasingly scrutinizing the issue of medical debt, with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau earlier this month criticizing the nation's medical billing system for failing consumers. Errors related to medical debt are common on credit reports, and consumers often have difficulty clearing up the problems, the agency said.\\u00a0\", \"Roughly 1 in 5 U.S. households carry debt related to health care, according to the CFPB.\", \"The three top credit reporting agencies said they are making several changes in how they handle medical debt.

Its March 1 report on medical debt warned that it planned to \\\"hold credit reporting agencies accountable\\\" for inaccurate medical debt on consumer reports. The agency also said it planned to determine whether unpaid medical billing data should be included in credit reports.\\u00a0\", \"Americans complain about the big three credit reporting agencies more than any other topic, according to analysis of complaints by the CFPB. More than 6 in 10 of complaints received by the CFPB in 2021 were related to Equifax, Experian or TransUnion, the agency said.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"cfab3a2ea6cd11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cfab3a2ea6cd11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
