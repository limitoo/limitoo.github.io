With Germany taking over the presidency of the Group of 7 in January, Mr. Scholz will immediately have the spotlight on him on a host of pressing international questions.\", \"Few analysts expect Mr. Scholz to change course significantly from Ms. Merkel.\", \"To those of Germany\\u2019s allies who are hoping for a more robust stance on China and Russia and an increase in military spending that promise of continuity may be only partly reassuring.\", \"\\u201cMany of our allies are yearning for more robust German leadership but they\\u2019re unlikely to get it,\\u201d said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff of the German Marshall Fund.\", \"With so many fires burning on the international stage and some structural geopolitical shifts underway, circumstances \\u2014 and his more hawkish coalition partners \\u2014 might force Mr. Scholz\\u2019 hand, Mr. Kleine-Brockhoff said.\", \"In Europe, one of the first tests Mr. Scholz will face is how to deal with Poland, which has violated some of the democratic principles underpinning membership in the European Union but is also under pressure from neighboring Belarus, a Russian ally.\", \"Mr. Scholz\\u2019 Social Democrats are traditionally dovish on Russia, supporting projects like the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. But if Moscow launches another offensive in Ukraine, it would be a significant test.\", \"On China, the picture is more complicated.\", \"As Beijing has become more confrontational and German industry more outspoken about its dependency on the Chinese market, Germany\\u2019s China policy was ripe for evolving from the mercantilist soft touch of the Merkel era, analysts say.\", \"\\u201cThe German position will get tougher on China for structural reasons,\\u201d said Mr. Kleine-Brockhoff. \\u201cMr. Scholz is no hawk.
