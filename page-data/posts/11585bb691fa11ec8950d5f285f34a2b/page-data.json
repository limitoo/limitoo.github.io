Authorities initially considered whether an overzealous fan caused her death.\", \"\\\"A beautiful woman, nude in a street, in a nice subdivision,\\\" says reporter Carol Robinson, a CBS News consultant. \\\"That is what doesn't happen every day around here. And that is what drove this story.\\\"\", \"Kat West had hundreds of fans on OnlyFans, a subscription-only website popular with celebrities and social media influencers alike, where content providers and consumers can communicate. Just last week, 18-year-old rapper \\\"Bhad Bhabie\\\" made more than $1 million dollars posting lifestyle content on OnlyFans in only six hours.\", \"Like many, Kat West had used the site to post adult content.\", \"For three years, correspondent Maureen Maher and \\\"48 Hours\\\" have been investigating Kat's death. It's a case about an unconventional marriage, a mom with a fixation on Marilyn Monroe and the question of whether her online life could have led to her death.\", \"Lauren Kwei knows some of the risks of OnlyFans all too well. When she couldn't live on a paramedic's modest salary in New York City, Kwei says she turned to the popular platform as a way to make ends meet, posting nudes under an alias.

Was it murder and if so by whom? Could it have been an accident?\", \"There were many things about her death that struck police as odd. At the death scene, Kat's husband Jeff was oddly reserved, police say.

Jeff would not. Kat would get emotional. When she was drunk, she would get loud. She would get, umm, feisty. But \\u2026 he would sit there \\u2026 and just say \\\"OK, Boo Boo. OK. I love you. All right, baby girl.\\\"\", \"Maureen Maher: You never saw an ounce of jealousy from him? \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Brittany Driesler: Never [laughs] never.\", \"Carol Robinson: That surprised me because \\u2026 I don't think many men would feel that way.\", \"Carol says Jeff was proud of having an attractive wife. In 2014, the Wests had moved to Alabama, where he had a job as a campus police officer. The couple always made time to be together with a regular date night, including on the night of January 12, 2018. Jeff's parents had then-12-year-old Lola for the evening.\", \"Carol Robinson: They go out to a restaurant. \\u2026 You know, they have some drinks and dinner.\", \"After dinner, they stopped at a liquor store.

She enjoyed the attention.\", \"Jeff revealed he would actually photograph Kat and help her post suggestive photos online, where hundreds of paying subscribers knew her as \\\"Kitty Kat West.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Brittany Driesler: She was very out loud about it. \\u2026 She was making money.\", \"But Brittany says, for Kat, it was about a lot more than money\\u2026\\u00a0\", \"Brittany Driesler: Kat, when not behind the website, was not always confident \\u2026 Yes, you have your husband, but you always want to be pretty to others.\\u00a0\", \"\\u2026 and remarkably, Jeff seemed to love it.\", \"Brittany Driesler: Jeff got the best of both worlds \\u2026 He was able to be with his wife. \\u2026 She got what she wanted, which was I get to make my money \\u2026 I get to show off what I have \\u2026 and he's not going to leave me.\", \"Brittany says by 2018 Kat's online activity had really ramped up.

You would pull it out of the bag in the same way, where your thumbprint would be going down.\", \"But to win this case, the defense will tell the jury that Jeff West could not have murdered his wife\\u2026 because Kat wasn't murdered.\\u00a0\", \"John Robbins:\\u00a0 I've handled well over 100 murder cases \\u2026 never \\u2026 went forward on a murder case where the manner of death was classified as undetermined.\", \"Maureen Maher: What \\u2026 happened that night to Kat West?\\u00a0\", \"John Robbins: In a nutshell \\u2026 she fell, she hit her head.\", \"Robbins says police found Jeff dressed in the same clothes as seen in the security video the night before.\", \"John Robbins: There was nothing on his clothes, no liquor, no blood, no bodily fluid, no tissue, no hair. And there was no hair on the bottle \\u2026 There's no glass in her wound.\", \"And, despite what police told \\\"48 Hours,\\\" no real effort \\u2013 Robbins maintains \\u2013 to consider other suspects or theories about Kat's death.\", \"John Robbins: The only person they ever looked at was Jeff and they really never looked at it whether it was an accident.\\u00a0\", \"Maureen Maher: Was there ever a time when you or anyone in the police department \\u2026 looked into the possibility of it being an accident?\", \"Sgt. Mike Mehlhoff: Absolutely not. \\u2026 I don't want to sit here and say that I immediately ruled out an accident, but just the head trauma alone \\u2026 knowing that the body had been moved \\u2026 it was \\u2026 very hard to try to look at this as an accident.\", \"Not hard at all, insists Robbins. The two blood pools at the scene suggest that after Kat fell, she could have gotten up and fallen again.\\u00a0\", \"John Robbins: 'Cause it's clear that \\u2026 she moved around after she had that head injury.\", \"John Robbins has whittled his entire case down to only one witness \\u2013 a witness guaranteed to get the jury's attention: Kat's mother Nancy Martin takes the stand to tell the jury about her daughter's lifelong struggles. \\u00a0\", \"Maureen Maher: It's a lot of pressure.\\u00a0\", \"Nancy Martin: Yeah, it was. It really was.\", \"Carol Robinson: Martin testified that she, herself, had witnessed Kat West in an intoxicated state go outside barefoot, in any \\u2014   whether it was hot or cold, she said. She would be in varying stages of dress.\\u00a0\", \"Maureen Maher: Were you surprised at how supportive Kat's parents, particularly her mother, was of the man police say killed her daughter?\", \"Carol Robinson: You know \\u2026 I can't really recall another case where the mother of the victim and the father of the victim were so attached to the suspect.\", \"Kat's parents are even giving Jeff legal advice. They help convince him not to testify.\\u00a0\", \"John Robbins [at court]:\\u00a0 Jeff's in a good mood. He's fired up.\", \"In closing arguments, Assistant District Attorney Daniel McBrayer finally ties together the state's theory of what happened that night and why:\\u00a0 He says Jeff had lost his temper with his wife. \\u00a0\", \"Daniel McBrayer: He had a problem with her drinking and her social media usage.\", \"Prosecutors say the evidence from that night shows it: Jeff had thrown her phone into the street and clubbed her to death with the liquor bottle when she went after it. And McBrayer says the way the bottle and phone were positioned convinced authorities it could not have been an accident. \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Daniel McBrayer: There were those two items stacked perfectly together. \\u2026 right there on the street next to her body.\", \"John Robbins: Jeff loved his wife.\", \"Maureen Maher: Did you ever consider the possibility that \\u2026 this guy just snapped one night?\\u00a0\", \"John Robbins: But there's no evidence to that. He has \\u2013 does not have a history of violence.\", \"The trial is ending when prosecutors make a last-minute move. They convince the judge to let the jury consider a lesser charge than murder: reckless manslaughter. \\u00a0\", \"Carol Robinson [at court]: I think that we could see a verdict tonight.\\u00a0\", \"John Robbins: This is this is the hard part, just \\u2014   just waiting. \\u00a0 \\u00a0\", \"John Robbins: They were afraid that they were going to lose the case.\\u00a0\", \"John Robbins says he wasn't happy about the last-minute lesser charge that prosecutors introduced, and it's easy to see why. It takes the jury less than five hours to convict Jeff West of reckless manslaughter.\", \"John Robbins: Jeff is \\u2026 is stunned.\", \"Both sets of parents are also stunned by the verdict.\\u00a0\", \"WILLIAM \\\"JERRY\\\" WEST [to reporters]: That was [expletive] and you know it \\u2026\", \"John Martin: I couldn't believe it. I really couldn't.\", \"Almost three months later, Judge Bill Bostick sentenced Jeff West to 16 years.\\u00a0\", \"Maureen Maher: How did you react when you heard 16 years?\\u00a0\", \"Nancy Martin:\\u00a0 I just wanted to cry.\", \"With credit for time served, Jeff will be behind bars for 13 more years. For the prosecutors, it's a kind of split decision\\u2026 but they declare victory anyway.\", \"ADA DANIEL MCBRAYER [to reporters]: Obviously, we would have preferred a \\u2026 murder verdict. \\u2026 We're glad to get a sentence as we did.\", \"For the defense, it is a stinging defeat. Jeff knows if he had accepted that plea deal from the prosecutors, he'd probably already be home.\\u00a0\", \"John Robbins: In retrospect, that probably \\u2014   he should have taken the deal.\", \"Both sets of parents stand behind Jeff's decision.\", \"Maureen Maher: By a show of hands: Who thinks Jeff is not guilty?

Worried that Lauren might lose her job, a friend set up a GoFundMe page for her. Supporters contributed more than $100,000.
