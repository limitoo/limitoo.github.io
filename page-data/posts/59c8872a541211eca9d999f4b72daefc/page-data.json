The government called her a flight risk because her \\u201crecurring criticisms of the Philippine legal processes in the international community reveal her lack of respect for the judicial system.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Ressa was awarded the peace prize in October along with Dmitri A. Muratov, a Russian investigative journalist, for \\u201ctheir courageous fight for freedom of expression.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Ressa, the first Nobel laureate from the Philippines, is the chief executive officer of Rappler, a digital news organization that is well known for its investigations on disinformation and of President Rodrigo Duterte\\u2019s brutal five-year drug war. She is an outspoken critic of Mr. Duterte, whose government has filed seven criminal charges against her, including cyberlibel and tax evasion.\", \"The ruling on Friday came after days of growing international pressure to allow Ms. Ressa to attend the ceremony, which will be held in Oslo on Dec. 10.\", \"Earlier this week, the United Nations urged the Philippines to let Ms. Ressa travel to Norway, saying it was \\u201cvery concerned\\u201d about the restrictions placed on her. The International Press Institute warned that blocking Ms. Ressa from the ceremony \\u201cputs the Philippines in the company of some of history\\u2019s most repressive regimes.\\u201d\", \"The last time a government barred a Nobel Laureate from collecting an award was in 2010, when China prevented the dissident Liu Xiaobo from doing so. The only other time that an award was not collected was in 1936, when the peace prize went to Carl von Ossietzky, a German journalist detained in a concentration camp by Nazi Germany.\", \"The Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, the leader of Poland\\u2019s Solidarity movement, Lech Walesa and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar were also barred by their governments from attending, but their family members were allowed to collect the award on their behalf.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019d like to think that the Court of Appeals reached the resolution independently of any public opinion,\\u201d said Mr. Te, Ms. Ressa\\u2019s lawyer. \\u201cBut the Court of Appeals is composed of human beings who are aware of what\\u2019s going on. So, of course, anything they read could possibly have an influence on how they think.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Ressa is due to fly to Oslo from Manila on Dec. 8, according to Mr. Te.\", \"On Thursday, a coalition of groups from the Philippines made up of rights activists and academics called on the government to allow Ms. Ressa to go to Oslo because her presence in the ceremony is \\u201csymbolic, urgent and necessary.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis brings great honor and recognition not only to Ms. Ressa, but to the Philippines, Filipinos both present and unborn, and all journalists whom she represents through this award,\\u201d the group stated.\"]","href_hash":"59c8872a541211eca9d999f4b72daefc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"59c8872a541211eca9d999f4b72daefc"}},
