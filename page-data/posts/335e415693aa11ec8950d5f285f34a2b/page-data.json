The shorter Gunner Bridge was also damaged but engineers say it can be fixed.\", \"Department of Conservation Buller operations manager Suvi van Smit said a four-person team flew in late last week to assess damage.\", \"\\\"They confirmed that Heaphy Bridge can't be fixed. It's possible that the anchor and tower foundations on the true right of the bridge can be reused. The stainless-steel fittings on the bridge can also be removed for use on the replacement.\", \"\\\"The good news is that the team found that Gunner Bridge is fixable.\\\"\", \"Parts of the Heaphy Track are open, but the section between Heaphy Hut and James Mackay Hut remains closed due to a slip on Mackay Hill.

We're very mindful of the impact the damage to these DOC visitor attractions is having on the community which is also having to deal with flood damage to infrastructure such as the Karamea highway,\\\" van Smit said.\", \"The section from K\\u014dhaihai to Heaphy Hut/Campsite and Scotts Beach Campsite is open. It can be booked through DOC's camps, huts and lodges booking system for people wanting to walk in and out on the West Coast side.\", \"The track between Brown Hut and James Mackay Hut is also open and bookings can be made for 'in and out' trips from the Golden Bay side, using Brown, Perry Saddle, Gouland Downs, Saxon and James Mackay huts and campsites, on the Great Walks booking system.\", \"Any existing bookings can be either cancelled with a full refund or re-arranged.\"]","href_hash":"335e415693aa11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"335e415693aa11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
