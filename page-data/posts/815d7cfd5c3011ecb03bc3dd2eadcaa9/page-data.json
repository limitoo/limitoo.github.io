Some homes appear to be partially flattened, while others were destroyed by the tornado. Several damaged cars can also be seen in the video.\", \"The second drone video, taken north of Saloma, shows similar widespread damage, with hundreds of trees flattened by the tornado. Several destroyed homes can also be seen.\", \"Over the past weekend, a swarm of tornadoes tracked across six states, including one in Paducah, Kentucky, that was at least three-fourths of a mile wide, according to the NWS. The weather service categorized the tornado as an EF-3, which can produce wind speeds of up to 160 miles per hour.\", \"The Lexington Herald-Leader reported that early reports from Kentucky's Division of Emergency Management suggested that the tornado started in Arkansas and traveled over 220 miles on the ground into Kentucky. If this information is confirmed by the NWS following damage assessments, it could be the longest continuous tornado in history.\", \"Several other tornadoes traveled through Kentucky, including another EF-3 tornado in Bowling Green that produced 155 mph wind speeds, the NWS said.\", \"Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear called the tornadoes the \\\"most devastating\\\" event in the state's history.\", \"\\\"The devastation is unlike anything I have seen in my life, and I have trouble putting it into words,\\\" the governor said at a press conference over the weekend. \\\"It's very likely going to be over 100 people lost here in Kentucky.\\\"\", \"During a press conference Monday morning, Beshear confirmed that 64 people have died as a result of the tornadoes, with ages ranging from 5 months to 86.\", \"Beshear issued a state of emergency in response to the tornadoes, activated the state's National Guard and requested federal assistance from President Joe Biden.\", \"A White House statement said, \\\"Today, President Joseph R.
