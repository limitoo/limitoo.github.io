Lee said its board of directors voted unanimously, 8-0, against the bid.\", \"Mary Junck, Lee\\u2019s chair, said in a statement on Thursday that Alden\\u2019s bid \\u201cfails to recognize the strength of our business today, as the fastest-growing digital subscription platform in local media, and our compelling future prospects.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe remain confident in our ability to create significant value as an independent company,\\u201d she said.\", \"Harris Kupperman, the chief investment officer of the hedge fund Praetorian Capital Management, Lee\\u2019s second-largest shareholder, objected to the Alden proposal in a letter to Lee\\u2019s board on Wednesday.\", \"\\u201cAlden\\u2019s proposed purchase price is clearly insufficient and opportunistic, grossly undervaluing the business,\\u201d Mr. Kupperman wrote. \\u201cFurthermore, their proposal comes precisely as the digital business transformation gains momentum, dramatically unlocking value for long-suffering shareholders.\\u201d\", \"Alden already owns a 6 percent stake in Lee and is seeking to add it to its stable of newspaper publishers. The hedge fund controls roughly 200 publications through its MediaNews Group subsidiary. In May, it purchased Tribune Publishing, the company behind metropolitan dailies including The Chicago Tribune and The Baltimore Sun, in a deal valued at $633 million.\", \"Alden's critics have said that its approach is to buy newspapers and wring profits from them while making drastic cost cuts that are detrimental to local journalism. Alden, which did not immediately reply to a request for comment, has said that it saves dying newspapers.\", \"Ms. Junck and Mr. Kupperman argued that Lee\\u2019s evolution into a digital-first business will significantly increase its value. Also on Thursday, Lee announced in its year-end earnings report that digital subscriptions to its newspapers had shot up 65 percent.\"]","href_hash":"d6281c18590311ec9a5fd57a4cff446e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d6281c18590311ec9a5fd57a4cff446e"}},
