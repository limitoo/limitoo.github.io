RNZ is here to clear all up.\", \"The first step is to get a test. You can get either a PCR test (nasal swab) or a rapid-antigen test.\", \"Rapid antigen testing is only available for people over 12, without symptoms, who are unvaccinated and require a test for travel. You will get a result in 15 minutes but if it is positive you will need to take a PCR test as well.\", \"If you've had a PCR test, you should get your result in 1-2 days - sometimes this is longer if your test is negative. Make sure you always have your phone on you.\", \"You need to stay home while you wait for your result.

You can call them any time of the day or night.\", \"If you or someone else needs an interpreter, Healthline will be able to sort this out for you.\", \"Within 24 hours of being told you have Covid-19:\", \"You will get a phone call from a health professional from either the Ministry of Health or a public health unit, like your DHB. Sometimes you'll get this call before you have been told you're positive. They will tell you who they are and will ask you for your name and contact details.\", \"This first phone call is called a case interview and can take up to an hour. If you don't feel well this can be done over a number of shorter phone calls.

You will also be given the details of someone who will be there for you when you have health and wellbeing needs.

If they develop symptoms, they must get a test straight away.\\nPeople in your household will need to isolate at least 10 days longer than you. This is because anyone you live with who hasn't tested positive will need to start a further 10 days of isolation once the last person in your household to test positive finishes their isolation. This is to make sure they haven't also caught Covid-19.\", \"Things have changed from the beginning of the pandemic when everyone who tested positive for Covid-19 was taken to a managed isolation facility.\\nWhether you can stay at home will depend on if you are fully vaccinated and how severe your illness is, as well as if you can isolate away from other people in your home.\\nYou and everyone in your household need to isolate away from other people. You will either do this at home, other suitable accommodation like a holiday home, or in MIQ.\\nYou will need to self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days if you are fully vaccinated and 14 days if you aren't.\\nIf you are self-isolating, you will only legally be allowed to leave your home if you're asked to have another test or because you need to access an essential health service and it can't wait until you're well, or if your safety/life or someone else's safety/life is at risk.\\nThat's all outlined in the Section 70 notice - which states what is legally required of someone with Covid-19.

But both you and your household will need to be in MIQ for 10 - 14 days after you first have symptoms. Once you have had no symptoms for 72 hours after this period, you will be sent home.\", \"Whether or not you will be able to go home will depend on where you are. You will only be allowed to leave if you and the people you are with can drive home without stopping anywhere on the way (unless it's a contactless petrol station or somewhere like a bathroom).\\nIf you took public transport or a flight to get to your destination, it's very likely you'll need to stay where you are and self-isolate there.\\nYou need to tell your accommodation provider you have Covid-19 and your close contacts will need to do the same.

If you usually work part-time and were working less than 20 hours each week, the payment is $359 per week.\\nThis is the absolute minimum amount your employer must pay you unless you usually earn less than those amounts - in that case they must pay you as they usually would.\\nThe Ministry of Social Development says employers must try their hardest to pay you your normal pay or at least 80 percent of your normal pay.\\nThere are a few people who can't get this payment.
