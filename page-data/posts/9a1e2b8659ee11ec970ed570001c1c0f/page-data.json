She was elected to the council in 2013 and since then has pushed for measures such as rent control, cutting police budgets and increasing taxes on Amazon to pay for community services.\", \"The recall question on the ballot cited accusations of her leading protestors to Mayor Jenny Durkan's home and letting Black Lives Matter protestors into City Hall while it was closed due to COVID-19 restrictions. It also mentioned a small campaign finance violation that she already paid a fine for.\", \"Though Sawant denied leading the protest to the mayor's home, she said she was there. She also confirmed that she did let the protestors into City Hall, saying it was necessary for them to be heard.\", \"Thursday's latest ballot count showed 50.3 percent of voters in opposition of the recall, the margin being 232 votes out of over 40,000.\", \"However, election officials still have to certify the results. They said they will do so by December 17, but must first resolve 591 challenged ballots. They were challenged because of concerns over the voter signatures.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949441/kshama-sawant-seattle-city-council.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Voters decided not to recall controversial Seattle Councilmember Kshama Sawant by a narrow margin. Above, Sawant speaks to supporters following the recall election, December 7, 2021, in Seattle. </div>\", \"There are no mandatory recount requirements for local ballot measures in Washington state, but either side could request one.\", \"If Sawant survives the recall, it would be a boost to Seattle's far left, which experienced setbacks in last month's general election when business-friendly candidates won the mayor's office and a council seat.\", \"Sawant was benefiting from votes in the mail-in election trending her way in later counts. After the initial count Tuesday night 53 percent were in favor of ousting Sawant.\", \"In recent Seattle elections, more liberal candidates have tended to pick up votes in later ballot counts\\u2014which observers attribute to younger voters returning ballots later. In Washington state ballots just need to be postmarked by Election Day, not received.\", \"Sawant was elected to the City Council in 2013, and her threat to run a voter initiative drive for an immediate $15 minimum wage has been credited with pressuring business leaders and then-Mayor Ed Murray to reach a deal raising the wage to $15.\", \"But critics say she offers more rhetoric than substance and that her brash antics are incompatible with good governance. A federal appeals court recently ruled that two Seattle police officers could sue Sawant for defamation after she said a fatal shooting they were involved in was \\\"a blatant murder.\\\"\", \"Sawant's supporters say the charges were a pretext for an effort by big business, developers and commercial real-estate interests to try to oust a legislator who had opposed them.\", \"The Associated Press contributed to this report.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949449/henry-bridger-ii-kshama-sawant-recall-seattle.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Efforts to recall Seattle city councilmember Kshama Sawant appear to have failed following a vote count, though the election will not be certified until next week.
