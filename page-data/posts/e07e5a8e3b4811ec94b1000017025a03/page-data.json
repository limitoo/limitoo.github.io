They also undercut the president\\u2019s assertion that an outline of the social policy and climate plan that he presented last week had the backing of all 50 Democratic and independent senators.\", \"\\u201cWhile I have worked hard to find a path to compromise, it is obvious compromise is not good enough for some in Congress,\\u201d Mr. Manchin said, reading from prepared remarks. \\u201cIt\\u2019s all or nothing, and their position doesn\\u2019t seem to change unless we agree to everything. Enough is enough.\\u201d\", \"He reiterated a demand to see details and a fiscal accounting of that bill\\u2019s impact, criticizing elements of an emerging compromise outlined by Mr. Biden last week, which has been negotiated largely to win Mr. Manchin\\u2019s vote.\", \"\\u201cHolding that bill hostage is not going to work to get my support of what you want,\\u201d the senator said of the infrastructure legislation. Of the social policy package, he added: \\u201cI\\u2019m open to supporting a final bill that helps move our country forward, but I\\u2019m equally open to voting against a bill that hurts our country.\\u201d\", \"In a statement, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said that the legislation being negotiated in the House met Mr. Manchin\\u2019s demands that the plan address inflation, create jobs and be fiscally responsible.\", \"\\u201cThe plan the House is finalizing meets those tests: It is fully paid for, will reduce the deficit and brings down costs for health care, child care, elder care and housing,\\u201d she said, adding \\u201cas a result, we remain confident that the plan will gain Senator Manchin\\u2019s support.\\u201d\", \"Democrats need the support of all 50 of their senators to win approval of the legislation, and all but a few of their members in the House. They are pushing the social safety net bill through Congress over unanimous Republican opposition using a special budget process known as reconciliation that shields such legislation from a filibuster.\", \"Mr. Manchin\\u2019s remarks came as progressive Democrats had dropped their demand that the Senate pass the reconciliation bill before they would agree to vote for the infrastructure plan. They made it more likely that those liberals would insist on a firm commitment from Mr. Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, another key moderate, before moving forward.\", \"Top Democrats spent the weekend feverishly working to resolve the final sticking points, including a last-ditch bid to negotiate a plan that could help address the high costs of prescription drugs.\"]","href_hash":"e07e5a8e3b4811ec94b1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e07e5a8e3b4811ec94b1000017025a03"}},
