He walks along the same paths as six generations of Uhlirs, but Ethan may be the last to work the land.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s enough labor for four people but not enough income for one,\\u201d his father, Jeff, said.\", \"Like most farmers, Jeff sells his cattle, corn and soybeans at prices set by a global commodities market, but only large farms can absorb the narrow profit margins.\", \"Though the family\\u2019s small farm is valuable \\u2014 its 880 acres are assessed at $1.3 million \\u2014 property taxes eat up most of the money it does make.\", \"Even in a good year when the farm grosses $60,000, Jeff feels lucky if he has money left over for savings.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ll have to work an hour before my funeral,\\u201d Jeff, 51, said. \\u201cI have no retirement.\\u201d\", \"For families like the Uhlirs, farming is increasingly unsustainable, as drought and extreme weather, fluctuating commodity prices and rising costs alter the economics of running a small- to midsize operation. Hundreds of family farms file for bankruptcy each year in the United States, with the largest share routinely coming from the Midwest.\", \"Nebraska\\u2019s high property taxes, which it collects from its 93 counties and reapportions, are compounded by Knox County\\u2019s shrinking population.\", \"About 8,400 people live in the county, down 26.8 percent over the last 40 years. With fewer taxpayers, farmers who own hundreds of acres must shoulder the cost of schools, roads and other public services. After paying for necessities like fertilizer, seed and pesticides, Jeff must cover a $15,965.68 property tax bill.\", \"Nebraska\\u2019s agricultural land property taxes are 46 percent higher than the national average, according to a 2019 report by the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and most farmers pay 50 to 60 percent of their net income in taxes.\", \"Sixty percent of Nebraska property taxes pay for schools.\", \"Next fall, Ethan hopes to pursue an associate degree in nursing. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that I would be able to financially support myself just living off the farm,\\u201d he said.\", \"On a crisp, bright afternoon in early October, Ethan watched his father weld their broken 1980s combine harvester head, which cuts and threshes corn.\", \"Most of \\u201cthe equipment we have, my grandfather bought,\\u201d Ethan said.\", \"Ethan had once hoped to be named the Future Farmers of America\\u2019s \\u201cStar Farmer,\\u201d just like his grandfather Arden in 1960.\", \"During the 1980s farm crisis, Arden nearly lost the farm. He took on debt and worked to pay it off up until the last few years of his life. His wife, Karen, worked for 16 years in an Alzheimer\\u2019s unit at an assisted-living facility in Verdigre.\", \"\\u201cThey never went to the dentist. They couldn\\u2019t afford to,\\u201d Jeff said. \\u201cThey never went on vacation. They never spent any money on each other.\\u201d\", \"Seeing his parents struggle, Jeff has avoided debt.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019d love to be able to buy land close to me and expand what I do, but there ain\\u2019t no way at 51 years old,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019d have to live to 160 to be able to pay it off.\\u201d\", \"Jeff\\u2019s financial situation is worse than previous generations, he said. \\u201cEvery year, the property valuations get higher and everything else don\\u2019t keep up.\\u201d\", \"The family has farmed the land for 151 years, he said. \\u201cHow do I sell it?\\u201d\", \"Payday comes once a year on the farm: in the fall, when Jeff sells cattle and crops.\", \"Knox County classifies four soil types when taxing agricultural use of land, and much of Jeff\\u2019s soil received the highest rating and a higher tax rate, despite lower yields than farms in other counties with less sandy soil.\", \"Farming becomes more challenging as he ages, Jeff says, and he wonders what it will be like without Ethan next year, when he\\u2019s at college. \\u201cAs my helper goes away, things get tougher.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAt some point, the people raising your food are going to be dead,\\u201d Jeff said. \\u201cOnce we\\u2019re gone, we\\u2019re not coming back.\\u201d\", \"The family has survived plenty of physical and personal hardships. Just months after taking over the farm in 2016, Jeff broke his neck in a car accident. And on Mother\\u2019s Day 2020, most of their home was destroyed by an electrical fire that started in the attic.\", \"The expense of unexpected health issues worries Jeff, who told his wife not to call the ambulance if he has a heart attack or stroke.\", \"\\u201cIt would break my heart if this place got lost because of me, and I\\u2019m not going to be whole again if that happens,\\u201d he said.\", \"Every year, Jeff travels to Lincoln, the state capital, to testify on property tax bills. He is also appealing how the county taxes his land.\", \"When Ethan takes over from Jeff, he will probably continue to work in a health care facility an hour or two away.\", \"To cover the property taxes, he might rent the land to another farmer or take part in the federal Conservation Reserve Program, which rents farmland for environmental restoration.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s been in the name this long,\\u201d Ethan said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to be the weak link and lose it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"de759d534c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"de759d534c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}},
