Here’s how to have a safer, peaceful and tasty holiday.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-23T23:15:12.000Z","content":"[\"This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\", \"After a sharp decline in holiday travel last year, Americans are back in a festive mood, with airline traffic this Thanksgiving season expected to rebound to prepandemic levels. For countless people, this week will be the first time they gather with family in two years.\", \"For that reason alone, this holiday season was never going to be \\u201cnormal,\\u201d exactly. And not unlike this time last year, coronavirus infections are spiking once again. So how should Americans navigate this second pandemic Thanksgiving? Here\\u2019s what people are saying.\", \"As Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told The Times, public health experts tend to avoid the word \\u201csafe\\u201d because safety is relative: Some things are safer than others, but nothing is zero risk.\", \"Of course, the biggest difference between this Thanksgiving and last is the widespread availability of vaccines that greatly reduce Covid\\u2019s risk. That\\u2019s prompted many families to make vaccination a prerequisite for an invitation.\", \"\\u201cI really do think that it\\u2019s perfectly acceptable to say, \\u2018I\\u2019m sorry you\\u2019re not vaccinated. You know, Grandma\\u2019s here, and by you coming, that increases her risk substantially,\\u2019\\u201d William Miller, an epidemiologist at The Ohio State University, told NPR.\", \"But gathering with unvaccinated guests, while less safe, isn\\u2019t necessarily unreasonable. \\u201cIn navigating risks, so much of what is involved is personal risk tolerance and judgments about benefits,\\u201d Nuzzo said. \\u201cThough I\\u2019m generally more comfortable in social gatherings where the adults are vaccinated, if the event were important to me, I may be willing to assume some additional risk from being around unvaccinated people.\\u201d\", \"To mitigate that risk, Nuzzo and other experts recommend that everyone in your party take a rapid test on the day of the gathering. Even if every invitee is vaccinated, rapid testing can provide an additional layer of protection.\", \"\\u201cBreakthrough infections and Covid spread can occur, and rapid tests can help catch anyone who might be infectious, thus minimizing the chance of transmission at the event,\\u201d said Linsey Marr, an engineering professor at Virginia Tech, where she studies airborne transmission of viruses. \\u201cYou can further reduce the risk by improving ventilation and/or air filtration.\\u201d\", \"Rapid tests can also ease safety concerns for people who are especially vulnerable to Covid, like the elderly and the immunocompromised. \\u201cFor the oldest age groups, Covid presents a real risk even after vaccination,\\u201d The Times\\u2019s David Leonhardt writes. \\u201cAs a result, older Americans need protection during a surge.\\u201d\", \"[\\u201cWhy even fully vaccinated older people are at high risk for severe Covid-19\\u201d]\", \"Rapid testing is also a good way to protect children under 5, who are too young to get vaccinated, though the risk Covid poses to them is in general relatively small. \\u201cThere\\u2019s still a lot of virus in the community, but the truth of the matter is, little kids are not exceedingly susceptible to disease with this virus,\\u201d said Michael Mina, an immunologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\", \"Over the years, Thanksgiving has garnered a reputation for being a crucible of family conflict, particularly of the political kind. But as my colleague Giovanni Russonello wrote last year, this clich\\u00e9 is more myth than reality: For most Americans, political debate rarely makes an appearance at the table, and not every family is allergic to it.\", \"It\\u2019s true, though, that the pandemic has created new sources of potential familial friction. Insofar as Covid vaccination is politicized, some political discussion may be inevitable. \\u201cNow it\\u2019s no longer whether you just disagree about the long-term effects of climate change,\\u201d said Jill Suitor, a sociologist at Purdue University, \\u201cbut whether you believe that having certain family members present poses a serious danger to other family members.\\u201d\", \"In the view of Abdullah Shihipar, a public health research associate at Brown University, trying to completely avoid arguments about Covid safety can be foolish. \\u201cI\\u2019d rather have a conflict with a relative now and reconcile it later than have someone die,\\u201d he said.\", \"But it\\u2019s still possible to navigate these conflicts gracefully, Emily Esfahani Smith, a doctoral student in clinical psychology, argues in The Times. After you have the vaccine conversation, banish politics from the table if you know it could lead to a blowup. And perhaps even more effective than avoiding politics, she says, is extending grace to one another.\", \"\\u201cThis means assuming good faith, despite how annoying or passive-aggressive family members are acting,\\u201d she writes. \\u201cThough the pandemic has increased tensions within families, it has also created an opening. Now more than ever, people are recognizing the importance of being together \\u2014 and how precious and fleeting life can be.\\u201d\", \"If you anticipate unavoidable, intolerable conflict \\u2014 or if you\\u2019re simply not feeling up to the occasion \\u2014 skipping Thanksgiving is also an option. \\u201cThings are still shaken up, and a lot of us (me, for instance) still feel fragile,\\u201d Elazar Sontag writes in Eater. \\u201cThis could, then, be the perfect year to politely decline the invitations, rain check the family reunions, and do something for ourselves. Why not take a trip?\\u201d\", \"Depending on whose invitation you\\u2019re declining, though, it may not be a decision to take lightly. \\u201cUnderstand that not showing up is likely to have consequences for your relationships,\\u201d says Peter T. Coleman, a professor of psychology and education at Columbia. \\u201cIf you decide to stay away, I would recommend informing people beforehand in as clear and respectful a way as possible.\\u201d\", \"As the Times Food columnist Melissa Clark wrote last year, perhaps a little mournfully, \\u201cThe whole point of Thanksgiving is to go big: a huge turkey surrounded by a bevy of sides and what\\u2019s never too many pies, all devoured by relatives who may or may not be under the influence of free-flowing wine.\\u201d\", \"That this cornucopian fantasy was out of reach for so many last November is, for some menu planners, all the more reason to recommit now to the bit, to cook, as The Times\\u2019s Sam Sifton is planning, \\u201cwith abandon and joy.\\u201d\", \"But just as last year, there are also good reasons to simplify. For one thing, because of a mix of supply-chain problems, high transportation expenses, labor shortages and trade policies, this year\\u2019s could be the most expensive Thanksgiving meal in the history of the holiday, The Times\\u2019s Kim Severson reports.\", \"And that\\u2019s just accounting for the food. If you plan to use rapid tests, be aware that unlike in many other countries, they are scarce and expensive in the United States, costing around $12 or more apiece. \\u201cThis year, tests, not turkeys, might turn out to be the most expensive, prep-heavy fixtures of many a Thanksgiving table,\\u201d Katherine J. Wu writes in The Atlantic.\", \"The expense is perhaps \\u201cjust another reason to try and get invited to someone else\\u2019s house so your only responsibility is to bring some bottles of wine and maybe a pie,\\u201d Alan Sytsma writes at Grub Street. \\u201cYou could also outsource the cooking and order from a restaurant, but that feels like cheating, somehow. And yet, nobody will be upset if they see one of those Popeyes Cajun turkeys on the table.\\u201d\", \"If you don\\u2019t want to outsource your meal, there are still other ways to lighten the workload. My colleague Eric Kim has created a scaled-down menu for precisely that purpose, with a turkey breast instead of a whole bird at its center. Most of the dishes can be prepared with little more than a sheet pan and a large skillet, and everything cooks at 350 degrees.\", \"You could also forgo the turkey entirely: A filet (or two or three) of salmon is much quicker to prepare, while a fully vegetarian menu tends to be easier on the wallet.\", \"Clark, for her part, believes the best way to mix up Thanksgiving this year is to focus on the side dishes, \\u201cthe heroes of the holiday table.\\u201d Her top three recipes at the moment are a cheesy potato gratin, roasted carrots and squash pizza. As she told Bloomberg, \\u201cEveryone will remember the Thanksgiving they got to have pizza.\\u201d\", \"Do you have a point of view we missed? Email us at debatable@nytimes.com.
