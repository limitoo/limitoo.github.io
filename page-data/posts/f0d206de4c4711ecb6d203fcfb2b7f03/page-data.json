And fashion houses from New York to Paris have made commitments to use more plant-based materials in their collections.\", \"The current craze began to take root even before the pandemic, though, with millennials, in part inspired by a cottage industry of \\u201cplantfluencers,\\u201d spiking purchases of plants in the years leading up to 2020. Like the youngest social media users, some plantfluencers have migrated to TikTok, suggesting that an appreciation for plants may be one of the few things the app\\u2019s many Gen-Z users have in common with their elder cohort.\", \"All this to say: A plant-related gift would seem a relatively foolproof option this holiday season. Whether actually plant based or just based on plants, the selection here includes things to satisfy tastes both garden variety and eccentric, from goods made of plant-based materials, to gear for gardening and growing, to fashion for those who would rather wear their plants on their handbag (or feet).\", \"Instead of wrapping up actual edible flowers, Ms. Nelson\\u2019s book, published this month, features original photography by Adrianna Glaviano that will teach a reader how to find some themselves.\", \"The flower-based teas from The Qi \\u201cbloom\\u201d when you brew them inside this set\\u2019s included ceramic mug, which is handmade in Brooklyn.\", \"For getting little ones into veggies early.

This cosmetic glitter is not most. It\\u2019s made of BioGlitter Pure, a substance derived from wood harvested to standards set by the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, which allows it to safely biodegrade in freshwater, according to even more standards set by T\\u00dcV Austria, one of two independent certification agencies authorized by the European Bioplastics association.\", \"A refined take on stone fruit, Ms. Kiss\\u2019s amethyst \\u201cplums\\u201d are accented by delicate leafs made of gold. There\\u2019s a pair of carnelian \\u201cpeaches,\\u201d too.\", \"This nail treatment\\u2019s vegan formula includes celery seed, meadowfoam seed and chia seed oils.

The pattern on this pouch recalls the dots on the artist\\u2019s \\u201cDancing Pumpkin\\u201d featured in the exhibition.\", \"One way to extend tomato season? By burning Loewe\\u2019s candle, which lasts for 80 hours and smells, according to the brand, like \\u201cthe fresh, verdant aroma of the vines just before they burst into fruit.\\u201d Medium ($189) and small ($94) sizes are also available.\", \"A one-pound block of soap to plant next to a sink or bathtub that has a base of boricha, a roasted barley tea with antioxidants, and is infused with lavender, cedar and sandalwood essential oils.\", \"Crafted from Japanese washi paper, the five incenses in this set look like fallen tree leaves. Each has a different scent, which include jasmine, cinnamon, sandalwood, citrus and agar wood.\", \"Smelling dirty is gross. But smelling of dirt is evocative. The black-thumbed can use Demeter\\u2019s fragrance, first released in 1996, as a way to suggest they\\u2019re more capable gardeners.

Simpler than all that, this toadstool is for anyone who enjoys decorating a tree.\", \"Some monstera varieties have sold for four figures. This one would perk up a living room or kids\\u2019 room and can be sat on, stood on or drowned (in the washing machine) and it won\\u2019t even so much as wilt.\", \"Your everyday terra-cotta planter with a Bauhaus-inspired twist. The graphic lines can be painted in white, black or blue and are done by hand.\", \"The family-run Cereria Introna has been making candles in Italy since 1840.
