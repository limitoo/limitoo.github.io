I mean, we had six guys here last year from one group and it was probably the worst cherry season we've had in years so they didn't go away making a whole heap of money, but they've come back with 14 of their friends this year.\", \"\\\"I think it's just the whole experience that goes with it of the communal living, a good culture, heaps of stuff to do, affordable accommodation, and then industry and government incentives as well.\\\"\", \"Robb said Clyde Orchards upgraded its on-site accommodation for this season, workers can live in communal accommodation for $75 a week or camp for $30 and if they stay the whole season they will get half that cost back.\", \"\\\"There's been a change of demographics of staff. For a long time we've been reliant on backpackers who are in self contained vans so they didn't need much whereas the people coming now want a higher grade of accommodation.\\\"\", \"\\\"We've also put more of an emphasis on social activities, we have a cricket, touch and basketball team,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"There's also a bit to do around here. We have the lakes for swimming and boating and the hills for walking and mountain biking so we let everyone know about those as well.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"8f8ca1be5be411ec97ec0d91658e2901"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8f8ca1be5be411ec97ec0d91658e2901"}},
