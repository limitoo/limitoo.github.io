Once this was fixed, the final \\\"aliveness\\\" tests on the telescope's subsystems could be run.\", \"Thomas Zurbuchen, Nasa's director of science, said the joint US-European team working on getting Webb ready would continue to be cautious right up to the moment of launch.\", \"\\\"We're not taking any risks with Webb,\\\" he told reporters on Thursday. \\\"It's already risky enough the way it is. We're absolutely making sure that everything works.\\\"\", \"Arianespace, the French company that manages operations in Kourou, will hold a launch readiness review on Tuesday. Assuming no issues come up, the Ariane vehicle, with Webb bolted on top, will then roll out to the pad.\", \"The rocket will have a half-hour window in which to get off the ground on Friday.\", \"If bad weather or minor technical issues intervene, there are launch opportunities on 25 and 26 December, after which teams would have to stand down for a day to allow production of hydrogen and oxygen propellants at the spaceport to catch up.\", \"\\\"We reproduce the oxygen and the hydrogen on the spot and we have the capacity for three full fillings [of the Ariane rocket],\\\" explained Daniel Neuenschwander, the director of space transportation at Esa.\", \"The Ariane carries a number of modifications for the upcoming flight.\", \"In particular, special vents have been put in the sides of the nose cone fairing to ensure there is an even loss of pressure during the climb to orbit. This will ensure there is no abrupt change in environment that might damage the telescope when the fairing panels are discarded.\", \"The rocket will throw Webb on to a path that will take it to an observing station some 1.5 million kilometres from Earth.\", \"This journey should last a month, during which time the telescope will unfold its 6.5m-diameter primary mirror and the tennis court-sized shield intended to protect its observations of the cosmos from the Sun's light and heat.\", \"Webb's goal is to image the earliest objects to form after the Big Bang. These are theorised to be colossal stars, grouping together in the first galaxies.\", \"Webb will also probe the atmospheres of planets outside our solar system - so-called exoplanets - to see if they hold gases that might hint at the presence of biology.\", \"\\\"Webb will have an opportunity to study these exoplanets and answer the fundamental questions that we astronomers ask ourselves, and the public alike - are we alone? Is Earth unique? Do we have other planets out there that can host life? These are very ambitious questions that speak to all of us,\\\" said Antonella Nota, Esa's Webb project scientist.\", \"- BBC \"]","href_hash":"9ba38890611211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9ba38890611211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
