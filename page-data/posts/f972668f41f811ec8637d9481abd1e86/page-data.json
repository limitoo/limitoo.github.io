I do not come to your whanga tapu without you knowing, or come into your moana without you knowing.\\\"\", \"Later in the footage, a woman can be heard telling a woman holding the He Whakaputanga flag to turn it the right way, calling her refusal to do so \\\"disrespectful\\\".\", \"Te Tai Tokerau Border Control communications and logistics manager Nyze Manuel (Ng\\u0101ti Kahu ki Whangaroa) told Newshub another He Whakaputanga flag was worn around someone's backside at the other checkpoint.\", \"She says it's something they really took issue with.\", \"\\\"I'm not being racist or anything because I have P\\u0101keh\\u0101 blood in me, but when there's 10 M\\u0101ori and 50 other P\\u0101keh\\u0101 holding our kara (flag) upside-down, from the place of the birth of He Whakaputanga, I think they really, really, really need to check themselves,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Who wears a kara around their backside? It's an insult, it's disrespectful. And then we get one coming out flying the flag upside-down like we're in distress? You're not. How rude is that? Unbelievable.\", \"\\\"My message is very clear to them: if we want your help, we'll ask. We're fine, thank you. Nga ko hi te kainga (go home).\\\"\", \"Manuel says after threatening to overthrow the checkpoints, the protesters were met by kaum\\u0101tua, had a korero, and were then told to pick up their rubbish and go home, which they agreed to do with minimal fuss.\", \"The incident came as COVID-19 case numbers continue to grow in Northland, a region lagging behind the average on vaccination rates.\", \"Manuel said there is division in the community over the response to COVID-19 but believes it has largely been caused by misinformation. She says she has seen adults and children receive the vaccine and have no impact, so isn't worried by its impacts.\", \"\\\"I think that's what people need to understand: this is health, not personal,\\\" she said of restrictions prompted by the virus.\", \"\\\"I'm all about having choice, but remember every choice that we make, whether it's to vaccinate or not, we own it\\u2026\", \"\\\"If people choose not to take their health and look after it how another individual does, that's their choice.
