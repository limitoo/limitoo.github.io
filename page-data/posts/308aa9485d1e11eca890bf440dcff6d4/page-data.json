A total of $435,000 in scholarship money will be awarded in this year's competition, according to the nonprofit organization. Over $5 million is annually awarded through national, state and local programs, the organization said.\", \"Miss America used to be in a primetime broadcast spot but will be streamed for Thursday's competition. Shantel Krebs, Miss America president and CEO, said the decision to move to streaming is unrelated to viewership numbers.\", \"The Miss America finale on NBC had 3.6 million viewers in 2019, the lowest viewership for the pageant ever. To compare, the 1954 competition had 27 million viewers.\", \"\\\"If you say you want to be around the next 100 years, we absolutely had the desire to be streamed because that is where our future is,\\\" Krebs said, mentioning that younger people are less likely to have broadcast television.\", \"Enthusiasts and Miss America organizers believe the pageant will stay and continue to change with the times. Many participants say that the competition has been life-altering, providing opportunities for contestants professionally and personally.\", \"\\\"I think that people have the wrong idea about what Miss America is all about because it's not just about getting dressed up and being prim and proper and being perfect on stage,\\\" said Miss America 2004 Ericka Dunlap, who was able to graduate from college debt-free, founded a public relations firm and became a TV personality.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1951852/miss-america-streaming-scholarship-increase.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Miss America competition is marking its 100th birthday with Thursday's pageant, managing to maintain a complicated spot in American culture.

Yet some have voiced disappointment about the competition's attempts to adapt to contemporary mores.\", \"\\\"It's in kind of a bind because as it tries to progress, it not only loses its original identity, but becomes less entertaining to the people who like to watch it,\\\" said Margot Mifflin, author of Looking for Miss America: A Pageant's 100-Year Quest to Define Womanhood.\", \"Fans, she said, are split over the trajectory of the competition\\u2014no longer a \\\"pageant.\\\" Some want it to be about \\\"beauty and fitness\\\" while others embrace the move toward focusing on leadership, talent, and communication skills, she said.\", \"Meanwhile, the competition is still engulfed by calls for greater diversity.\", \"In the late 1930s, 40s, and 50s, \\\"rule number seven,\\\" stated contestants had to be \\\"of good health and of the white race.\\\"\", \"In 1968, there was a Miss Black America Contest to revolt against the lack of diversity, as well as a protest by several hundred women organized by the feminist group New York Radical Women, which called Miss America \\\"an image that oppresses women in every area in which it purports to represent us.\\\"\", \"It wasn't until 1984 that the first Black Miss America, Vanessa Williams, was crowned\\u2014and she relinquished her title over a nude photo scandal, receiving an apology from the organization only in 2015.

But Mifflin notes the modernization of the competition has happened \\\"well behind the broader culture in terms of women's progress.\\\"\", \"It wasn't until 2018 that the judging on physical appearance was eliminated, with the help of former Miss America Gretchen Carlson, who ended up having to step down as board chair.\", \"Carlson was part of an all-female leadership team that took over following an email scandal in which male leaders insulted former Miss Americas, denigrating their appearance, intelligence and even their sex lives.
