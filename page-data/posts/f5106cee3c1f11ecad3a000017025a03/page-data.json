He pleaded guilty to two counts of obstructing justice and was charged with trying to sell information on narcotics indictments against an American who had left probation decades earlier and was believed to be in Colombia.\", \"Federal prosecutors believed that Bonilla's assistance and cooperation merited a 40 percent reduction from sentencing, resulting in a 57-month sentence for obstruction of justice, but instead, the judge ordered he be freed immediately under supervised release.\", \"Bonilla had already spent 33 months in custody since his January 2019 arrest in Colombia on a U.S. warrant after being caught as a previously convicted Colombian drug trafficker working with Mosquera.\", \"Before the arrest, Bonilla had no previous criminal record in the U.S., although he had been convicted twice for distributing cocaine in Germany and Italy. Bonilla was thankful for the release and a second chance.\", \"\\\"I'd like to say to this honorable judge and court how much I apologize for this mistake,\\\" he said, adding that he hoped the court would give him an opportunity to \\\"rebuild my life.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1924857/courtroom.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A key witness against a police captain who leaked information about a U.S. anti-narcotics investigation will be released after helping in a case on Tuesday.

D\\u00e1vila-Bonilla told him that the Miami extradition request was imminent and that the American should leave Colombia.\", \"Prosecutor Joseph Schuster said that D\\u00e1vila-Bonilla's role in the conspiracy was minor compared to that of Mosquera. And he said that D\\u00e1vila-Bonilla had also helped with investigations against two other drug kingpins, neither of whom were identified by name.
