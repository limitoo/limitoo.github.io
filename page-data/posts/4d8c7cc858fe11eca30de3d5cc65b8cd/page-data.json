According to police, she simply dropped Bama's leash and continued with her own travel to Miami.\", \"\\\"She left the counter and said she'd make other arrangements,\\\" Tampa Airport Police Chief Charlie Vazquez told Fox 13. \\\"She came back but before she came back, she kind of dropped the leash and walked off, leaving the dog on his own in the airport.\\\"\", \"\\\"It's dangerous to leave a dog at the airport,\\\" he continued. \\\"We have the doors that open and close; the dogs can go out there and get hit by cars, which has happened before. We don't want it to happen again. She should have found a reputable rescue group and contacted them.\\\"\", \"Unlike Bama's owner, the airport did contact a rescue organization and enlisted the help of VIP Rescue. Corinn Smith responded to the call and attended the airport to help the shih tzu-mix.\", \"Smith even made the decision to take in Bama herself, hoping to nurse him back to health from the neglected state he was left in.\", \"\\\"They sheared him like a sheep,\\\" Smith told Fox 13 on Wednesday. \\\"His ears, he had mounds of matted hair on his ears, they were about four inches, and all of those toenails are gone. So he's doing really, really well.\\\"\", \"Bama was also discovered to have a severe heart murmur, a tumor on his back and several sores, plus \\\"he doesn't have that many teeth left: his gums are bleeding, but it's not stopping him from eating. He loves to eat,\\\" said Smith.\", \"\\\"He was scared of me, he would growl and lash out,\\\" she added. \\\"He's a very, very happy guy now\\u2014and we're so happy to have him.\\\"\", \"Tampa International Airport Police said they have yet to find Bama's owner or file any charges, as she purchased a one-way ticket out of Tampa.\"]","href_hash":"4d8c7cc858fe11eca30de3d5cc65b8cd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4d8c7cc858fe11eca30de3d5cc65b8cd"}},
