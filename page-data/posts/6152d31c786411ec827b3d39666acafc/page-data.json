The students who accompany her are, like James, Black \\u2014 among the few Black students at Taft, an elite school that like so many of its kind was built for wealthy white boys. Wandering the Connecticut countryside, James and her friends take a goose egg from a nest. They schedule its care, using dormitory lamps to warm the unhatched gosling, which James names Crookshanks. The egg is moved from lonely desk to lonely desk.\", \"When school staff members eventually discover the egg, unbroken and fetid, in James\\u2019s room, James is not present. A white peer has accused her of stealing $20, and James has made an excruciating calculation: Because she lacks the resources on her own to expose the interpersonal and institutional racism driving the conflict, falsely claiming responsibility is the easiest way to continue her education. James confesses and is suspended. The staff find the egg, which, James writes, \\u201chad partially broken open in their hands, sending the smell of rotting egg and partially developed goose through the hall.\\u201d\", \"She adds, \\u201cI was fine with this.\\u201d\", \"No tears for Crookshanks. But the reader holds the loss, which is not about a bird, of course, but about teenagers trying to make a home in a place that has admitted them without extending to them a sense of belonging. It\\u2019s one of a series of heartaches James layers into her fresh, funny memoir. For James, and for students like her, Taft is no nest.\", \"But it might have been. James was the first Black American legacy at Taft \\u2014 \\u201clegacy\\u201d here meaning the child (or grandchild or great-grandchild) of a graduate. (One previous Black alumnus whose daughter attended was Bermudan; the distinction would have been lost on members of the white community at Taft, but it is critical to James.) James\\u2019s father, originally from Chicago\\u2019s South Side, entered Taft through a scholarship program, and by the time James enrolls, he\\u2019s a trustee.\", \"Taft, she writes, was \\u201csimply inevitable.\\u201d But she feels alienated from other Black students because of an upbringing long on \\u201crespectability politics,\\u201d and from white students who do not view their Black and Latino peers as integral to their school. Why is James, class of 2006, the first Black American legacy? Because most Black alumni choose not to send their children. Year after year, Black students confront their \\u201cinnate otherness in this institution,\\u201d while the institution remains unchanged.\", \"This paradox, which the sociologist Shamus Khan has described as \\u201ca more diverse elite within a more unequal world,\\u201d is laid carefully bare in \\u201cAdmissions.\\u201d Black students at Taft are ignored except for their race, but James is not one to be ignored. She dresses boldly (including \\u201ca hemp cobra-stitched chain with a large paw-print bead in the center that symbolized my love for Sirius Black\\u201d) and embraces the world of fantasy. Her descriptions often rely on idiosyncratic figures \\u2014 at one point, James \\u201cAlex-Macked my way\\u201d off a chair; \\u201cpre-Season-6 Willow from \\u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\u2019\\u201d is a style influence. Where I got James\\u2019s references, I laughed. Where I had to look them up, I appreciated the enactment of her unwelcoming boarding school experience: There is a whole culture here; you\\u2019d better learn it. James\\u2019s voice is swift, charming and surprising, and it\\u2019s delightful to follow as her richly imagined dreams of boarding school are replaced by deep friendships, self-compassion and humor.\", \"James\\u2019s gift in \\u201cAdmissions\\u201d is to provide company for Black students in predominantly white spaces. The work of \\u201cAdmissions\\u201d is laying down, with wit and care, the burden James assumed at 15, that she \\u2014 or any Black student, or all Black students \\u2014 would manage the failures of a racially illiterate community. After graduation, James finds that white classmates suddenly embrace her, \\u201cas though it was normal, something we\\u2019d always just done. Suddenly, outside Taft\\u2019s gates, I was a person.\\u201d\", \"This phenomenon is about the best depiction of elite whiteness I\\u2019ve read, nailing the belonging derived from institutional affiliation, which is therefore impersonal and false, but manifests value in spite of this. James writes to illuminate her experience as a Black student at Taft. She throws just as much light on the school\\u2019s whiteness.\"]","href_hash":"6152d31c786411ec827b3d39666acafc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6152d31c786411ec827b3d39666acafc"}},
