I haven't seen him tell the details \\u2026 that match \\u2026 all the other witnesses in this case. I think he's constantly \\u2026 changed \\u2026 his story a little bit.

Again, Wagner reading from his book:\", \"Robert Wagner [audio book]: Walken and I got into an argument. \\u2026At one point, I picked up a wine bottle, slammed it on the table and broke it into pieces. Natalie was already below decks at that point.\", \"In Wagner's version of the story, he didn't smash that bottle in a jealous rage as Davern claims, but in an argument with Walken over Wood's career. In fact, he says she wasn't even in the room.\", \"Robert Wagner [2008, \\\"CBS Sunday Morning\\\" ]: I looked below. I saw Natalie was doing something with her hair. She was gonna go to bed.

She got up to retie it. She slipped on the swim step on the stern \\u2026 and was either stunned or knocked unconscious and rolled in the water. The loose dinghy floated away. My theory fits the few facts we have.\", \"Dennis Davern: That story is 100-percent false. \", \"Dennis Davern: The dinghy really wasn't banging because \\u2026 it was tied off with two lines, securely to the boat.\", \"Lt. John Corina: The reality is \\u2026 what does the evidence show? \\u2026she wouldn't go back and -- that's not her. That's not her job. \\u2026 she would never go worry about the dinghy.

Ralph Hernandez: I think I've been a cop long enough to see \\u2026 those appear to be assaultive in nature.\", \"Could the bruises have instead come from a drunken fall? Perhaps.
