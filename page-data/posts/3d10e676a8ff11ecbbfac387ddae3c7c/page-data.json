He has been charged with four counts of rape, three counts of assault and three counts of unlawful imprisonment with sexual motivation, among other charges.\", \"Downing told the judge in Whitman County Superior Court Friday he's married, has children and has lived in Elk, Washington, for the past decade.\", \"Downing's bail was set at $5 million with prosecutors arguing he's still a threat to the public. It wasn't immediately known if he has a lawyer to speak on his behalf.\", \"Prosecutors say in 2003, Downing broke into a home in Pullman and threatened a woman at gunpoint.
