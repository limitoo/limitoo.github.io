As he was being interviewed by sportscaster Kelli Stavas, a group of fans in the background began yelling, \\\"F*** Joe Biden!\\\" several times.\", \"Stavas seemingly mistook what was being yelled when she said, \\\"As you can hear the chants from the crowd \\u2013 'Let's go, Brandon.'\\\"\", \"At that point, those who have displeasure with President Joe Biden have used the \\\"Let's go Brandon\\\" chant as a rallying cry, and as a way to say the expletive version without actually saying the expletive.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946450/lets-go-brandon.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A sticker with the political slogan \\\"Let's Go Brandon\\\" is visible on a trash can in Pleasant Hill, California, November 13, 2021. </div>\", \"The \\\"Let's go Brandon\\\" chant only began in August, but it's become a popular chant among conservatives, especially those who still clamor for former President Donald Trump to be back in the White House.\", \"Even last month during the World Series in Atlanta, Georgia, where Trump attended a game, the crowd turned toward him and chanted \\\"Let's go Brandon,\\\" in which he responded with a smile and shaking his head with approval.\", \"A Major League Baseball (MLB) spokesperson said Trump requested to attend the World Series game. He was spotted hobnobbing with former running back Herschel Walker, who has announced he will run for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Trump and Walker's friendship goes back to the 1980s when Trump was an owner of the New Jersey Generals in the now-defunct USFL.\", \"Texas has been a Republican stronghold for a few decades, and its governor, Greg Abbott, faces a battle against liberal star Beto O'Rourke in 2022.\", \"Senator Ted Cruz narrowly defeated O'Rourke in the 2018 mid-term election.\"]","href_hash":"fba62342572611ec82bd6508b8a8b54d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fba62342572611ec82bd6508b8a8b54d"}},
