He's the third lawyer who could lose his ability to practice law over what he did for Trump: John Eastman faces disbarment in California, and Lin Wood this week surrendered his license in Georgia.\", \"\\\"Mr. Giuliani's effort to undermine the integrity of the 2020 presidential election has helped destabilize our democracy,\\\" wrote the three lawyers on the panel, Robert C. Bernius, Carolyn Haynesworth-Murrell and Jay A. Brozost.\", \"The panel's report will now go to the D.C. Court of Appeals for a final decision.\", \"Ted Goodman, a political adviser to Giuliani, criticized the panel's work in a statement: \\\"The decision-makers at the DC Bar Association are nothing more than an arm of the permanent regime in Washington.\\\"\", \"Goodman said the decision \\\"is also part of an effort to deny President Trump effective counsel by persecuting Rudy Giuliani\\u2014objectively one of the most effective prosecutors in American history.\\\"\", \"\\\"This is the sort of behavior we'd expect out of the Soviet Union, not America,\\\" he added, and he called on members of the D.C. Bar Association \\\"to speak out against this great injustice.\\\"\", \"Giuliani's law license in New York was suspended in June 2021 for false statements he made while trying to pursue Trump's repeatedly debunked fraud claims.\", \"Graham Kates contributed to this report.\"]","href_hash":"b7839ee21d0411ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b7839ee21d0411ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
