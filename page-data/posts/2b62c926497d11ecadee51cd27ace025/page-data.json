The expanded list will align with the vaccines cleared for use by the World Health Organization.\", \"Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada\\u2019s chief public health officer, said that the case rates associated with each of the vaccines were about the same. \", \"\\u201cAll that is very reassuring,\\u201d Dr. Tam said. She added that although Sinopharm, Sinovac and Covaxin \\u201care not authorized in Canada, because they\\u2019ve gone through the W.H.O. process in terms of evaluation of safety, of efficacy and of quality, we\\u2019ve taken that into account as we increase the list of vaccines for Canadian border measures.\\u201d\", \"Additionally, people leaving Canada by land or by air for less than 72 hours will no longer be required to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test to re-enter the country. The price and processing time of P.C.R. tests \\u2014 which can cost more than $100 and take longer than a day for results \\u2014 were widely seen as deterrents to travel.\", \"This change applies only to Canadians, permanent residents and Indigenous people registered under the Indian Act. It also takes effect Nov. 30.\", \"The government will take a firm stance against unvaccinated travelers entering and leaving the country beginning on that date as well, with \\u201cvery few exemptions,\\u201d said Omar Alghabra, Canada\\u2019s transport minister. He added that only fully vaccinated travelers would be able to fly from a Canadian airport or board a Via Rail or Rocky Mountaineer train.\", \"Starting Jan. 15, Canada will also phase out most previously granted travel exemptions for those who are unvaccinated. This will affect professional and amateur athletes, foreign students, truck drivers and other essential workers who cross the border, and adults over 18 traveling to reunite with a family member.\", \"Other categories of unvaccinated or partly vaccinated travelers \\u2014 such as refugees, marine crews and agricultural workers \\u2014 will be able to enter only with limited approval.\"]","href_hash":"2b62c926497d11ecadee51cd27ace025"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2b62c926497d11ecadee51cd27ace025"}},
