The Pilgrims in 1621 had much to be thankful for. They had arrived a year earlier with \\u201cno friends to wellcome them, nor inns to entertaine or refresh their weatherbeaten bodys, no houses or much less townes to repaire too, to seeke for succoure,\\u201d in the words of their leader, William Bradford. The Wampanoags, hoping the white settlers would help them fight other tribes, helped them survive the harsh winter. The wary allies celebrated that fall with a feast of turkeys, ducks and venison, although probably not cranberry sauce or pumpkin pie.\", \"What does giving thanks have to do with economics? A lot, actually. I apologize if this sounds like an imitation of a David Brooks column, but the truth is that a spirit of gratitude motivates precisely the behaviors that a successful economy requires, particularly patience and generosity. For this newsletter I interviewed David DeSteno, a professor of psychology at Northeastern University (about 35 miles from where the Pilgrims landed), who is one of the leading authorities on the social effects of gratitude.\", \"DeSteno\\u2019s recent papers include \\u201cGratitude Reduces Consumption of Depleting Resources,\\u201d completed last year with Shanyu Kates, and \\u201cThe Grateful Don\\u2019t Cheat: Gratitude as a Fount of Virtue\\u201d written with Fred Duong, Daniel Lim and Kates and published in Psychological Science in 2019. He published a book this year titled \\u201cHow God Works: The Science Behind the Benefits of Religion.\\u201d I also recommend a talk that he gave at Google in 2018 on the topic of gratitude.\", \"Naturally, I asked DeSteno how he celebrates Thanksgiving. \\u201cOf course everybody sits around the table and we talk about what we\\u2019re grateful for,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut if you do it once a year it\\u2019s not going to do anything for you.\\u201d Gratitude must be cultivated throughout the year, he said.\", \"Until recently, the conventional wisdom in economics was that people should use the rational part of their brains to control the emotional part. Pure reason would suppress impulsiveness, greed and lust, allowing people to save for retirement, stick to a diet and stay faithful to their spouses. But scholars \\u2014 not just DeSteno \\u2014 have come around to the idea that a more effective way to combat negative emotions is with positive emotions. It\\u2019s less stressful, too, because you\\u2019re feeling good while doing good.\", \"\\u201cGratitude gives us more patience,\\u201d DeSteno said. \\u201cIt focuses us on long-term gains over short-term satisfaction. In morality it allows us to be honest, be fair. We can reduce the cheating rate of people by 50 percent and make them more generous with profits.\\u201d\", \"There\\u2019s something odd about exhorting people to be grateful by telling them it will be good for them. After all, is it really gratitude if it\\u2019s purely instrumental? DeSteno is aware of the seeming paradox, but he says there\\u2019s no contradiction. \\u201cIn cultivating gratitude you are helping yourself, but you are also helping others,\\u201d he told me.\", \"Shakespeare\\u2019s King Lear says, \\u201cHow sharper than a serpent\\u2019s tooth it is / To have a thankless child.\\u201d David Hume, the philosopher, said, \\u201cOf all crimes that human creatures are capable of committing, the most horrid and unnatural is ingratitude.\\u201d And the comedian Louis C.K. \\u2014 every bit their equal! \\u2014 used to do a riff about a guy on a plane who got miffed when the in-flight Wi-Fi stopped working. \\u201cLike, how quickly the world owes him something he knew existed only 10 seconds ago.\\u201d\", \"In other words, gratitude doesn\\u2019t come to us easily. But it\\u2019s worth working on. DeSteno told me, \\u201cIf we were to do every day what we do on Thanksgiving, our lives would be better for it.\\u201d\", \"In that spirit, I thank you for reading this newsletter. Please send me your favorite story about gratitude using the email address below. I will share one of them in my Dec. 3 edition.\", \"57.0\", \"The preliminary reading for the Markit PMI index of eurozone manufacturing in November, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by FactSet. That would be down from 58.3 in October and a recent peak of 63.4 in June. Supply-chain bottlenecks in manufacturing are a major factor in the index\\u2019s decline. The official number will be released on Tuesday.\", \"\\u201cThe good life, as I conceive it, is a happy life.
