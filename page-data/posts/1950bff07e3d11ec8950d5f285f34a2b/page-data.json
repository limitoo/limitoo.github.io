We have not yet been informed when any stock will be available, so all sales of RAT test products have been paused indefinitely.\\\"\", \"It came after National's COVID-19 spokesperson Chris Bishop on Tuesday accused the Government of \\\"seizing rapid tests from the private sector to try and hide their incompetence from not ordering enough of them sooner\\\".\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I have been approached by a series of organisations today, all of whom have orders for rapid antigen tests about to be filled. They have been told that those orders cannot be filled because the rapid antigen tests are now going to the Government instead,\\\" Bishop said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"That the Government has now resorted to requisitioning rapid antigen tests from the private sector is a stunning indictment of the Government's incompetence over rapid antigen testing.\\\"\", \"Health Works Group's update is evidence the Government is using sweeping powers it passed into law late last year. It gave the Government power to requisition laboratory testing material, as well as equipment and staff.\\u00a0\", \"RATs have, until now, only been available for select employers and unvaccinated people to use for travel purposes.\\u00a0\", \"But Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced on Tuesday that RATs would be used more widely as part of the Government's response to Omicron.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"In Phase 1, the early stage which we're in now, we'll continue the same testing, tracing and isolation settings, as we have used before. That's because this helps us to slow Omicron down. But as the caseload grows, the settings will change,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Looking at outbreaks around the world, we've seen that where this is most important is critical workforces such as healthcare, supermarkets, supply-chains and other industries and services critical to delivering the necessities of life.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"This approach will mean that critical workers who are identified as close contacts will be able to use proof of a negative rapid antigen test to return to the workplace during their required period of isolation.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"This will minimise disruption to critical infrastructure and supply-chains, helping to keep New Zealand going. But we're also focused on making sure that we apply it to those who are deemed critical so we reduce the risk of people being exposed to a contact who may have COVID-19.\\\"\", \"Ardern appeared to encourage businesses to order RATs, despite the Government commandeering them.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We will also continue to do what we can to support businesses who, whilst they are able to seek supply of rapid antigen tests directly from manufacturers, we know that it is difficult for many to secure that supply.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"So whilst we for critical workforces will support them by providing them rapid antigen tests, we continue to encourage those businesses to also do what they can to help manage the health of their workforces and draw up contingency planning.\\\"\", \"Ardern said there were 4.6 million RATs in New Zealand - not even enough for every person. She said 14.6 million were expected over the next five weeks, with an additional 22 million on order.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We continue, as just about every country at present, to seek additional supply. But as you will have heard, it is a very competitive space for rapid antigen tests currently,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"There are currently nine types of rapid antigen tests approved by the Ministry of Health for use. A further 19 are under full technical assessment.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"This is an important process as the effectiveness of rapid antigen tests can range from 30 percent accuracy through to 80 percent accuracy.\\\"\", \"In the meantime, the Government has ramped up its PCR test, or nasal swab, capability.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We can do 60,000 tests a day, with surge capacity to nearly 78,000 tests a day, which can be sustained at a surge rate for approximately seven days.\\\"\", \"Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said RATs had been ordered months ago and the struggle was securing delivery.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We have been ordering them for months and that's why we have already quite a number onshore and they have been used and are being used by some businesses. There are over 20 businesses that are using them as part of their ongoing surveillance. They have been in use in our healthcare settings in our Delta outbreak for people arriving in emergency departments and some staff.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We certainly upped our orders in the last few months of the year last year. The issue is not so much the orders - it's getting confirmation of delivery and we're pulling out all the stops to get confirmation of the millions on order.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"1950bff07e3d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1950bff07e3d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
