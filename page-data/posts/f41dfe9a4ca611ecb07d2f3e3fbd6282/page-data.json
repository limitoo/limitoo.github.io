Not only does the equipment provide the obvious protection for teeth and jaws, it also includes sensors collecting data to help research the best way to prevent serious head injuries.

They say that the mouthguards with the sensors don't look much different from those without them.\", \"Elder said Alabama's specially designed mouthguards even include the Alabama logo.\", \"\\\"It's not like it's a bigger mouthguard, or it's bulkier or more uncomfortable,\\\" Mihalik said. \\\"They're pretty much the same form.\\\"\", \"Wisconsin nose tackle Keeanu Benton says he started wearing the mouthguards with sensors because he wanted to help provide feedback for the researchers. Benton said the mouthguards initially seemed a little big to him but that he quickly adapted.\", \"\\\"It feels just the same now,\\\" Benton said.\", \"The mouthguards with the sensors are so similar to a typical mouthguard that school officials occasionally have to remind players to be careful with them.\", \"\\\"We've noticed players are pretty hard on their mouthguards,\\\" said Kimberly Harmon, a professor of family medicine and orthopedics and sports medicine at Washington's school of medicine. \\\"They stick them in helmets. They chew on them. They don't really mind wearing the mouthguards at all, but we had to educate them a little bit on being nice to their mouthguards.\\\"\", \"The sensors collect kinematic data, including impact speed, direction, force, location and severity. NFL officials hope that data can help them figure out how to increase player safety.\", \"Sills noted that a previous study had engineers looking at every concussion that took place in NFL action over a period of several years. When they noticed concussions repeatedly occurred after players lowered their head to initiate contact, it led to the rule changes penalizing that action.\", \"Langton said the NFL is considering expanding this study to other universities.\", \"\\\"You're increasing the number of observation points,\\\" Langton said. \\\"It allows you to make more powerful observations and answer questions quicker than we could if we were using NFL data alone.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938976/sensor-mouthguard-study.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Ten NFL teams have been using sensor mouthguards for a few years, but Jennifer Langton, the NFL\\u2019s senior vice president of health and safety innovation, said that the league also wanted to collaborate with research schools with strong football programs.
