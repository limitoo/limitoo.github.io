He said he was a benefactor who gave to the camp and supported young talent. When the girl said she lived in Palm Beach, Fla., the man said, \\u201cWhat a coincidence, we live there too.\\u201d He asked for her phone number.\", \"Testifying on Tuesday in the sex-trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, the 14-year-old from Florida, now an adult identified in court only as \\u201cJane,\\u201d described for jurors how what seemed like a chance encounter with Ms. Maxwell \\u2014 the woman with the Yorkie \\u2014 and Jeffrey Epstein led to years of sexual abuse.\", \"The abuse took place at Mr. Epstein\\u2019s properties in Florida, New Mexico and New York, and at times involved groups of people, she said. Sometimes, she said, Ms. Maxwell took part in the sex acts.\", \"For years, Jane testified, she told nobody about the abuse, confiding in loved ones only after she had cut off contact with Mr. Epstein, in around 2002. Jane \\u2014 who identified herself as a working actor \\u2014 did not tell law enforcement about her allegations until after Mr. Epstein\\u2019s death in 2019, in part out of concern, she said, that she would face professional blowback in Hollywood.\", \"As the first accuser to take the stand in Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s trial, Jane painted a picture of how Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein brought her into their lives, and how what seemed like mentorship and special treatment soon evolved into sexual abuse.\", \"Weeks after the initial meeting in Michigan, Jane said, she got home from school \\u2014 it was early in her eighth-grade year \\u2014 to find that Mr. Epstein had called to invite her and her mother to his house for tea. A chauffeur came to retrieve them, and brought them to Mr. Epstein\\u2019s home.\", \"It was the first of many such visits she would make, but her mother never joined them again. The home was impressive, she said, and so were Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, even if their conduct was sometimes confusing or overwhelming.\", \"As she described those early days, Jane at times laughed at herself, gestured broadly, and spoke directly to the jury. But as she turned to her accounts of her abuse \\u2014 and later, as Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyer sought on cross-examination to challenge her recollections \\u2014 Jane\\u2019s tone grew more serious.\", \"At several points throughout Jane\\u2019s testimony, Ms. Maxwell leaned forward in her chair at the defense table, put on a pair of glasses, and took notes.\", \"\\u201cFrom the very beginning there was a lot of bragging about how they were friends with everyone,\\u201d Jane said, adding that Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein would engage in \\u201cname dropping\\u201d \\u2014 she recalled them citing public figures like Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Mike Wallace. The effect was to suggest that \\u201cthey were very well connected and affluent.\\u201d\", \"Jane said she was soon visiting Mr. Epstein\\u2019s Palm Beach home every week or two, and Ms. Maxwell was a steady presence. At first, Ms. Maxwell came across as a big sister figure \\u2014 \\u201codd and \\u201cquirky,\\u201d Jane said, \\u201cbut nice.\\u201d Jane said Ms. Maxwell took her to the movies and shopping for shirts and a cashmere sweater, and to Victoria\\u2019s Secret for underwear: \\u201cwhite cotton briefs, basic-looking ones.\\u201d\", \"But soon, Ms. Maxwell began talking to her about sex, Jane said. One day, Jane said, Ms. Maxwell was among a group of women lounging topless or naked around Mr. Epstein\\u2019s pool.\", \"Another day, when she was still 14, Jane testified, she was speaking with Mr. Epstein in his office when he told her he could introduce her to talent agents and \\u201cmake things happen\\u201d for her. Then he \\u201cabruptly\\u201d ended the conversation, took her hand, and said, \\u201cFollow me,\\u201d as he guided her outside and into the pool house.\", \"Inside, Jane said, Mr. Epstein led her to a couch and took off his sweatpants. He pulled her on top of him and \\u201cproceeded to masturbate,\\u201d she testified in a halting voice. After he was done, she said, he went into a bathroom to clean up, then \\u201cacted like nothing had happened.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI was frozen in fear,\\u201d Jane said. She testified that she did not tell anyone about what had happened inside the pool house, adding: \\u201cI was terrified and felt gross and I felt ashamed.\\u201d\", \"Shortly after that incident, Jane said, Ms. Maxwell joined them in Mr. Epstein\\u2019s bedroom; while the two adults touched each other, they guided her to join them. In later visits, Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein brought Jane to the house\\u2019s massage room, where Ms. Maxwell explained how Mr. Epstein liked to be massaged.\", \"A prosecutor, Alison Moe, asked about Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s demeanor during those incidents.\", \"\\u201cI would say it seemed very casual, like it was very normal, like it was not a big deal,\\u201d Jane said.\", \"Jane\\u2019s often emotional testimony came on the second day of Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan on charges she helped Mr. Epstein recruit, groom and ultimately sexually abuse girls as young as 14.\", \"Prosecutors have said that Jane and three other accusers, all now adults, will testify under pseudonyms or partial names in the trial.\", \"The defense has made it clear it plans to seek to undermine Jane\\u2019s credibility in cross-examination by suggesting that she is playing a role, and that she only decided to cooperate with the government and implicate Ms. Maxwell because she believed it would help her secure a claim with the Epstein victim fund, which awarded her $5 million.\", \"Late Tuesday afternoon, one of Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers, Laura Menninger, began her cross-examination by pressing Jane about the delay in reporting her claims, and sought to point out gaps in her memory of her teenage years in Florida. Her cross-examination is expected to continue Wednesday morning.\", \"Before then, Ms. Moe, the prosector, asked Jane whether she had ever publicly revealed her identity as a victim of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell.\", \"No, Jane said, nor did she want to.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve always just wanted to put this past me. I\\u2019ve moved on with my life,\\u201d Jane said. \\u201cI work in the entertainment industry and victim shaming is still very present to this day.\\u201d Talking publicly could also affect her career, she said.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t really want any part of it,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI just wanted it to go away.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9bd59f5c524811ec9e5d6993d850e6b7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9bd59f5c524811ec9e5d6993d850e6b7"}},
