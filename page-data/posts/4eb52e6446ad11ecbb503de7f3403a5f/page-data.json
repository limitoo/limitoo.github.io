director on the 2032 Olympic Games organising committee presents corruption risks, the head of Queensland's corruption watchdog has warned.\", \"The state government introduced legislation into parliament in late October to establish the organising committee for the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games.\\u00a0\", \"The committee will include five independent directors, in addition to the Brisbane Lord Mayor.\", \"The Queensland Premier and the Prime Minister are also able to nominate another four directors\\u00a0each, which could be MPs or government ministers.\", \"The organising committee will also be made up of Olympians and Paralympians, and representatives from national and internal Olympic bodies who will deliver the Games and oversee its financial management.\", \"Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) chairman Alan MacSporran said the watchdog was concerned the legislation had\\u00a0provisions to exempt elected officials from declaring conflicts of interest.\", \"\\\"The CCC has concerns with this aspect of the Bill as it presents corruption risks,\\\" he said in a submission to the parliamentary committee examining the legislation.\", \"\\\"If a conflict arises between an elected office bearer's duties and their role as a director on the Corporation it should be declared and managed.\", \"\\\"Those considerations loom large for a body which is likely to be involved in the management of substantial public funds.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Broad alignment of interests'</div>\", \"In a written response to the CCC's submission, the Department of the Premier and Cabinet said the provisions were considered necessary so elected representatives could more fully participate in board discussions and decisions.\", \"\\\"The Lord Mayor and any appointee to the board who is an elected representative, such as a minister, could have competing interests by virtue of their public duties or role within government,\\\" the response said.\", \"\\\"Further, any conflicts of interest would be managed consistent with existing governance arrangements.\\\"\", \"<img

host city on July 21 in\\u00a0Japan.(Getty Images:\\u00a0Toru Hanai)</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Serious concerns'</div>\", \"Mr MacSporran said the CCC also had \\\"serious concerns\\\" the legislation also proposed exempting members of federal parliament who are also directors on the Olympic committee from Queensland's Crime and Corruption Act (CC Act).\", \"\\\"First, there is no reason stated, and none which is apparent, which would justify exempting members of the Commonwealth parliament from the operation of the CC Act in relation to the functioning of the Corporation,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Second, the drafting of the proposed exemption is, in any event, overly broad and as a result may give rise to unintended consequences.\", \"\\\"There is no principled reason why Commonwealth parliamentarians should be exempted from this accountability regime.\", \"\\\"It would be perverse if all other directors of the Corporation were within the CCC's jurisdiction, but directors who were members of the Commonwealth parliament were not.\", \"\\\"That is particularly so given the absence of an equivalent Commonwealth integrity body with jurisdiction over members of the Commonwealth parliament.\\\"\", \"Mr MacSporran said the exemption should be removed given it was drafted in a way made federal MPs exempt in relation to any matters arising under the CC Act, not just for matters connected with the committee or Olympics.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Consultation with federal government</div>\", \"The Department of the Premier and Cabinet said the provision was changed after consultation with the federal government.\", \"\\\"In a draft version of the bill, all board directors were initially subject to the CC Act,\\\" the response said.\", \"\\\"Following consultation, the Commonwealth government specifically requested that the CC Act not apply to Commonwealth parliamentarians.\", \"\\\"The intent of clause 8(2) was for the CC Act not to apply in relation to a director who is a Commonwealth parliamentarian only as it relates to their duties as a director of the Corporation's board.\\\"\", \"<img
