Were she living now, she might have a Substack.\", \"Hurston felt America gave all its citizens \\u2014 even its Black ones, even in 1928 \\u2014 a crack at success in life, and that things were improving every decade.\", \"\\u201cI do not belong to the sobbing school of Negrohood who hold that nature somehow has given them a lowdown dirty deal and whose feelings are all hurt about it,\\u201d she wrote in the same essay. \\u201cI have seen that the world is to the strong regardless of a little pigmentation more or less.\\u201d\", \"She added: \\u201cSomeone is always at my elbow reminding me that I am the granddaughter of slaves. It fails to register depression with me. Slavery is 60 years in the past. The operation was successful and the patient is doing well, thank you.\\u201d\", \"Hurston felt, to the dismay of some of her peers, that too many Black people in America were refusing to take yes for an answer.\", \"A new collection of her work, \\u201cYou Don\\u2019t Know Us Negroes and Other Essays,\\u201d is out this month. It\\u2019s been edited by Genevieve West, an English professor at Texas Woman\\u2019s University, and Henry Louis Gates Jr. Most of its contents were printed during Hurston\\u2019s lifetime, but some essays appear here for the first time.\", \"Hurston was a gradualist. Her conservatism shows up in her instinctual wariness of the New Deal, which she viewed as governmental overreach.\", \"She was warier still about communism. \\u201cWhy would we want to swap freedom for bondage?\\u201d she asked in 1951, when the Soviet Union was thought to be wooing unhappy members of racial minorities as party members.\", \"Black people, Hurston responded, are aspirational. They don\\u2019t want \\u201cshapeless felt boots\\u201d and cabbage soup.\", \"She wanted integration but, to the dismay of many, opposed its enforcing. To her it was a matter of self-respect. \\u201cHow much satisfaction,\\u201d she asked, \\u201ccan I get from a court order for somebody to associate with me who does not wish me near them?\\u201d\", \"It was like her to have a sense of humor about it. \\u201cHow can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\\u2019s beyond me.\\u201d\", \"There was nothing doctrinaire about Hurston\\u2019s fiction. Her novels chime with her politics though, in the sense that, as West and Gates point out, she declined to offer depictions of \\u201cunambiguously centered, barefaced white racism, or of predictably noble and praiseworthy Black characters.\\u201d\", \"Her sense of humor, she wrote, derived from her sense that \\u201cwe are just as ridiculous as anybody else. We can be wrong, too.\\u201d\", \"Hurston is in league with intellectuals like the critic Albert Murray, who complained that \\u201cmost critics feel that unless brownskin U.S. writers are pissing and moaning about injustice they have nothing to say.\\u201d\", \"And she is in cahoots across time with the novelist Paul Beatty, the editor of the invaluable book \\u201cHokum: An Anthology of African American Humor,\\u201d which includes several selections of Hurston\\u2019s work.\", \"There\\u2019s a bit of Hurston in Beatty\\u2019s tone when he writes, about Maya Angelou\\u2019s classic memoir: \\u201cI already knew why the caged bird sings, but after three pages of that book I now know why they put a mirror in the parakeet\\u2019s cage, so he can wallow in his own misery.\\u201d\", \"The essays in \\u201cYou Don\\u2019t Know Us Negroes\\u201d take aim at a range of topics. Hurston writes about Black language and about spirituals, which she felt had been shorn of their jagged qualities by \\u201cglee club\\u201d renditions.\", \"There are a handful of book reviews. There\\u2019s a column of dating advice titled \\u201cThe Ten Commandments of Charm.\\u201d (\\u201cBeware the temptation of the inkwell. For a woman that delugeth a man with letters and perfumed notes shall be called \\u2018pest.\\u2019\\u201d)\", \"There\\u2019s a Marcus Garvey satire, two short pieces about noses and Hurston\\u2019s reporting, for The Pittsburgh Courier, about the 1952 trial of a wealthy Black woman who had shot her prominent white lover.\", \"In their introduction, West and Gates argue that, with this book, \\u201cHurston takes her place as a major essayist of the 20th century.\\u201d That\\u2019s true to the extent that five or six of these essays are obvious masterpieces of the form, their sting utterly intact.\", \"There\\u2019s a lot of filler here, too, though \\u2014 mundane essays that, if you removed Hurston\\u2019s name, could have been written by anyone. A long piece about Howard University, from 1925, prints pages of statements from its board of trustees. If the editors aren\\u2019t scraping the bottom of the barrel, they\\u2019re an inch or two away.\", \"This book\\u2019s long introduction is well written but not, somehow, useful. The authors devote many pages to telling you what you are about to read and cherry-picking the best quotes. It\\u2019s like watching a 15-minute trailer for the film you\\u2019re about to watch.\", \"Relevant biographical information is absent. We don\\u2019t learn how Hurston felt about her freelance writing. Did it matter to her? Who were her editors? Did she visit their offices? Was she well paid? Did she turn a lot of things down? Were her pieces ever rejected?\", \"Her essays ran in places like The Saturday Evening Post, The American Mercury and Negro Digest. Did she sometimes pitch The Atlantic or The New Yorker but settle for placement not on those mountains but on subsidiary crags?\", \"I liked this book anyway. Reading Hurston, you always wonder what shape her dignity will take next. Her style and spark were her own. When she was in high spirits, she felt \\u201cas snooty as the lions in front of the 42nd Street Library.\\u201d\", \"She wrote at the end of a different essay: \\u201cThems my sentiments and I am sticking by them.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c7083896724211ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c7083896724211ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
