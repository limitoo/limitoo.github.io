Paper, $16.95.\", \"Willa Chen is the 24-year-old caretaker for 9-year-old Bijou Adrien, though Wu\\u2019s novel sometimes frames Willa herself as a young child. Often she speaks quietly or not at all. Growing up half Chinese and half white in New Jersey, she stands out in a way that draws casual racism (at the mall, her classmates \\u201casked if the man handing out teriyaki chicken samples was my cousin\\u201d); but she simultaneously fades into the background, an outsider excluded from her peers\\u2019 easy assumption of normalcy.\", \"Willa\\u2019s sense of unbelonging is deepened by her parents\\u2019 divorce and the separate families they start with their respective new partners, leaving her dangling between half siblings. The novel features achingly copious descriptions of food, and bruising scenes of meals Willa shares but seldom enjoys with those she wishes to be closer to: her parents, Bijou, Bijou\\u2019s mother. Occasionally the narrator\\u2019s circling obsession with food weighs down the narrative, but the overall effect conveys how fraught basic functioning can be for Willa, who feels she fits in nowhere.\", \"An undercurrent of hazy resentment runs through the novel, which charts Willa\\u2019s nine months of nannying for the well-meaning but often clueless Adriens in TriBeCa. First she secretly tries on her boss\\u2019s clothes, and then, while out at a bar one night, she tries on her boss\\u2019s identity. Soon Bijou\\u2019s uncle enters the picture. He muddies the waters by provoking Willa, eliciting in her fleeting thoughts about becoming part of the Adrien family. Toward the end, Willa\\u2019s insistent quietness begins to seem willfully unyielding, even as it also grows wistful: \\u201cI was so good at being quiet, I told myself as I pressed my lips together.\\u201d A picture emerges of a young woman who wants nothing more than to conjure a home in that impossible space between hyper-visibility and invisibility, to forever forestall the cruelties of being known and thus categorized. Wu\\u2019s finely crafted sentences and crisp imagery render visceral Willa\\u2019s inner disquiet as she simmers in that ambiguity.\", \"LEAN YOUR LONELINESS SLOWLY AGAINST MINE By Klara Hveberg Translated by Alison McCullough 297 pp. HarperVia. $26.99.\", \"The dark-haired Rakel grows up in a sea of blonds, the only child of a Norwegian father and a mother of unspecified Asian heritage. Her loneliness is established by the time she enters the University of Oslo, where she impresses a professor named Jakob with her math talent. They bond over brainteasers and his book idea about the first female math professor, Sofia Kovalevskaya, who completed her doctorate in 1874. All the while Rakel\\u2019s life is circumscribed by a debilitating illness.\", \"As you might guess from its title (borrowed aslant from a Stein Mehren poem), Hveberg\\u2019s novel is filled with a self-serious sentimentality. Rakel\\u2019s intellectual prowess and twee sensibilities are carefully demonstrated and amplified throughout the book\\u2019s many sections. That childlike bearing takes on uneasy overtones when she becomes romantically involved with Jakob, who is decades older than she is and married. Reminiscing about a baby circus elephant she once fed as a young girl, Rakel abruptly dives headlong into her current predicament: \\u201cNow she\\u2019s lying in bed thinking that the trunk Jakob has between his legs is far too big.\\u201d Deeply in love, Rakel alternately expresses shame and trust in Jakob\\u2019s promise to leave his family after a fixed period of eight years.\", \"When that time comes, she\\u2019s nearly 33, and the ing\\u00e9nue persona seems to be wearing thin. \\u201cThis is how it is to rape a consenting man,\\u201d Rakel thinks while seducing him, even after he\\u2019s told her he\\u2019s staying with his wife. The rest of the novel traces her quest to overcome heartbreak and create a new mode of being. One solution turns up in an old biography of Kovalevskaya that describes the mathematician as having \\u201ca peculiar mix of childish na\\u00efvet\\u00e9 and great depth of thought.\\u201d\", \"Hveberg, a former research mathematician at the University of Oslo, structures her novel in the model of a Sierpinski gasket \\u2014 in fractal geometry, a triangular figure that \\u201ccontains smaller copies of itself on many different levels and is full of holes of various sizes.\\u201d It\\u2019s a structure used to greater effect in \\u201cInfinite Jest,\\u201d better suited to that book\\u2019s maximalist style and convoluted plotlines. In contrast, Hveberg\\u2019s material proves too thin and insular for such a recursive format, making the end result appear repetitive despite McCullough\\u2019s nimble translation.\", \"THE ARCHER By Shruti Anna Swamy 293 pp. Algonquin. $26.95.\", \"How does a girl become an artist? For Vidya, growing up in 1960s Bombay, the discovery of dance is inextricably linked to the sudden rediscovery of her long-absent mother, who bursts into Vidya\\u2019s girlhood with mercurial migraines, a baby son and a devotion to English poetry. It\\u2019s not long before she exits again, as disruptively as she entered, just as Vidya finds her life\\u2019s calling in kathak dance.\", \"Swamy\\u2019s debut story collection, \\u201cA House Is a Body\\u201d (2020), was preoccupied with birth and death. In \\u201cThe Archer,\\u201d it\\u2019s the themes of wildness and movement that recur, revealing the novel\\u2019s central concern with rhythm. Sentences undulate until they are brought up short by staccato bursts \\u2014 like those Vidya uses to describe her urgent hunger: \\u201cSweets: yogurt: milk: cream: milk: milk: milk, glass after glass, until I was sick.\\u201d Swamy plays with vibrant textual movement as Vidya awakens to her own art, and follows the coming-of-age touchstones of college, first love and then marriage, with its villainous in-laws. Her prose is so assured that even when long sentences are jostled by abrupt transitions, the effect appears dramatic and deliberate, like a dancer staring directly at the audience for an infinitesimal pause.\", \"The novel also moves deftly among narrative perspectives. Part 1 hovers over Vidya in third person as she encounters her mother and kathak. Part 2 allows Vidya\\u2019s first-person voice to break through briefly, when she gets into a flow state for the first time during dance practice. This \\u201cI\\u201d takes over completely by Part 3, when she leaves home and seeks out a pivotal mentorship from her teacher in the Versova neighborhood, an accomplished dancer whom Vidya first watches performing in a movie. Part 4 opens with the word \\u201cwe\\u201d \\u2014 Vidya is married. Soon her subjectivity seems on the verge of obliteration. \\u201cDon\\u2019t hesitate,\\u201d her teacher reinforces. \\u201cYou keep moving forward.\\u201d The novel ends with Vidya in a prickly peace with her new selfhood as it soars to the kind of epiphany that is so crucial to warding off despair, and yet so hard to sustain. \\u201cThe Archer\\u201d dazzles as it asks: How does a woman remain an artist?\"]","href_hash":"393944c1414511eca54adbac1943da9b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"393944c1414511eca54adbac1943da9b"}},
