disappearance, but no charges have been laid.\\u00a0\", \"Mr Shepherd, who now lives at Westbury, first met Ms Geertsema in 1971 and the pair started dating.\\u00a0\", \"The court was told\\u00a0Ms Geertsema was also having a relationship with a man called Micky Rowe, who lived in Westbury, and whom she intended to marry.\", \"It is alleged that Mr Shepherd told police that Ms Geertsema was in \\\"a very distressed state\\\" before she went missing and that she'd told him that she was pregnant and had cancer.\", \"However, the counsel assisting the coroner said the missing woman had visited a GP on the morning of her disappearance, and the doctor had reported she was \\\"in good spirits, was not pregnant and did not have cancer\\\".\", \"The inquest into Ms Geertsema's disappearance has
