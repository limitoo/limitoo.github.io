Ukraine says Russia's indiscriminate artillery barrage has killed thousands of civilians, left entire cities cut off from food, water and electricity and sent more than 2 million people fleeing into neighboring countries in a refugee crisis that grows by the hour.\", \"Ukrainian President Voldoymyr Zelensky says he wants to speak directly with Putin, and within the last 24 hours he's signaled new flexibility on his country's bid for NATO membership, and even the status of two Russian-held regions in the east. The nuanced shift in tone from Kyiv could create room for direct negotiations \\u2014 which so far have only enabled relatively small-scale civilian evacuations \\u2014 to expand into actual peace talks.\", \"In the meantime, Zelensky wants more help from his Western partners to fend off the Russian bombardment. He's asked for no-fly zones and for his NATO neighbors to deliver fighter jets. But those neighbors, and the U.S., fear Russia would take either move as direct involvement by the contributing country or countries and could prompt Putin to expand his war on Ukraine into an open conflict between Russia and NATO.\"]","href_hash":"9c85df4a9f9911ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9c85df4a9f9911ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
