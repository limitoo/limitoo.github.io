They have been totally silent on this. What is that about?\\\" Clyburn said Wednesday on CNN's New Day. \\\"I just don't understand how we can, as members of Congress, expect for the public to respect us when we don't demonstrate that respect ourselves.\\\"\", \"While he told Politico that he spoke with Gosar in private after learning of the video, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has yet to make any public statement condemning the congressman's post.\", \"McCarthy did not specify whether or not he instructed Gosar to take down the video but said: \\\"He took the video down and made a statement that he doesn't support violence to anybody.\\\"\", \"House Republicans seem to be following McCarthy's lead with the majority of the conference has remained largely silent on the matter.\", \"Aside from Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger who are known to fiercely oppose GOP leadership, the other 211 Republican members have not publicly criticized Gosar for the video.\", \"Cheney called McCarthy's silence \\\"a real symbol of his lack of strength, the lack of leadership in our conference right now,\\\" while Kinzinger warned that misconduct like Gosar's will continue if Republican leadership refuses to discipline their members.\", \"\\\"In a moment where you've got an avowed white nationalist in Rep. Gosar who has posted a video advocating the killing of another member, the idea that our leader will not stand against that but that he's somehow going after and allowing attacks against 13 members who are conducting themselves in a serious and substantive way is really outrageous,\\\" Cheney told the Associated Press.\", \"\\\"Of course @gop and@GOPLeader can condemn this proactively (not some sidestepping comment when asked about it.). They won't,\\\" Kinzinger tweeted on November 8. \\\"The 'arm-pit farting' of our politics is why we are failing the people.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1934559/james-clyburn-paul-gosar-censure-aoc-gop.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Majority Whip Representative James Clyburn criticized House GOP leadership for not publicly condemning Representative Paul Gosar for posting a violent video earlier this month.
