Following that loss, Perdue was recruited by Trump to challenge Kemp and is reportedly in talks to receive official fundraising and endorsement support from the former president, according to Politico.\", \"\\\"Trump's endorsement matters to Republican voters and he's going to be helpful because this race is important to him,\\\" one Perdue adviser told the news outlet.\", \"Trump has repeatedly targeted Kemp in the aftermath of the November 2020 election, after Kemp refused to embrace the former president's false claims that the race was stolen due to voter fraud.\", \"At the end of December, Trump openly called for Kemp's resignation on social media, describing the governor as an \\\"obstructionist\\\" for his failure to uphold his unsubstantiated claims. Around the same time, Trump gave his first indication that he would support Kemp's primary challenger during the state's gubernatorial election in 2022.\", \"Perdue's gubernatorial bid will come just days after voting rights activist Stacey Abrams announced that she would run for the Democratic Party's nomination for governor on Wednesday.
