It suggests biomarkers of inflammation may mediate this relationship,\\\" said Dr. Reena Mehra, director of sleep disorder research at Cleveland Clinic.\", \"\\\"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues and the disease remains highly variable from patient to patient, it is critical to improve our ability to predict who will have more severe illness so that we can appropriately allocate resources,\\\" Mehra added.\", \"The research was conducted based on data from around 360,000 COVID patients, including 5,400 who had an available sleep study record.\", \"In the process of carrying out the study, researchers examined sleep study findings and COVID positivity along with the severity of the virus, according to Cleveland Clinic. They also accounted for other influencing health conditions such as obesity, cancer, smoking, and heart and lung disease.\", \"According to the Cleveland Clinic, the new research has led to additional studies that would determine whether treatments such as positive airway pressure or oxygen administration can effectively enhance COVID outcomes.\", \"\\\"If indeed sleep-related hypoxia translates to worse COVID-19 outcomes, risk stratification strategies should be implemented to prioritize early allocation of COVID-19 therapy to this subgroup of patients,\\\" said the first author of the study Dr. Cinthya Pena Orbea of Cleveland Clinic's Sleep Disorders Center.\", \"A number of studies over the past few months have been tracking the effects of COVID on people with varying health conditions.\", \"In July, a U.K. study found a correlation between people who contracted the virus and a decline in their reasoning and problem-solving abilities.\", \"The study examined 81,337 people who had taken the Great British Intelligence Test, that measures people's different mental abilities, during the entirety of 2020. Over 12,000 respondents said that they have contracted the virus.\", \"The findings showed that those who had COVID did worse on some parts of the test than those who didn't contract the virus. Those test parts included reasoning, problem-solving, spatial planning, and target detection.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931634/sleep-disorders-could-cause-worse-covid-outcomes.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Cleveland Clinic study showed that people who have sleeping disorders experience worse COVID outcomes.
