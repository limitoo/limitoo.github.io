Chase previously sought the Republican gubernatorial nomination but lost out to Virginia Governor-elect Glenn Youngkin earlier this year.\", \"\\\"We have filed the paperwork,\\\" Chase said. \\\"We're getting things in order to run for Congress. I've not officially announced and we won't announce that until after the lines have been officially drawn because we don't know where we're going to land.\\\"\", \"\\\"Right now, quite honestly, until they draw the lines no one can really run for anything,\\\" she added. \\\"The only thing I do know is that I'm in the Senate for two more years, that's the only real guarantee that I have at this point.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928567/amanda-chase-virginia-republican-congress-2022-trump.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Republican Virginia State Senator Amanda Chase said she was \\\"getting things in order\\\" for a possible 2022 run for Congress.

Chase agreed that filing the paperwork was \\\"a strong assertion\\\" and said that she would \\\"love to take on\\\" incumbent Democratic Representative Abigail Spanberger.\", \"If Chase does decide to run for the Republican nomination, she will have competition. Fellow Republican state Senator Bryce Reeves joined a crowded list of contenders when he announced last month that he would be seeking the nomination. Other Republican candidates include Taylor Keeney, Derrick Anderson, Tina Ramirez and Gary Barve.\", \"No Democrats have announced a challenge to Spanberger, who was narrowly reelected to a second term in 2020. Winning a third term could be a tall order for the Democrat depending on the outcome of redistricting efforts. The bipartisan Virginia Redistricting Commission has been unable to agree on a new map and the matter could ultimately be decided by the Virginia Supreme Court.\", \"Chase, who has described herself as \\\"Trump in heels,\\\" wrote that Trump \\\"should declare martial law as recommended by General Flynn\\\" in a December 2020 Facebook post. In the since-deleted post, Chase baselessly claimed that Biden \\\"cheated to win\\\" and vowed to \\\"never accept these results.\\\"\", \"Before losing to Youngkin at Virginia's GOP nominating convention in May, Chase said that she would demand \\\"a full audit\\\" if she was declared \\\"anything other than the victor,\\\" citing her status as an early frontrunner and insisting that the \\\"convention is rigged.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"0974a9cc40ec11ec9e2d63f38de8c951"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0974a9cc40ec11ec9e2d63f38de8c951"}},
