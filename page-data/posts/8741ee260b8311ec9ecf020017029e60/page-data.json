The employers had lost. \", \"\\\"Legally, workers have the right to corresponding compensation and rest times or holidays.

Any work beyond that requires extra pay for overtime. \", \"But this has not been well enforced. \", \"In many of the country's biggest firms - particularly in the thriving tech sector - employees often work far longer hours and are not always compensated. \", \"Employees have grumbled about their brutal schedules over the years, and some have even tried to fight back. In 2019, a group of programmers made headlines when they launched a campaign on code-sharing platform Github, blacklisting start-ups that overworked staff from using their open-source code. \", \"Yet, gruelling 996 culture has carried on, with the government taking a hands-off approach. \", \"After all, this same work ethic has also been credited as the driver of success for these firms, some of which have since become incredibly prominent on the world stage. \", \"Like Mr Ma, who founded online retail giant Alibaba, e-commerce platform JD.com chief Richard Liu has previously defended this culture, hitting out at \\\"slackers\\\". \", \"But public anger means authorities can no longer turn a blind eye, experts told the BBC. \", \"\\\"It has reached a tipping point, and there's a real sense of urgency for the officials to get this message out now - especially after the very high-profile worker deaths,\\\" said Dr Jenny Chan from Hong Kong Polytechnic University. \", \"Earlier this year, two employees at e-commerce platform Pinduoduo died weeks apart - a young worker collapsed on the way home after working long hours, while another died by suicide. \", \"And in January, a food delivery driver set himself on fire after he was allegedly denied $770 (\\u00a3559) in overdue wages, just one month after a worker had died while delivering meals for online platform Ele.me. \", \"It is unclear if the cases were directly linked to overwork, but they caused outraged netizens to debate 996 culture and the \\\"dark side\\\" of working at some of the country's most acclaimed firms. \", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1261C/production/_120329257_gettyimages-1232553350.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A delivery rider for Meituan, one of China's biggest food delivery firms, heads out to make a food delivery after picking it up at a restaurant in Beijing</div>\", \"Numerous threads went viral on social media as other workers came forward to say they regularly worked more than 300 hours every month - far surpassing legal limits. \", \"And for many workers who are pulling in longer hours than ever amid the pandemic, enough was enough.\", \"\\\"I am so tired.
