Adorned in khakis and a fedora, he whistles the theme to \\u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\\u201d as he walks down the stairs. The director Rawson Thurber calls it \\u201ca tip of the cap to the greatest action-adventure film of all time.\\u201d\", \"That homage to the \\u201cIndiana Jones\\u201d movies also serves as something of an indicator of Netflix\\u2019s film aspirations, which have evolved over the years as its subscriber base has grown to 214 million and filmmaker resistance to its streaming-first model has waned. The company has shifted its priorities from being the place where big-name filmmakers bring passion projects that the studios find too risky. (Think Alfonso Cuar\\u00f3n\\u2019s \\u201cRoma,\\u201d or Martin Scorsese\\u2019s \\u201cThe Irishman.\\u201d) Now, the company is aiming straight for what the old-line studios do best: the PG-13, all-audience films that traditionally pack movie theaters, create a cultural moment and often transform into lucrative franchises.\", \"In the next year, Netflix is releasing more than a handful of expensive, star-studded films intended to appeal to a wide audience, from filmmakers with a history of doing just that. Shawn Levy (\\u201cNight at the Museum\\u201d) is directing Mr. Reynolds in the time-travel film \\u201cThe Adam Project.\\u201d Francis Lawrence, the director behind \\u201cThe Hunger Games\\u201d franchise, will see his fantasy-adventure \\u201cSlumberland\\u201d with Jason Momoa debut on the service next year. And Joe and Anthony Russo, the brother directing team behind \\u201cThe Avengers,\\u201d will unveil the espionage thriller \\u201cThe Gray Man\\u201d starring Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans.\", \"For Scott Stuber, Netflix\\u2019s global film chief, this is the culmination of four years of working to convince Hollywood that the service\\u2019s subscriber base is worth more than any box office returns a film can muster.\", \"\\u201cHere\\u2019s the thing about Netflix, which is kind of mind-blowing, more people are going to watch \\u2018Red Notice\\u2019 than have seen all of my other movies in their entire theatrical release combined,\\u201d said Mr. Thurber, the writer, director and producer of \\u201cRed Notice\\u201d whose credits include \\u201cSkyscraper,\\u201d \\u201cCentral Intelligence\\u201d and \\u201cDodgeball.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s how big Netflix is. It\\u2019s almost incalculably large.\\u201d\", \"Netflix has declared \\u201cRed Notice,\\u201d a globe-trotting heist film that also stars Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot, a smash success. The company said the movie was viewed 148 million hours in its first weekend on the service, marking the biggest opening weekend in Netflix\\u2019s history. But it received tepid reviews, with The New York Times calling it \\u201can expensive brandishing of star power \\u2014 only the stars haven\\u2019t got it in them\\u201d and The Los Angeles Times referring to it as a \\u201climp imitation blockbuster.\\u201d\", \"And that echoes a point that has been made about the overall quality of Netflix\\u2019s films.\", \"\\u201cI think one of the fair criticisms has been we make too much and not enough is great,\\u201d Mr. Stuber said in an interview, adding, \\u201cI think what we want to do is refine and make a little less better and more great.\\u201d\", \"Despite the reviews, Mr. Stuber is thrilled with \\u201cRed Notice\\u201d and is bullish about his upcoming slate of films, which include a mixture of prestige pictures aimed for the awards stage like Jane Campion\\u2019s \\u201cPower of the Dog\\u201d and Adam McKay\\u2019s \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up,\\u201d debuts from directors like Lin Manuel Miranda\\u2019s \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom\\u201d and Maggie Gyllenhaal\\u2019s \\u201cThe Lost Daughter,\\u201d along with more general audience fare like the R-rated thriller \\u201cThe Unforgivable,\\u201d starring Sandra Bullock.\", \"Mr. Stuber, who was a senior film executive at Universal Pictures and an independent producer making films like \\u201cCentral Intelligence\\u201d and \\u201cTed\\u201d before coming to Netflix, is satisfied that most of the resistance to Netflix\\u2019s decision to essentially abandon the exclusive theatrical window has been quashed. (The company puts some films into theaters ahead of release, but rarely for longer than about three weeks.) And that has broadened the number of stars and filmmakers willing to work on films that will largely bypass multiplexes.\", \"\\u201cFor us, it\\u2019s always been about access to material,\\u201d Mr. Stuber said, pointing to the moment that Mr. Scorsese chose to bring \\u201cThe Irishman\\u201d to Netflix as a turning point for the streaming service.\", \"That move led others to take a chance, not just on projects that studios passed on but on big-budget films, often with an R-rating, that frequently populate movie theaters, like Charlize Theron in \\u201cOld Guard,\\u201d and Chris Hemsworth in \\u201cExtraction.\\u201d Now, the goal is to expand into more PG-13 movies.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re finally getting access to that kind of material and those filmmakers and artists, and I think we\\u2019re heading in that direction in a pretty exciting way,\\u201d Mr. Stuber said.\", \"The main advantage that studios point to when comparing themselves to Netflix is their ability to create a cultural moment when they open a big, boisterous blockbuster in theaters all over the globe. David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery who will soon run the merged Warner Bros. Discovery, referenced that power during a recent talk at the Paley Center in New York.\", \"\\u201cWe can open a motion picture anywhere in the world,\\u201d he said.\", \"That distinction may not matter as much anymore.\", \"\\u201cAll of Hollywood is hanging its hat on one thing: You can\\u2019t create a zeitgeist moment from an online movie,\\u201d the media analyst Richard Greenfield said. \\u201cI would say that there are very few movies that even have zeitgeist. And there is lots of stuff creating cultural moments that will never hit theaters.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Levy knows the power of movie theaters. He directed this year\\u2019s \\u201cFree Guy,\\u201d starring Mr. Reynolds, which earned $331 million at the worldwide box office despite the constraints of the pandemic and not being based on a previously known property. He\\u2019s hoping that there will be similar recognition for \\u201cThe Adam Project,\\u201d the first movie he\\u2019s directed for Netflix. And that starts with marketing.\", \"\\u201cI think they can be a little louder and more strategic in how they tell the world something\\u2019s coming,\\u201d Mr. Levy, who is also a producer of Netflix\\u2019s \\u201cStranger Things,\\u201d said in an interview. \\u201cI think increasingly there\\u2019s an awareness that filmmakers, actors and those of us who make movies want our work seen, but we also want our work known. And I think we\\u2019re going to see an evolution of how Netflix markets and publicizes its movies in order to keep the creative community doing repeat business with Netflix.\\u201d\", \"The service has had success with the way it markets its TV shows, with \\u201cSquid Game\\u201d prompting a run on green jumpsuits for Halloween costumes and \\u201cStranger Things\\u201d causing Eggo waffles to sell out. But its films have had a harder time breaking into the broader cultural conversation.\", \"\\u201cI think it\\u2019s a movie business conundrum that we\\u2019re all having across everything in this changing entertainment landscape,\\u201d Mr. Stuber said. \\u201cHow do we make movies as culturally relevant as they were when we were kids?\\u201d\", \"One way Netflix hopes to demonstrate that its movies are having an impact is its recent announcement that it will release a weekly top 10 list of movies based on the number of hours they have been watched. The streaming company had previously been reluctant to make any sort of audience numbers public, and it counted anything that was watched for as little as two minutes as a \\u201cview.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhen you have the No. 1 movie, it\\u2019s a great feeling but it also drives conversation,\\u201d Mr. Thurber said. \\u201cAnd if Netflix is able to share their metrics in a way that is authenticated and believable, then people will understand just how big Netflix is and how many people actually watch.\\u201d\", \"The other answer is to improve the quality of the material.\", \"Mary Parent, production chief at Legendary Entertainment and Mr. Stuber\\u2019s former partner at Universal, sold \\u201cEnola Holmes,\\u201d starring Millie Bobby Brown, to Netflix in April 2020. It become one of the service\\u2019s top-watched films during the pandemic. She is currently in production on the sequel and argues that the criticism about the quality of Netflix films is unfair.\", \"\\u201cWhen you have 200 pieces of content a year, there is naturally going to be variety, and quality is subjective,\\u201d she said. \\u201cJust because something isn\\u2019t well reviewed doesn\\u2019t mean it is poor quality or that it doesn\\u2019t deliver on the promise of the premise. You turn on \\u2018Red Notice\\u2019 because you want to be entertained and see giant movie stars.\\u201d\", \"Still, Mr. Stuber split his commercial film team in two in July in an effort to both ramp up output (this year, Netflix will release 70 films) and to improve the quality of the product. Mr. Stuber said he charged the groups with spending more time working closely with their filmmakers than they have in the past. The reason? He wants better movies.\", \"\\u201cIf you have the budget to make 14 movies and you only have 11 great ones, let\\u2019s just make 11,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat is what we need to aim toward because you really are in a deeply competitive world now and you want to make sure that you\\u2019re delivering at a pace that people see greatness consistently instead of randomly.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"56d5a2a84b6d11ec8f1e1dda8f45ee32"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"56d5a2a84b6d11ec8f1e1dda8f45ee32"}},
