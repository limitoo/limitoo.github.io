In the first season, we watched as the destinies of the title character, a monster hunter named Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill), became inextricably linked with that of the tormented sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg (Anya Chalotra) and the young princess Cirilla (Freya Allan) \\u2014 whose role and powers begin to emerge in the long-awaited Season 2, which was unveiled on Dec. 17.\", \"But the show, based on a world created by the Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, also has a sense of humor that often borders on the wacky, and it has even generated a pop-rock cult earworm, \\u201cToss a Coin to Your Witcher.\\u201d The series\\u2019s stylistic range is as unpredictable as it is wide.\", \"To keep the inspiration flowing, the showrunner, Lauren Schmidt Hissrich, tapes ideas and references on a door. She was still a writer and executive producer on the Netflix superhero show \\u201cThe Umbrella Academy\\u201d when she landed her new gig, back in August 2017, so the door did double duty for a while.\", \"\\u201cWhen it was opened, it was all \\u2018Umbrella Academy,\\u2019 and when it was closed I could start delving into \\u2018The Witcher,\\u2019 \\u201d she said.\", \"Schmidt Hissrich, 43, spoke by video from Los Angeles about some of the inspirations behind \\u201cThe Witcher.\\u201d These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"Schmidt Hissrich has long loved the Jim Henson film \\u201cLabyrinth\\u201d (1986), in which the teenage Sarah is lured into a strange world of goblins and fairies.\", \"\\u201cYou have live action, you have songs, you have fun, and you also have these creatures, and they all feel of the same world,\\u201d she said. \\u201cFor \\u2018The Witcher\\u2019 we struggled at first with, \\u2018How do you have people take a story seriously when there are monsters flying left and right?\\u2019 I loved how \\u2018Labyrinth\\u2019 wrapped all these things together.\\u201d\", \"The showrunner singled out the scene in which the Junk Lady dangles the lure of material possessions to distract Sarah from her mission. \\u201cThere is that sense of, \\u2018If only I could stay here, if only I could believe this,\\u201d Schmidt Hissrich said. \\u201cAnd yet [Sarah] knows it\\u2019s not real. \\u201d\", \"She compared the scene to one in the new season in which Ciri must make a decision between the past and the future \\u2014 \\u201cand that\\u2019s really also what \\u2018Labyrinth\\u2019 is.\\u201d\", \"When she started on the series, Schmidt Hissrich felt it was important to understand where Sapkowski came from. Her research included going on a two-week trip to Poland and following Polish photographers on Instagram. Among them was Michal Koralewski, whose image of the Old Town in the medieval city of Poznan has been on her wall for a few years now.\", \"\\u201cFantasy is often represented as dire and dour and gray, and it\\u2019s all dusty because it\\u2019s the worst time in the world,\\u2019 \\u201d she said, laughing. \\u201cOne of the things that I wanted to bring to \\u2018The Witcher\\u2019 is a sense of light and color, so I was immediately attracted to the colors, the buildings, the brightness in the photo.\\u201d\", \"Schmidt Hissrich also liked that the photo does not look like a Middle Ages clich\\u00e9. \\u201cThe show doesn\\u2019t take place in our conception of the medieval world \\u2014 it\\u2019s a fantasy world with no boundaries of time and space,\\u201d she said. \\u201cA lot of times our characters speak with a little bit more modern language than you would expect. I know that\\u2019s a lot for a photograph but to me it hit all of those things.\\u201d\", \"Schmidt Hissrich does not seek out scary movies (\\u201cThey give me nightmares\\u201d) but she makes an exception for Robert Eggers\\u2019s period shocker \\u201cThe Witch,\\u201d from 2016. \\u201cThe idea of telling a horror story by what you don\\u2019t see deeply informed how we approach things in \\u2018The Witcher,\\u2019 \\u201d she said.\", \"More specifically, she draws parallels between the film\\u2019s heroine, Thomasin (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) and Yennefer. \\u201cThomasin is going for acceptance of who she is in Puritan New England, and independence and power against societal restraints,\\u201d Schmidt Hissrich said. \\u201cTheir journeys are really interesting to me, and also, more generally, the blurring of good and evil. Temptation versus resistance: That theme from \\u2018The Witch\\u2019 directly informs Yennefer\\u2019s story this season.\\u201d\", \"Schmidt Hissrich\\u2019s association with Netflix began on the \\u201cDaredevil\\u201d series a few years ago, and she wrote the episode introducing the slinky Marvel assassin Elektra Natchios in Season 2. Pulling a copy of Michael Del Mundo\\u2019s \\u201cElektra: Bloodlines\\u201d comic book from a shelf, she flipped to a couple of pages.\", \"\\u201cVisually, she goes from being a dancer to being an assassin and all of those ribbons become the blood,\\u201d Schmidt Hissrich pointed out. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a character who is forced to let all other parts of their identity fall away, to become this one thing, an assassin. Geralt is a witcher and we see what happens when that facade has to start to break down.\\u201d\", \"The choreographic element seeped into Geralt\\u2019s fight in a library in Season 2. \\u201cIt is such a beautiful dance, and it\\u2019s a very environmental fight \\u2014 he is picking up a stool here, a lamp there, because he does not have his weapons,\\u201d Schmidt Hissrich said. \\u201cThere is something that evokes ballet in it.\\u201d\", \"Sitting on Schmidt Hissrich\\u2019s desk is a lovely little teacup \\u2014 with the word \\u201cpoison\\u201d printed on it. \\u201cI love to write about contrast,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a scene in Episode 6 that\\u2019s very quiet; the music is kind of lovely and nice. And then something very violent happens. Presenting those contrasts is a way to keep our audience on board.\\u201d\", \"Clearly, \\u201cThe Witcher\\u201d has its share of sex and violence, but it does not uncomfortably linger on either, unlike other series that may come to mind. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an adult show \\u2014 kids should not be watching it,\\u201d Schmidt Hissrich said. \\u201cBut it doesn\\u2019t mean that every time we see someone get their head cut off, we should stay on the head and see everything spurting out.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"d6ceae596d6611eca8cf25b26f9b21f9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d6ceae596d6611eca8cf25b26f9b21f9"}},
