political game is played, rather than with what the political system is delivering.\", \"And we are accused of spending too much time on \\\"race calling\\\" \\u2014 reporting on policies purely in terms of how they might affect the political prospects of the major parties.\", \"There is an argument to be made that those rules have been upended this year,\\u00a0as has so much in an era of pandemic,\\u00a0but not because journalists have necessarily mended their ways.\", \"They have been upended because pandemic politics has rewritten so many rules;\\u00a0the politics of the relationship between the federal and state governments, for starters, but also of the language of fiscal rectitude.\", \"<img

finished the year feeling a very real threat to their seats from independent candidates.(ABC News:\\u00a0Danielle Bonica)</div>\", \"But they have also been upended this year because politics, at least at a federal level, has been dominated by such an unrelenting and appalling daily diet of bad behaviour, a questionable grasp of the concept of accountability, repeated and spectacular revelations of rorting of taxpayers funds for political gain, and an almost puerile calendar of media stunts and short-lived policy positions.\", \"It says much that the gap between the information we have about how voters are feeling about our politicians, derived from published polls and focus groups, and the utter lack of quality governance served up to us has not, until now, translated into any confident predictions that the Morrison government is at serious risk of being turfed out of office \\u2014 when it eventually goes to the polls \\u2014 as its poor record this year might normally suggest.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Is change afoot?</div>\", \"Federal parliament rose after a week in which it was officially reported that the economy had once again contracted due to lockdowns that many \\u2014 including not just the opposition but state governments \\u2014 have blamed on the federal government's handling of the vaccine rollout.\", \"The fact that \\\"strollout\\\"\\u00a0\\u2014 the term that became popular to describe the government's apparently relaxed \\\"it's not a race\\\" approach to getting the population vaccinated \\u2014 was officially designated as the word of the year by the Macquarie Dictionary suggests a certain pervasiveness of that perception.\", \"Parliament also rose with one cabinet minister having been obliged to stand aside, facing allegations of abusive behaviour in a relationship with a staffer, and another cabinet minister announcing his departure from politics after a year of appalling allegations and a dismal record on the oversight of policy as both social services minister and attorney-general.\\u00a0Both men deny the allegations.\", \"A plethora of other MPs, including the health minister, are also leaving, and a number of Coalition ministers and MPs finish the year feeling a very real threat to their seats from independent candidates running on platforms focused on climate change and anti-corruption.\", \"Yet the pundits have seemed less sure than they have for years that any change is afoot.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Labor enters the climate debate</div>\", \"In all the dramas of 2021, the federal opposition has rarely featured.\", \"That's been partly because the Prime Minister's major brawls have been with the premiers, partly because the discord within the government itself has so often been the story, and partly, Labor says, because it has been waiting for the Prime Minister to destroy himself and his credibility.\", \"<img

climate strategy</div>\", \"Critics within Labor were saying 12 months ago that Anthony Albanese was leaving it too late to define himself and the party to voters who only occasionally pay attention to politics.\", \"And leaving the release of a policy which will be one of the defining ones of the 2022 election competition \\u2014 climate change \\u2014 until the day after parliament rose for the last time in 2021 and possibly even the last time before the election day is, you would have to say, cutting things very, very fine.\", \"There are a few ways to consider the policy announced on Friday.\", \"Albanese and Chris Bowen were making much of the fact that their policy didn't start with an emissions reduction target and work backwards to develop policies to reach it.\", \"This gives a rationale for coming up with an emissions reduction target of 43 per cent by 2030,\\u00a0which otherwise looks for all the world like a number that has been struck to look more ambitious than the government but not quite as ambitious as Labor itself was in 2019, when its policies were rejected by the electorate.\", \"It's a number that's roughly in line with where the business community has settled, after belatedly realising the folly for its own interests of not backing more ambitious targets in the past.\", \"But it's a number that effectively abandons any pretence of being driven by \\\"the science\\\", which says emissions reductions need to be a lot higher if the world is to limit global warming.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Let the play begin</div>\", \"Labor's climate policy will be scrutinised in an environment where, for the first time in years, it has the backing of business and many non-environmental interest groups, rather than the Coalition.\", \"In what is now a complicated race for urban seats and voters who are now focused on climate change, the Opposition is offering a much more ambitious plan than the government, and in regional seats, it is offering jobs.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/84c43769295e772fa25f0ae3740a118f\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The Opposition will use it's climate policy\\u00a0as a kick-off for its unofficial election campaign.(ABC News: Tamara Penniket)</div>\", \"Perhaps most importantly, it is offering the sorts of tangible policies voters can easily grasp: solar banks and batteries for communities and households that can't access, or afford their, own; reduced taxes on electric vehicles and an aggressive plan for a government electric vehicle fleet which will expedite the creation of a second-hand electric vehicle market, cutting the price of the cars.\", \"They are the sorts of simple policy ideas that echo the \\\"computers in classrooms\\\" and \\\"end of the health funding blame game\\\" that worked effectively for Kevin Rudd in 2007.\", \"Ambitions to improve fuel standards \\u2014 which would have potentially provided the basis for a Coalition scare campaign on petrol prices \\u2014 have been dumped in the interests of minimising the points of political attack.\", \"The Prime Minister sought to frame the way Labor's policy would be seen at a doorstop on Friday morning, before the policy was even launched, saying a 43 per cent emissions reduction target \\\"isn't safe for the Hunter, not safe for Gladstone, not safe for Belgrave, not safe for our manufacturers, not safe for jobs\\\".\", \"Which is what the government's climate campaign \\u2014 and policy thinking for that matter \\u2014 boils down to: micro-messaging to particular electorates.\", \"Is it worried about its vulnerability on climate change and whether it can persuade key regional electorates that Labor's climate policies pose a risk to jobs?\", \"It says a lot that energy and emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor had put out no fewer than five media releases on Friday morning, before Labor's policies were even unveiled, covering everything from a regional mining,\\u00a0processing and battery recycling project, to the government's emission reduction fund, and new hydrogen clusters in the regions.\", \"That's not to mention his appearance with the Prime Minister down at the Snowy Hydro 2.0 project next to a \\u2026 boring machine.\", \"There will be plenty of analysis of Labor's policy to come but the Opposition appears finally ready to use it as a kick-off for its own unofficial campaign, starting with a rally in Sydney on Sunday.\", \"Apparently, the final quarter is finally upon us. Let the play begin.\", \"Laura Tingle is 7.30's chief political correspondent.\"]","href_hash":"aa190a3d546311ec845329f5bc910712"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"aa190a3d546311ec845329f5bc910712"}},
