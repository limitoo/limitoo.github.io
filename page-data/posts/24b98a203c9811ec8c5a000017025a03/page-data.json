But, she added, \\u201cthe gap between what governments have and what the world needs is large, and the private sector needs to play a bigger role.\\u201d\", \"Financing for climate change initiatives remains an enormous point of tension at the U.N. talks. Wealthy countries have not met a promise they made more than a decade ago to raise $100 billion annually by 2020 to help poor countries \\u2014 which have contributed the least to climate change but are suffering some of the worst consequences \\u2014 make the transition to cleaner energy and build resilience to fiercer storms, droughts and rising seas.\", \"The Biden administration has promised $11.4 billion annually by 2024, but that is subject to congressional approval.

The bonds will be issued by the Climate Investment Funds, a World Bank initiative founded in 2008, that invests money contributed by countries including the United States, Britain and Japan.\", \"Many environmental groups and organizations that represent developing countries are skeptical of private finance. That is in part because most of that money tends to go toward energy projects that can turn quicker profits, rather than the less lucrative but critical work of building sea walls, planting mangroves and other efforts to help communities adapt to the effects of climate change.\", \"J\\u00f6rn Kalinski, a senior adviser at Oxfam, said in a statement that without time frames and specific dollar targets for adaptation, \\u201cpoorer nations will continue to lack the resources they need to protect lives, homes and businesses from weather disasters.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"24b98a203c9811ec8c5a000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"24b98a203c9811ec8c5a000017025a03"}},
