reduce the risk of children developing a debilitating, and sometimes fatal, genetic disease.\", \"The Parliament is debating a bill to legalise a form of assisted reproductive technology, known as mitochondrial donation, that would help parents avoid transmitting mitochondrial DNA disease to their children.\", \"Various techniques allow for an embryo to be produced using the nuclear material (DNA contained in each cell nucleus) from a man and woman, as well as the mitochondria in an egg donated by another woman.\", \"As a result, the unique genetic information from parents is still passed on to their child, but the mitochondrial defects are not.\", \"The major parties are allowing parliamentarians a conscience vote on the issue, with the House of Representatives currently debating the details.\", \"Labor frontbench MP Tanya Plibersek said she understood concerns about the technology, but that she would be voting in favour of allow it.\", \"\\\"I genuinely believe the pain, the suffering, shortened life spans, the illness that is suffered by many children who have a mitochondrial disease \\u2014 the sadness of their families and the impact on the family \\u2014 make these scientific advances worth pursuing.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5b650010d434acd40375935240f6206a\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Labor MP Tanya Plibersek said she wants to prevent further suffering by supporting the bill.\\u00a0(ABC News: Ian Cutmore)</div>\", \"Liberal MP Julian Leeser told Parliament he'd considered both the personal and theological implications of the bill.\", \"\\\"My wife suffers from endometriosis and we would not have our son James, who is 3-and-a-half, nor our daughter who is due next year, without the benefit of assisted reproductive technology,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"I therefore find myself in support of the use of this technology more broadly.\\\"\", \"As a man of Jewish faith, he consulted religious leaders about the issue, too.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/1a3d38de8ec2aeab90c289dd2c08ab49\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Liberal MP Julian Leeser said he supports the\\u00a0technology used in mitochondrial donation.\\u00a0(ABC News: Marco Catalano)</div>\", \"Liberal MP Kevin Andrews, a prominent campaigner on conservative and religious issues, rejected the notion mitochondrial donation was similar to organ transplants or other types of assisted reproductive technology (such as IVF).\", \"\\\"In current reproductive technologies, neither human eggs nor human embryos are modified in the radical ways proposed in this bill,\\\" he said.\", \"He is proposing several amendments to the bill, including one that would limit mitochondrial donation to certain methods \\\"with-out the destruction to embryos or zygotes.\\\"\", \"Liberal MP Lucy Wicks says without that amendment, she would not support the bill.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f5135b47dfd9828a4060545024f91464\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Liberal MP Lucy Wicks said she would not support the bill if it is without amendment.(ABC News: Matt Roberts)</div>\", \"Others remain unconvinced either way, such as Labor MP Tony Zappia, who is concerned the bill is being \\\"driven more so by compassion and hope than it is by proven science.\\\"\", \"In Australia, about one child a week is born with a severe form of mitochondrial disease, a rare condition that robs the body's cells of energy.\", \"Between one in 5,000 and one in 10,000 people are likely to develop severe mitochondrial disease during their lifetime, with common symptoms including developmental delays, seizures, weakness and fatigue and multiple organ failure and heart problems.\", \"In 2015, the United Kingdom became the first country to legalise mitochondrial donation and earlier this year Health Minister Greg Hunt announced his intention to introduce legislation to allow it in Australia.\", \"To ensure the bill has enough support to pass Parliament, the federal government is expected to amend its own bill by ruling out sex selection by parents and including more rigorous reporting on mitochondrial donations.\", \"Mr Andrews will pursue further amendments to limit donation techniques to those not involving the destruction of zygotes and embryos and to not permit clinical\\u00a0use until further research and trials are completed.\"]","href_hash":"c372712451f411ec923f199988903573"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c372712451f411ec923f199988903573"}},
