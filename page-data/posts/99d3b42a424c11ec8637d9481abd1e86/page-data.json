Think about the common cold, for example; like we have learned to live with the common cold. And, you know, we can take precautions to protect ourselves. We know how to get through it,\\\" said Murthy. \\\"We can ultimately get COVID, I think, to a place where it's somewhere in between the cold and the flu. Yes, it's a virus that's circulating but it doesn't disrupt our way of life, doesn't prevent us from seeing the people we love, doesn't prevent our kids from being in school.\\\"\", \"Murthy said there is \\\"good news to come\\\" as vaccines continue to prove their effectiveness and new oral antiviral medications are \\\"on the horizon.\\\"\", \"Ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, Murthy recommended that vaccinated families who will be gathering indoors with unvaccinated people do so with precautions.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I think if you're gathering indoors with vaccinated and unvaccinated people together, that is certainly a higher risk situation, especially if you're a parent like me and you've got unvaccinated kids at home because they're not eligible yet, or they haven't gotten a vaccine yet, you want to be especially cautious,\\\" he said.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"99d3b42a424c11ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"99d3b42a424c11ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
