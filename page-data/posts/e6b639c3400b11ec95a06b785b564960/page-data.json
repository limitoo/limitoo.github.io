hundreds of kilograms of fishing gear and seafood.\\u00a0\", \"The Australian Border Force (ABF) has released photographs\\u00a0showing the small colourful boats burning at sea in the wake of the three-day operation near the Rowley Shoals Marine Park off the northern Western Australian coast.\", \"The actions come\\u00a0after local tour operators raised the alarm about dozens of foreign boats in the area, saying they feared piracy during recent trips.\", \"Rear Admiral Mark Hill, who heads the Maritime Border Command, said\\u00a0three boats were destroyed and 13 others escorted out of Australian waters.\", \"\\\"We have had a busy weekend where we have encountered 16 vessels fishing illegally, and responded in conjunction with WA Fisheries,\\\" he said.\", \"<img

\"Fishing equipment was seized from the boats before they were led out of Australian waters, and a total of 630 kilograms of trepang \\u2013 or sea cucumber \\u2013 was confiscated.\", \"Admiral Hill said the Indonesian fishermen did not seem surprised by the interception.\", \"\\\"They're accustomed to it because sadly we see a few recidivists,\\\" he said.\", \"None of the fishermen were detained or prosecuted, despite that being an option previously pursued by authorities.\", \"Admiral Hill said the increase in illegal fishing was being driven by economic factors in Indonesia rather than any reduction in enforcement by Australian authorities due to COVID safety concerns.\", \"Officers were still boarding illegal vessels when needed, he said, but wearing PPE to minimise the risk of COVID transmission.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/95e6defd499755cbdac767e218941269\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Some of the catch
