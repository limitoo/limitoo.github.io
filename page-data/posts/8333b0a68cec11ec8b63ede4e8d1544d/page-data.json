Mathieu Faivre of France took the bronze.\", \"The race took place after heavy snow and high winds delayed the start by 75 minutes. Visibility was minimal, with skiers barely able to see beyond the next gate and not able to discern the safe terrain from the more slick and dangerous as they navigated the 49 gates on the steep, tight slope nicknamed Ice River.\", \"Of the 89 skiers who started the race, 33 failed to make it through the first run and advance to the second. And it wasn\\u2019t just the novices. Skiers from nontraditional skiing countries like Haiti and Ghana struggled. But so did Ryan Cochran-Siegle, the American who won the silver medal in super G last week. He skied out, as did the rising Norwegian Atle McGrath, and several other top competitors on the World Cup tour.\", \"Skiers prefer to race on a hard, consistent, even icy surface rather than trying to fight their way through six inches of fresh powder, which is what they were contending with through the morning and into the second run during the early afternoon.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s tough, but we\\u2019ve raced in tougher conditions so we knew were going to go ahead with it,\\u201d said Luca de Aliprandini of Italy, the second man down the mountain.\", \"Lucas Braathen of Norway said that working through the snow requires more effort, and beats up the body far more than zipping down a fast, groomed course.\", \"\\u201cThe problem is you are in smooth snow and then all of a sudden you are in the rough stuff and you can\\u2019t tell what is coming up next,\\u201d he said.\", \"Conditions worsened and grew slower as the race wore on, which meant that starting early on the first run proved to be a major advantage. But so, too, did the conditions: Another eight skiers failed to finish their second run.\", \"\\u201cThe conditions are the same for every man,\\u201d said Adam Zampa of Slovakia. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know whether to say we should have delayed. It\\u2019s funny because every day we have been here it has been sunny and every day after today it will be good weather.\\u201d\", \"\"]","href_hash":"8333b0a68cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8333b0a68cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}},
