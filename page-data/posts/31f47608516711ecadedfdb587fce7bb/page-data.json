What happened? Where am I living? What am I doing?\\u201d\", \"Ms. Goodrich had become familiar with American culture through her work in business development and sales in New Delhi. But when she moved to New York in search of new opportunities, she encountered a level of need that she hadn\\u2019t been expecting.\", \"Dismayed that so many New Yorkers did not have a place to sleep at night, she sought to volunteer, though she became frustrated when organizations she spoke with focused on fund-raising.\", \"\\u201cI wanted to give time,\\u201d said Ms. Goodrich, 36. \\u201cI\\u2019m like, I have time, I don\\u2019t have money. I can give my time.\\u201d\", \"She worked in a restaurant and in retail, and after a few years in Manhattan, she moved to Brooklyn, where she discovered Brooklyn Community Services, one of the nine organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.\", \"This year, she was able to start the volunteer work she\\u2019d been seeking, assisting with Brooklyn Community Services\\u2019 shower bus.\", \"The organization was building a shuttle bus with two full-size bathrooms to help those without reliable access to bathing. Ms. Goodrich had been working at a gym, where she noticed that a few of the members would skip the workout equipment and just use the showers in the locker room.\", \"The pandemic highlighted just how important hygiene was, and having worked as a restaurant hostess, Ms. Goodrich thought her hospitality skills would be a plus.\", \"\\u201cMy whole life has been preparing me for this,\\u201d said Ms. Goodrich, who began volunteering in April when the bus debuted. She added, \\u201cImmediately it spoke to me.\\u201d\", \"Brooklyn Community Services planned to begin the program in April 2020, but the start was delayed until this year because of the pandemic. Typically the bus is in service three days a week, and serves communities in East New York, Coney Island and Park Slope. As clients wait, they are offered hot meals, clothing and other resources, like H.I.V. testing and Covid testing and vaccinations.\", \"Volunteers like Ms. Goodrich help clients line up and hand out supplies like soap, shampoo and towels. They also make sure to give clients personal protective equipment, like masks and gloves, to help shield themselves against Covid-19.\", \"After each client showers, Ms. Goodrich and fellow volunteers and staff members clean the entire bathroom.\", \"\\u201cEverybody should have access to a shower,\\u201d Ms. Goodrich said. \\u201cThey deserve that.\\u201d\", \"Frank DeSimone also feels as though his life experiences have helped prepare him for volunteering. Mr. DeSimone assists at the Next Generation Center, which supports young adults who are in or aging out of foster care, have been arrested or are experiencing homelessness. The center is operated by Children\\u2019s Aid, another beneficiary agency of The Neediest Cases Fund.\", \"Mr. DeSimone grew up on Long Island, where his parents owned a grocery store. His mother dropped out of school after eighth grade, and made it clear to Mr. DeSimone and his siblings that school should be their top priority.\", \"\\u201cMy mother drilled into me, education, education, education,\\u201d said Mr. DeSimone, 67.\", \"Mr. DeSimone instilled those lessons in his three children, telling them that education could open doors.\", \"So when Mr. DeSimone retired in 2015 from his career in commercial banking, he began looking for opportunities to volunteer and learned about educational programs through Children\\u2019s Aid.\", \"\\u201cI said, \\u2018Wow, this matches so much with what I believe in,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. DeSimone said.\", \"For the past five years, he has been volunteering at the Next Generation Center, where he helps students achieve their high school equivalency diplomas. Since the start of the pandemic, Mr. DeSimone has been teaching his classes online.\", \"While helping to tutor students, Mr. DeSimone makes it a priority to talk to them about their future plans and encourages them to attend the center\\u2019s ceremonies for those who pass.\", \"\\u201cYou watch their faces, and especially the graduates, how proud they are of themselves,\\u201d Mr. DeSimone said. \\u201cThe graduations are wonderful. Getting the current students to sit in there and hear it just gets them more motivated.\\u201d\", \"After retiring from working in a data center, Edison Speck also became a volunteer, joining the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program at Community Service Society, another beneficiary of The Neediest Cases Fund.\", \"\\u201cIt gives me something useful to do, something to feel good about myself when I do it,\\u201d said Mr. Speck, 89. \\u201cThat\\u2019s worth a lot to me.\\u201d\", \"Over the past 26 years, Mr. Speck has worked on a variety of projects, most consistently as a benefits counselor through Community Service Society\\u2019s Advocacy, Counseling and Entitlement Services program. In that role, he helped patients at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx navigate public assistance programs.\", \"During the pandemic, Mr. Speck had to adjust to doing that work over the phone, which became so much of a challenge that he recently decided to take a break until he is able to volunteer again in person. Mr. Speck said that he misses working with his clients, and is counting down the days until he is able to work with them in person again.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s work that I enjoy doing,\\u201d Mr. Speck said, \\u201cand I really think that I benefit from it as much or more as the clients do.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"31f47608516711ecadedfdb587fce7bb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"31f47608516711ecadedfdb587fce7bb"}},
