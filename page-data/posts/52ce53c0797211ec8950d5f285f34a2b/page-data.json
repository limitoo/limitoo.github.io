nation's\\u00a0centre is expected to get a drenching in the coming days as tropical moisture makes its way south.\", \"Over the past few days the remnants of ex-tropical cyclone Tiffany have brought\\u00a0rain and storms to southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, falling on many of the upper-Darling catchments that have already seen flooding this year.\", \"But by tomorrow\\u00a0the rain in the east is largely\\u00a0expected to clear off and attention will turn back towards the centre, where the tropical antics will begin all over again.\\u00a0\", \"According to BOM senior meteorologist Jackson Browne,\\u00a0an upper-level system\\u00a0is set to cut off just over the Nullarbor\\u00a0Plain, triggering heavy rainfall to its east.\", \"\\\"So places like Ceduna, the Yorke Peninsula, Port Augusta will come under the influence of a fairly slow-moving system with the tropical moisture coming down from the Northern Territory,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"Four-day totals from Thursday through to midnight Sunday are expected to be from 60 to 100 millimetres, with higher falls in excess of 120mm if you end up under a thunderstorm.\\u00a0\", \"Mr Browne said some of the moisture would be yet more of the remnants of ex-cyclone Tiffany, the cyclone which continues to give, but there is also another inflow of moisture from the tropics in the mix this time around.\\u00a0\", \"The rain is expected to make it to Adelaide very roughly Saturday and into Sunday, and to Melbourne by Monday or Tuesday.\\u00a0\", \"But the rainfall is expected to weaken as it approaches the more populated areas.\\u00a0\", \"Ahead of the rain, a high-pressure ridge is expected to keep things dry but muggy in the south-east in the coming days.\\u00a0\", \"So it should be nice and dry for the tennis through to early next week.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Anything in it for Lake Eyre?\\u00a0</div>\", \"Even though rain is forecast for the Lake Eyre catchment, it would likely take more than is currently\\u00a0on the forecast to get the lake to fill.\", \"\\\"The initial losses in some of those catchments would be quite high\\u00a0because of there hasn't been a lot of rainfall,\\\" Mr Browne said.\", \"\\\"So there'll be a lot of seepage, a lot of evaporation before the rivers can get underway.\\\"\", \"But\\u00a0as\\u00a0Lake Eyre Yacht Club commodore Bob Backway\\u00a0points out, it is\\u00a0still\\u00a0early in the season.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We normally get our big rainfall from mid to late February and the season's been very good so far,\\\" he said..\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We've had three cyclones across the Australian coast so far this season\\u00a0which is pretty good.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"He said members of the yacht club were eternally optimistic.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How unusual is this rain?\\u00a0</div>\", \"There has been a lot of speculation over this rain event, but Mr Browne is not expecting it to be \\\"earth-shattering.\\\"\", \"How relatively significant this rainfall ends up being\\u00a0will depend upon where it falls.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's been tracking a bit more up the Nullarbor Plain, which means the rainfalls that will fall there are more significant, just given that it's traditionally a dry area,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"However, if the rain starts to fall closer to Adelaide, then it's not as significant.\\\"\", \"But South Australia is the driest state and Adelaide is the driest state capital.\", \"\\\"So any rainfall, especially the slow-moving nature of this rainfall, is notable for that part of the world,\\\" Mr Browne said.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Hot in the west\\u00a0</div>\", \"<img
