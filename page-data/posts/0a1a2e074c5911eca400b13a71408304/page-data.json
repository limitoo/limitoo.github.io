(Thanks to digital technology, it often isn\\u2019t.) If you aren\\u2019t cutting, how do you get rid of the dull bits?\", \"\\u201cBoiling Point,\\u201d written and directed by Philip Barantini, tells the story of a rising London chef\\u2019s worst night \\u2014 a night when his life is going to pieces as his restaurant is coming to ruin. We first see the chef, Andy Jones, on the phone, contending with one of the hoarier clich\\u00e9s of overworked men, that of having missed an important event in the development of one of his children.\", \"Worse awaits inside the eatery. Bigoted diners. Loud social media influencers. A celebrity chef and silent partner of Andy\\u2019s who has brought along a restaurant critic. Disgruntled employees. Oh, and a nut allergy.\", \"The ostensible point of the no-cutting ethos (and Hitchcock actually tried it, in \\u201cRope,\\u201d with mixed results) is to heighten realism. But here the ever-mobile camera imposes a kind of determinism. When it trails a restaurant worker taking out the trash, the viewer knows they\\u2019re not being removed from the central action just to observe labor \\u2014 there\\u2019s a plot point to be ticked.\", \"The actual drama is a hero\\u2019s journey that unpeels itself as an antihero\\u2019s journey, to indifferent effect. Stephen Graham, who plays Jones, is a fine actor (and the rest of the cast, especially Vinette Robinson as a particularly put-upon sous chef, is excellent). But for too much of the movie he\\u2019s called upon to wear a scowl that makes him look like a Wahlberg who\\u2019s swallowed a bad oyster.\"]","href_hash":"0a1a2e074c5911eca400b13a71408304"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0a1a2e074c5911eca400b13a71408304"}},
