A 21-gun salute rang out as the national anthem played. The red, yellow and navy blue royal flag was lowered \\u2014 exactly 55 years after the country gained independence from Britain.\", \"\\u201cToday, debate and discourse have become action,\\u201d Ms. Mason, 72, told the onlookers gathered in the capital, Bridgetown. \\u201cToday, we set our compass to a new direction.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Mason received a majority vote in Parliament in October to take on the role. In a speech afterward, Prime Minister Mia Mottley said: \\u201cWe believe that the time has come for us to claim our full destiny. It is a woman of the soil to whom this honor is being given.\\u201d\", \"The island nation, a democracy of about 300,000 people, announced in September that it would remove Queen Elizabeth as head of state, the latest Caribbean island to do so. It joined Guyana, which gained independence in 1966 and became a republic in 1970; Trinidad and Tobago, which became independent in 1962 and a republic in 1976; and Dominica, which gained full independence as a republic in 1978.\", \"Australia, Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea are among the nations that still call the queen their head of state.
