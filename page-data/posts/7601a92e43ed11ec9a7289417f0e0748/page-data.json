Republicans who break party ranks and defy former President Donald J. Trump have come to expect insults, invective and death threats \\u2014 often stoked by their own colleagues and conservative activists, who have denounced them as traitors.\", \"From congressional offices to community meeting rooms, threats of violence are becoming commonplace among a significant segment of the Republican Party. Ten months after rioters attacked the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, and after four years of a president who often spoke in violent terms about his adversaries, right-wing Republicans are talking more openly and frequently about the use of force as justifiable in opposition to those who dislodged him from power.\", \"In Washington, where decorum and civility are still given lip service, violent or threatening language still remains uncommon, if not unheard-of, among lawmakers who spend a great deal of time in the same building. But among the most fervent conservatives, who play an outsize role in primary contests and provide the party with its activist energy, the belief that the country is at a crossroads that could require armed confrontation is no longer limited to the fringe.\", \"Political violence has been part of the American story since the founding of the country, often entwined with racial politics and erupting in periods of great change. And elements of the left have contributed to the confrontational tenor of the country\\u2019s current politics, though Democratic leaders routinely condemn violence and violent imagery. But historians and those who study democracy say what has changed has been the embrace of violent speech by a sizable portion of one party, including some of its loudest voices inside government and most influential voices outside.\", \"In effect, they warn, the Republican Party is mainstreaming menace as a political tool.\", \"Omar Wasow, a political scientist at Pomona College who studies protests and race, drew a contrast between the current climate and earlier periods of turbulence and strife, like the 1960s or the run-up to the Civil War.\", \"\\u201cWhat\\u2019s different about almost all those other events is that now, there\\u2019s a partisan divide around the legitimacy of our political system,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe elite endorsement of political violence from factions of the Republican Party is distinct for me from what we saw in the 1960s. Then, you didn\\u2019t have \\u2014 from a president on down \\u2014 politicians calling citizens to engage in violent resistance.\\u201d\", \"From his earliest campaigning to the final moments of his presidency, Mr. Trump\\u2019s political image has incorporated the possibility of violence. He encouraged attendees at his rallies to \\u201cknock the hell\\u201d out of protesters, praised a lawmaker who body-slammed a reporter, and in a recent interview defended rioters who clamored to \\u201chang Mike Pence.\\u201d\", \"Yet even with the former president largely out of the public eye and after a deadly attack on the Capitol where rioters tried to overturn the presidential election, the Republican acceptance of violence has only spread. Polling indicates that 30 percent of Republicans, and 40 percent of people who \\u201cmost trust\\u201d far-right news sources, believe that \\u201ctrue patriots\\u201d may have to resort to violence to \\u201csave\\u201d the country \\u2014 a statement that gets far less support among Democrats and independents.\", \"Such views, routinely expressed in warlike or revolutionary terms, are often intertwined with white racial resentments and evangelical Christian religious fervor \\u2014 two potent sources of fuel for the G.O.P. during the Trump era \\u2014 as the most animated Republican voters increasingly see themselves as participants in a struggle, if not a kind of holy war, to preserve their idea of American culture and their place in society.\", \"Notably few Republican leaders have spoken out against violent language or behavior since Jan. 6, suggesting with their silent acquiescence that doing so would put them at odds with a significant share of their party\\u2019s voters. When the Idaho man asked about \\u201ckilling\\u201d political opponents at an event hosted by the conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Mr. Kirk said he must \\u201cdenounce\\u201d the question but went on to discuss at what point political violence could be justified.\", \"In that vacuum, the coarsening of Republican messaging has continued: Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, this week tweeted an anime video altered to show him killing Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and swinging two swords at Mr. Biden.\", \"Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at the left-leaning group New America who has studied political violence, said there was a connection between such actions and the growing view among Americans that politics is a struggle between enemies.\", \"\\u201cWhen you start dehumanizing political opponents, or really anybody, it becomes a lot easier to inflict violence on them,\\u201d Dr. Drutman said.\", \"\\u201cI have a hard time seeing how we have a peaceful 2024 election after everything that\\u2019s happened now,\\u201d he added. \\u201cI don\\u2019t see the rhetoric turning down, I don\\u2019t see the conflicts going away. I really do think it\\u2019s hard to see how it gets better before it gets worse.\\u201d\", \"Democrats are seeking Mr. Gosar\\u2019s censure, arguing that \\u201cdepictions of violence can foment actual violence and jeopardize the safety of elected officials.\\u201d\", \"The ranking G.O.P. lawmakers, Senator Mitch McConnell and Representative Kevin McCarthy, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Mr. McCarthy, who initially condemned the Jan. 6 attack and said \\u201cviolence is never a legitimate form of protest,\\u201d more recently has joked about hitting Nancy Pelosi in the head with a gavel if he were to replace her as speaker. Like nearly all of the members of his caucus, Mr. McCarthy has said nothing about Mr. Gosar\\u2019s video.\", \"For his part, Mr. Gosar suggested that critics were overly thin-skinned, insisting that the video was an allegory for a debate over immigration policy. He was slaying \\u201cthe policy monster of open borders,\\u201d not Ms. Ocasio-Cortez or Mr. Biden, his office said. \\u201cIt is a symbolic cartoon. It is not real life.\\u201d\", \"Carlos Curbelo, a Republican former congressman from Florida who is a critic of Mr. Trump, said Republicans needed to take a stronger approach against violent language and intimidation tactics.\", \"\\u201cI do think the problem is more acute among Republicans because there are a handful of Republican officials who have no limits,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYour country and your integrity should be more important to you than your re-election.\\u201d\", \"The increasing violence of Republican speech has been accompanied by a willingness of G.O.P. leaders to follow Mr. Trump\\u2019s lead and shrug off allegations of domestic violence that once would have been considered disqualifying for political candidates in either party.\", \"Herschel Walker, the former professional football player running for Senate in Georgia, is accused of repeatedly threatening his ex-wife\\u2019s life, but won Mr. Trump\\u2019s endorsement and appears to be consolidating party support behind his candidacy. Mr. Trump also backed the Ohio congressional campaign of Max Miller, who faces allegations of violence from his ex-girlfriend, the former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. Mr. Miller has sued Ms. Grisham for defamation.\", \"And Sean Parnell, a Senate candidate in Pennsylvania who was endorsed by Mr. Trump, appeared in court this week in a custody fight in which his estranged wife accuses him of choking her and physically harming their children. He denies it.\", \"Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, declined to repudiate Mr. Parnell. Asked on CNN whether Mr. Parnell was the right candidate for the job, he said, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll see who comes out of the primary.\\u201d\", \"There is little indication that the party has paid a political price for its increasingly violent tone.\", \"Even after corporations and donors vowed to withhold donations to the G.O.P. in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack, Republicans out-raised Democrats this year. And they outperformed expectations in the elections this month, capturing the Virginia governorship, winning a host of upset victories in suburban contests and making a surprisingly strong showing in New Jersey.\", \"Yet violent talk has tipped over into actual violence in ways big and small. School board members and public health officials have faced a wave of threats, prompting hundreds to leave their posts. A recent investigation by Reuters documented nearly 800 intimidating messages to election officials in 12 states.\", \"And threats against members of Congress have jumped by 107 percent compared with the same period in 2020, according to the Capitol Police. Lawmakers have been harassed at airports, targeted at their homes and had family members threatened. Some have spent tens of thousands on personal security.\", \"\\u201cYou don\\u2019t understand how awful it is and how scary it is until you\\u2019re in it,\\u201d said Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who praised a Republican colleague, Representative Fred Upton, for publicly sharing some of the threats he received after voting to approve the infrastructure bill. (Mr. Upton\\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.) \\u201cBut not telling people that this violence isn\\u2019t OK makes people think it is OK.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Dingell, who said she was threatened by men with assault weapons outside her home last year after she was denounced by Tucker Carlson on his Fox News show, shared a small sample of what she said were hundreds of profanity-laden threats she has received.\", \"\\u201cThey ought to try you for treason,\\u201d one caller screamed in a lengthy, graphic voice mail message. \\u201cI hope your family dies in front of you. I pray to God that if you\\u2019ve got any children, they die in your face.\\u201d\", \"Bradford Fitch, president of the Congressional Management Foundation, which advises lawmakers on issues like running their offices and communicating with constituents, said he now urged members not to hold open public meetings, an American tradition dating back to the colonies, because of security concerns. Politics, he said, had become \\u201ctoo raw and radioactive.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a good idea right now,\\u201d Mr. Fitch said. \\u201cI hope we can get to a point where we can advise members of Congress that it\\u2019s safe to have a town-hall meeting.\\u201d\", \"But even at right-wing gatherings of the like-minded, there is a shared assumption that political confrontation could escalate into violence.\", \"At a Virginia rally last month for conservative supporters of Glenn Youngkin, the Republican candidate for governor, the urgency of a call to arms was conveyed right from the opening prayer. The speaker warned of the looming threat of \\u201ccommunist atheists.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHeavenly Father, we come before you tonight,\\u201d said Joshua Pratt, a conservative activist. \\u201cYour children are in a battle, and we need your help.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"7601a92e43ed11ec9a7289417f0e0748"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7601a92e43ed11ec9a7289417f0e0748"}},
