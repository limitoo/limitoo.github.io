paying\\u00a0hundreds of dollars for\\u00a0COVID tests when entering the state.\", \"Queensland is just weeks away from reopening to people from interstate hotspots, with the state's borders set to open once 80 per cent of Queenslanders aged 16 and over are fully vaccinated.\", \"Based on the latest figures, that could be between December 6 and December 12.\", \"Under the state government's roadmap, all new arrivals must be double-vaccinated and have had a negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\\u00a0test within 72 hours before entering Queensland.\", \"PCR tests are only available at private pathology clinics and they cost about $150.\", \"This means a family of four travelling into Queensland over Christmas, for example, could be hit with a $600 bill.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Commonwealth should pay for tests, Deputy Premier says</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c6117512fa7777d5117a4f518d2a41e6\\\"

thought $600 was a deal-breaker for most families, Queensland's Deputy Premier\\u00a0Steven Miles said he made\\u00a0\\\"no apologies\\\" for keeping Queenslanders safe.\", \"\\\"The fact is \\u2013 being vaccinated and having a negative test will assist us to control the arrival of the virus into Queensland,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"This is a really important step, this is a really significant easing of restrictions.\\\"\", \"Tests are free for people with COVID-19 symptoms, however Medicare rebates are not payable for tests conducted for domestic or international travel purposes.\", \"Mr Miles said all tests should be covered under Medicare.\", \"\\\"The reason that those tests can't be provided free of charge is because Medicare requires that for a rebate, that tests need to be medically necessary,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"I'd urge the Commonwealth to consider that these tests are part of our wider health response, and so therefore should be eligible for a Medicare rebate.\\\"\", \"A spokesperson for federal Health Minister\\u00a0Greg Hunt said Queensland was \\\"walking away\\\" from its responsibilities to pay for pathology.\", \"\\\"As per the agreement at National Cabinet, COVID-19 testing for asymptomatic individuals (including to travel domestically within Australia) is a shared responsibility of the Australian Government and state and territory governments,\\\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\", \"\\\"The National Partnership on COVID-19 Response, which all government have signed, includes a 50 per cent\\u00a0funding contribution from the Australian government towards COVID-19 testing.\", \"\\\"The Commonwealth funds 100 per cent\\u00a0of Medicare funded tests and 50 per cent\\u00a0of state-based tests.\", \"\\\"It is surprise that Queensland is seeking to walk away from their responsibilities and their own decision, reducing their own expenditure on COVID safety.\", \"\\\"The Commonwealth has spent over $1.87 billion on pathology testing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we would welcome Queensland announcing their investment into pathology.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Government 'actively considering' changes to test requirement</div>\", \"Acting Chief Health Officer Peter Aitken said the Queensland government was considering scrapping the testing requirement or making tests free.\", \"\\\"We're working through the detail \\u2026 we recognise [there will be] enormous challenges for people,\\\" Dr Aitken said.\", \"\\\"We're looking at it, there may be no tests, there may be a free test, we don't know at the moment.\", \"\\\"We're talking to New South Wales, we're talking to other colleagues and we'll let you know when there's a decision.\", \"\\\"For people who are getting tested where there's no symptoms, there are different arrangements for different states, and the Commonwealth and different pathology providers do determine some of those costs. That's something we have to work through,\\\" he said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Special arrangements\\u00a0possible for border communities</div>\", \"The New South Wales Cross-Border Commissioner is calling on the Queensland government to spare residents in the border zone the hundreds of dollars they'll need to pay for COVID-19 tests every week\\u00a0just to cross the border for work.\", \"Dr Aitken said there would be fewer testing requirements for fully vaccinated Queenslanders entering the border zone and for NSW border bubble residents entering Queensland for non-essential purposes.\", \"\\\"That's one of the things we're looking at,\\\" he confirmed.\", \"\\\"As we reach the 80 per cent [full vaccination mark] \\u2026 the requirements for those people who live in the border zone and the requirements for testing, it's something we're looking at actively.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Rapid antigen tests could be used in the future</div>\", \"A Queensland Health spokesperson said rapid antigen tests could be accepted as an alternative to PCR tests sometime in the future.\", \"Rapid antigen tests are much faster and easier to carry out but are not as sensitive as PCR tests.\", \"\\\"PCR tests will continue to be the preferred method of testing,\\\" the spokesperson said.\", \"\\\"[They are] efficient, reliable and accurate \\u2026 and can be turned around on the same day, depending on the volume of testing being performed.\", \"\\\"Rapid antigen tests for specific cohorts and specific testing situations may be considered into the future.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"1b8384a048fb11eca1be39810c384683"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1b8384a048fb11eca1be39810c384683"}},
