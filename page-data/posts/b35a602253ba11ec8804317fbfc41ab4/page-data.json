Drew Michael harnesses a lot of current comedy trends \\u2014 commentary on the form itself, frankness about psychotherapy, material read off a phone, risqu\\u00e9 jokes that are immediately re-metabolized \\u2014 but because his analysis is gutsier and sharper than other comedians\\u2019, this feels new and surprising. Michael bobs between rage and introspection, and his closing riff knocked my socks off. If you watch a lot of stand-up and want something that feels like leveling up, watch this.\", \"\\u2018Enlisted\\u2019When to watch: Now, on Hulu.\", \"This darling comedy ran for one scanty season way back in 2014 and has now at long last made it to a mainstream streaming platform. Parker Young, Geoff Stults and Chris Lowell star as brothers serving together on a second-string Army base in Florida, an assignment for soldiers who are not really battle-ready. Randy (Young), the Woody Boyd of the trio, is perhaps too tender for a real deployment; he weeps trying to describe even just the first few seconds of a Pixar movie. \\u201cThat lamp doesn\\u2019t have a family!\\u201d he sobs. \\u201cEnlisted\\u201d is sunny and earnest, and it\\u2019s packed with jokes. If you miss the ensemble energy of \\u201cHappy Endings\\u201d or \\u201cNew Girl,\\u201d or if you can\\u2019t wait for \\u201cTed Lasso\\u201d to come back, watch this.\", \"Because we live in a fallen world, Hulu has replicated Fox\\u2019s misdeeds and has the episodes out of order; follow this order for maximum enjoyment and minimum confusion.\", \"\\u2018Stath Lets Flats\\u2019When to watch: Season 3 arrives Friday, on HBO Max.\", \"Usually, cringe-y comedy makes me pray for the earth to open and swallow me into its velvet oblivion, but there\\u2019s so much else going on with \\u201cStath Lets Flats\\u201d that its intense moments of cringe seem much more tolerable, and occasionally even pleasurable. Jamie Demetriou created and stars in the show as Stath, a dingus real estate agent who makes unusual word choices and has a distinctive perspective on the world. Like characters in both versions of \\u201cThe Office\\u201d or in \\u201cPeep Show,\\u201d Stath is stunted and oblivious, but the show has a less judgmental, more celebratory vibe than its brethren.\"]","href_hash":"b35a602253ba11ec8804317fbfc41ab4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b35a602253ba11ec8804317fbfc41ab4"}},
