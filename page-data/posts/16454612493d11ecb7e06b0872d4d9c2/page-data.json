Investors alleged that brokerage firms like Robinhood conspired with clearinghouses and the market maker Citadel Securities to restrict trading of meme stocks as they shot up in price. The judge found otherwise.\", \"\\u201cA bare assertion of conspiracy will not suffice,\\u201d Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida wrote in the order dismissing the antitrust-based claim. Executives at Robinhood and Citadel Securities \\u201cexchanged various vague and ambiguous emails\\u201d around the time of meme-stock trading halts, the judge noted, which looked \\u201csomewhat suspicious given the participants and their timing.\\u201d\", \"But claims of conspiracy were not \\u201cplausible,\\u201d the judge wrote. The firms had a \\u201clawful, ongoing business relationship,\\u201d in which Robinhood routes customer trades to Citadel Securities to execute and gets paid for the order flow, a common but sometimes contentious arrangement.\", \"The case isn\\u2019t closed. There are two more tranches in this litigation, which combined claims from across the country. Retail traders are also claiming Robinhood was negligent in its duty to customers and violated securities laws.\", \"Maurice Pessah, the lead lawyer on the negligence tranche, told the DealBook newsletter that his case is based on \\u201ctotally separate and distinct legal theories.\\u201d Robinhood has moved to dismiss the claims; there could be a decision by the end of the year.\"]","href_hash":"16454612493d11ecb7e06b0872d4d9c2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"16454612493d11ecb7e06b0872d4d9c2"}},
