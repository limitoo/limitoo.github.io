It honestly made my heart skip a beat,\\\" the person who posted the image said.\", \"\\\"It's awfully disrespectful towards people who have actually suffered. It totally goes over some people's heads their incredible privilege to not only have access to a vaccine, but also to turn it down if they wish,\\\" one user says.\", \"\\\"The owners of Q Foods don't know how lucky they are to live in a country where they can hold this attitude and not experience any consequences for it,\\\" another user says. \\\"They're unlikely to get sick because of the diligence of the people around them, and they're unlikely to get a brick through their window because of the kindness and tolerance of the people around them.
