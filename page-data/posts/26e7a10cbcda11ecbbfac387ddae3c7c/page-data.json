But some investors view the offer with skepticism.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-04-15T08:39:12.000Z","content":"[\"Mercurial billionaire Elon Musk now says he wants to buy Twitter outright, taking it private to restore its commitment to what he terms \\\"free speech.\\\" But his $43 billion offer, which appeared to fall flat with investors on Thursday, raises as many questions as it answers.\", \"Among them: Is he serious? Can he get the money together? Would a sale make shareholders happy? And what would the social platform look like if he succeeds?\", \"Twitter said its board \\\"will carefully review the proposal.\\\" But one major investor has already come out against the offer. Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, whom Bloomberg News reports controls more than 4% of Twitter, said on Thursday that \\\"I reject\\\" the offer.\\u00a0\", \"I don't believe that the proposed offer by @elonmusk ($54.20) comes close to the intrinsic value of @Twitter given its growth prospects. \", \"Being one of the largest & long-term shareholders of Twitter, @Kingdom_KHC & I reject this offer.https://t.co/Jty05oJUTk pic.twitter.com/XpNHUAL6UX\", \"\\\"I don't believe that the proposed offer by\\u00a0@elonmusk\\u00a0($54.20) comes close to the intrinsic value of\\u00a0@Twitter\\u00a0given its growth prospects,\\\" Alwaleed wrote on Twitter.\", \"Ostensibly because the service, he says, isn't living up to its potential as a \\\"platform for free speech.\\\" Musk insists that he's not interested in making money off Twitter and on Thursday said his motivation sprang from the realization that \\\"having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.\\\"\", \"Twitter, like other social media platforms, suspends accounts for violating content standards, including on violence, hate speech or harmful misinformation. Its suspension of former President Donald Trump angered his followers.\", \"Musk has described himself as a \\\"free speech absolutist\\\" \\u2014 but he has blocked Twitter users who question or disagree with him. Regulators have also accused his car company, Tesla, of retaliating against Black workers who spoke up about discrimination.\", \"Musk calls himself a \\\"free speech absolutist.\\\" He says Trump shouldn't be kicked off Twitter because tech companies shouldn't be the \\\"arbiter of free speech.\\\"\", \"Yet he routinely silences critics -- both on Twitter and in the Tesla workplace.\", \"No. And his regulatory filing says the offer is subject to \\\"completion of anticipated financing.\\\"\", \"During a Thursday on-stage interview at the TED 2022 conference, Musk noted vaguely that he has \\\"sufficient assets\\\" to complete the deal, adding: \\\"I can do it if possible.\\\"\", \"Typically, people or companies that offer to buy other businesses come with financing lined up, either in the form of cash, stock or debt. But his offer letter didn't include details about how he would arrange the financing.\", \"Musk is the world's wealthiest man, according to Forbes, with a nearly $265 billion fortune. But much of his money is tied up in Tesla stock \\u2014 he owns about 17% of the company, according to FactSet, which is valued at more than $1 trillion \\u2014 and SpaceX, his privately held space company. It's unclear how much cash Musk has.\", \"\\\"I do think this will be somewhat painful and I'm not sure that I will actually be able to acquire it,\\\" Musk said in his Thursday interview.\", \"Musk could sell Tesla stock to raise money \\u2014 which could hurt Tesla's share price \\u2014 or borrow against his stock holdings. But Forbes notes that he has already used more than half of his Tesla stake as loan collateral.\", \"The stock traded lower than the offer price of $54.20 a share Thursday, closing at $45.08, suggesting investors doubt the deal will go through. The markets are closed on Friday in observance of Good Friday.\", \"The shares have traded above $70 in the past 12 months and peaked at $80.75 in February 2021.\", \"There has been executive turnover since co-founder Jack Dorsey's departure in November left Twitter with a new CEO, Parag Agrawal, whose initial actions have involved internal reorganizations. There have not been any major changes to Twitter to date. \", \"Despite its outsized influence due to high-profile celebrity and politician posters, as well as a devoted base of journalists, Twitter has fewer users than social media rivals like Facebook and TikTok. Musk himself is a huge user, with more than 81 million followers.\", \"Dorsey, still a major shareholder, has not indicated what he thinks of Musk's offer. As mentioned above, Alwaleed of Saudi Arabia has come out against the bid.\", \"Twitter said only that it will look at the offer. Media reports have said that the board is considering a defense against a hostile takeover, known as a \\\"poison pill.\\\" A spokesperson declined to answer if the board was weighing such a move.\", \"It's hard to know with Musk, and even trying to game out this hypothetical might be taking the man too seriously. By saying Twitter is not living up to its potential to be a \\\"platform for free speech,\\\" he seems to be saying he would scale back content moderation.\\u00a0\", \"But he has also called for the company to crack down on spam accounts, which implies more moderation.\", \"He proposed dropping ads from the service \\u2014 ads are how Twitter makes money \\u2014 and making its San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter. He also seems to approve of a button to edit tweets.\", \"Social-media companies struggle to contain misinformation and hate speech. Musk, whose tweets can lead online bullies to swarm his critics online, does not seem keen on content moderation.\", \"\\\"Regulators worldwide will be wincing at the potential free speech implications should Musk's takeover bid succeed,\\\" said GlobalData analyst Rachel Foster-Jones. \\\"Musk is clearly serious about promoting free speech for the benefit of democracy, but the line between free speech and hate speech or misinformation is becoming increasingly muddied, and attempts to change Twitter could easily lead to these issues spiraling out of control.\\\"\", \"In his talk with Anderson, Musk said that Twitter is \\\"bound by the laws of the country it operates in, so obviously there are some limitations on free speech in the U.S. and of course Twitter would have to abide by those rules.\\\" But he said it was \\\"quite dangerous\\\" to have \\\"tweets be mysteriously promoted and demoted\\\" and having a \\\"black-box algorithm.\\\"\", \"Twitter may hire bankers and advisers to help it review the deal, said Third Bridge technology, media and telecom analyst Scott Kessler. And other buyers could emerge: \\\"It seems that if would-be strategic and/or financial buyers are interested in Twitter, they should probably engage now.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"26e7a10cbcda11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"26e7a10cbcda11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
