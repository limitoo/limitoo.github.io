Containers set to be moved by truck will be allowed to stick around for nine days before the charges start accruing, while the ones set to be moved by rail will have three.\", \"Fines for the companies will begin at a rate of $100 per container per day spent past the limit.

On October 19, 100 ships were anchored while they waited to enter one of the ports, the most in history. This broke the all-time record of 97 ships, which was set in September.
