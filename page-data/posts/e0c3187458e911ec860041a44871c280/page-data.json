That would be James Lazor of the Wolves. One of the TV sportscasters hyping the game announces, \\u201cMonday night is about etching his name in the history books.\\u201d\", \"His star quarterback, LeMarcus James, has other plans. Along with his best friend, a lesser player named Emmett Sunday, James is going on strike. Referring to his fellow college athletes, James says in one televised statement, \\u201cOver 12,000 of us participate in a multibillion-dollar business that doesn\\u2019t even give us health insurance.\\u201d\", \"Written by Adam Mervis and directed by Ric Roman Waugh, \\u201cNational Champions\\u201d is a drama whose timeliness has only been slightly compromised by the N.C.A.A.\\u2019s recent interim policy allowing athletes to earn revenue via endorsement deals. To go by this fictional movie\\u2019s argumentation, that real-life shift only slightly changes the overall picture for college athletes.\", \"Coach Lazor is played by J.K. Simmons, but his character here is no \\u201cWhiplash\\u201d-style martinet. He\\u2019s ostensibly compassionate, and says he sees LeMarcus as a son. But, unsurprisingly, the coach\\u2019s patriarchal stance is later shown to be part of the problem.\", \"The movie wants to make its points on class and race hotly. LeMarcus, appealingly played by Stephan James, is Black, and then again so is Katherine Poe (a simultaneously imposing and enigmatic Uzo Aduba), the ruthless lawyer the N.C.A.A. has put on a mission to destroy and discredit the quarterback. The vicious machinations echo an adage popularized by Jenny Holzer: \\u201cAbuse of power comes as no surprise.\\u201d But the movie dilutes its impact with lackluster direction of samey scenes \\u2014 people in hotel rooms speechifying \\u2014 and a distracting nighttime soap subplot.\"]","href_hash":"e0c3187458e911ec860041a44871c280"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e0c3187458e911ec860041a44871c280"}},
