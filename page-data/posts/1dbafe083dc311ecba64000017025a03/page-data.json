The World Health Organization is opposed only to the latter.\", \"Hong Kong officials said that the campaign would prioritize the city\\u2019s high-risk population at a time when its vaccination rate lags that of many other developed economies, with about 66 percent of the population fully inoculated, according to government data released on Wednesday.\", \"The move comes as Hong Kong works to encourage China to restore quarantine-free travel from the city to the mainland. Since the start of the pandemic, Hong Kong, like Beijing, has enforced stringent border restrictions that have hurt businesses and left many travelers frustrated. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\\u2019s chief executive, has said that restoring quarantine-free travel between Hong Kong and the rest of China is her \\u201ctop priority\\u201d; currently, only those traveling from the mainland to Hong Kong are exempt from quarantine.\", \"Hong Kong\\u2019s decision to give extra shots to high-risk residents follows similar efforts in recent weeks in many provinces on the mainland, and appears to be part of a broader strategy to align closely with China\\u2019s \\u201cCovid zero\\u201d policy. Ms. Lam said last week that the city would strengthen its quarantine requirements and eliminate most exemptions from the mandatory, self-funded quarantine periods, which can be up to 21 days. \", \"Caseloads in Hong Kong have remained low in recent months: the city recorded two daily new cases on average in the past 14 days, according to a Johns Hopkins University data set.\", \"Other categories of people will be eligible for an additional shot six months after their second dose, the authorities added. They include those who have received the Sinovac vaccine, people ages 60 and over, health workers, patients with chronic illnesses and people working in certain occupations with a high risk of infection.\"]","href_hash":"1dbafe083dc311ecba64000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1dbafe083dc311ecba64000017025a03"}},
