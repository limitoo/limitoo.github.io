parliament, as protests over the controversial new bill continue.\", \"In a bill which has already passed through the state's Lower House, the state's premier would be able to place Victoria under a state of pandemic for three months at a time with no maximum time period.\", \"The health minister would be able to make wide-ranging and enforceable pandemic orders they believed were\\u00a0reasonably necessary to protect public health.\", \"This would be a shift from the current laws, where the chief health officer of the day is responsible for signing off on public health orders.\", \"That change has been welcomed by many observers as a move that delivers more accountability, along with changes to protect QR code data from being used by police, concessional fines for vulnerable Victorians and the creation of an independent pandemic management advisory committee.\", \"When the bill was introduced, the government said the powers created were not dissimilar to other jurisdictions such as NSW and New Zealand, and Health Minister Martin Foley said it would make an \\\"even more transparent and accountable system\\\" to manage future pandemics.\", \"But in its submission to the government on the laws published on Tuesday, the Victorian Bar called on the government to delay the introduction of the Public Health and Wellbeing (Pandemic Management) Bill 2021 to the Upper House so it could consider a range of concerns.\", \"The professional association for more than 2,200 Victorian barristers sounded its concern over the \\\"extraordinarily broad\\\" powers granted to the minister and the lack of an overall time limit on the pandemic declarations.\", \"Its formal submission has come a couple of weeks after its president Christopher Blanden QC accused the government of seeking to legislate \\\"extreme\\\" powers which would have pleased the totalitarian Stasi regime of East Germany.\", \"It is calling for the bill to be amended so that the minister's pandemic orders are limited to specific actions such as restricting movement or mandating the wearing of protective equipment.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Bar urges government to rein in time limits, breadth of powers</div>\", \"The group has also taken aim at the \\\"breathtakingly broad\\\" powers the bill bestows on authorised officers, \\\"a class of person that can include numerous low level public officials\\\", calling for a more details and prescriptive outlining of their powers instead.\", \"It also wants the bill amended to make clear that any powers exercised through the bill are deemed invalid if they breach the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities.\", \"In addition, the association said while there may be legitimate public health reasons to discriminate based on attributes\\u00a0\\\"such as age, gender, disability or pregnancy\\\", other attributes should be explicitly excluded from the bill through an amendment.\", \"\\\"The Victorian Bar is particularly concerned about the inclusion of an express power to make pandemic orders that apply to a person by reference to their political belief, industrial activity or personal association with others,\\\" the group said.\", \"Under the bill, the government must publish the chief health officer's advice, a statement of reasons and justifications on any pandemic orders within 14 days of it being made.\", \"But the Victorian Bar said that timeframe should be shorter.\", \"\\\"Experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that public health directions change frequently and unexpectedly,\\\" the group said.\", \"\\\"There is no reason why the reasons behind rapid changes should lag 14 days behind the changes themselves.\", \"\\\"A 14-day delay in accessing the Minister's reasons hampers the ability to access efficient and effective judicial review.\\\"\", \"On Tuesday evening, around a hundred protesters gathered outside Parliament House chanting \\\"kill the bill\\\", \\\"sack Dan Andrews\\\" and \\\"free Victoria\\\".\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/247ac8cfb193b1985758592b275f76bf\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div
