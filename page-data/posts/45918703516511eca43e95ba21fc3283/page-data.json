state, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) says.\", \"Forecaster Helen Reid said the BOM would be examining records with a fine-tooth comb over the next few days.\", \"\\\"It's looking like there's a couple of places that have even had over 100 years of records, in the Wide Bay Burnett region that are going to be able to break a record or two,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Further west towards Charleville, that might be another option through there \\u2014 and Bundaberg as well.\\\"\", \"While the rain had not been quite that impressive in the state's south-east, Ms Reid said heavy falls could be on the way today.\", \"\\\"I know there was a couple of locations through there that are not quite record-breaking candidates but by the time we get through [today] they may well be on the list as well.\\\"\", \"Much of the state can expect showers and thunderstorms until tomorrow, with some isolated wet weather in eastern regions later in the week.\", \"Those showers and thunderstorms will extend to more of the state into the weekend, with no clear indication as to when the wet weather will clear.\", \"A man had to be rescued this morning after he drove his truck into floodwater on the Cunningham Highway near Goondiwindi.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Authorities watching river levels closely</div>\", \"Minor, moderate, and major flood warnings are in place for a number of rivers across Queensland.\", \"Rivers in eastern and southern areas not currently affected by flood warnings are on flood watch.\", \"The arrival of rain across the central Queensland inland has been welcome news for Claremont grazier Dyan Hughes, who said recent falls at her property had \\\"definitely\\\" broken November records.\", \"\\\"We had 70 millimetres the day before [yesterday] but our farming neighbours had 150 and 190mm and all that rain goes into the creek, our main creek, that flows through here and ends up in the Burdekin, so we had a lot of dams filling and overfilling.\\\"\",

country near Clermont in central Queensland after recent rain.(Facebook: Wentworth Cattle)</div>\", \"Ms Hughes said it had been a \\\"phenomenal year\\\" after so many years of struggle.\", \"\\\"We're so grateful, we've had 40 years on this place and [in] 2019 we only got 8 inches for the year, and I called it in our rainfall book 'a bugger of a year', and I summarised 2020 as a worrisome year, and this will have to go down as an awesome year,\\\" she said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'You never say no to rain'</div>\", \"At her cattle property about 115 kilometres west of Rockhampton, grazier Olive Smith has seen a good soaking.\", \"\\\"We had 228mm on Sunday, lunch time it was sort of from around 10 to 12 to around half past two,\\\" she said.\", \"<img

months ago that all those paddocks in front of our place were just bare and we were taking out feed and feeding cows and calves, and everything on the place had to get fed and you could see every stone and rock and ant nest.\", \"\\\"Then you go from that and now you look and it's bright green grass and you think, 'Woohoo!'\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">SES urges acting to minimise flood
