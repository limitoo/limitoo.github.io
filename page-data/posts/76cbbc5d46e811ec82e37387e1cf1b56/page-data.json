But the government has only belatedly issued the full document, the third such summation of history in the 100 years of the Chinese Communist Party. Scholars, investors and government analysts will parse the resolution for what it reveals about Mr. Xi\\u2019s worldview and intentions. Here are some initial takeaways.\", \"The implications of the Chinese Communist Party\\u2019s jargon-riddled speeches and documents can sometimes be elusive. Not this time.\", \"A chorus of official speeches and editorials has emphasized that the resolution had one main goal: to cement Mr. Xi\\u2019s status as a transformational leader essential to ensuring China\\u2019s rise.\", \"Roughly two-thirds of the document is devoted to Mr. Xi\\u2019s nine years in power and the changes he has brought in politics, economics, foreign policy and other areas. Mr. Xi\\u2019s name appears 22 times in the resolution; Mao Zedong gets 18 mentions, and Deng Xiaoping six. Mr. Xi\\u2019s immediate predecessor, Hu Jintao \\u2014 in power for a decade \\u2014 receives one mention.\", \"As is the way in Chinese politics, the elevation of Mr. Xi already has its own slogan embedded in the resolution: \\u201cThe two establishments\\u201d (\\u201cLiang ge queli\\u201d) \\u2014 that is, establishing Mr. Xi as China\\u2019s \\u201ccore\\u201d leader and establishing his ideas as China\\u2019s bedrock official doctrine. Party cadres have repeated that slogan in speech after speech since the Central Committee approved the move last week.\", \"Officials must show \\u201cabsolute loyalty to the core, resolutely defend the core, closely and constantly follow the core,\\u201d said the official account of a meeting about the resolution in Shandong Province, eastern China.\", \"Mr. Xi was already powerful before the history resolution, but the document appears intended to propel him into a new phase of influence before a Communist Party congress next year. That congress is likely to give Mr. Xi a third five-year term as party leader, breaking with the two-term pattern that emerged under his predecessors. It will also add political urgency to his policy priorities, including a \\u201ccommon prosperity\\u201d program intended to rein in economic inequality, as well as efforts to strengthen China\\u2019s homegrown technological capabilities.\", \"The history resolution sets him in the party\\u2019s firmament of epoch-defining leaders, alongside Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Mao led China to stand up against oppression; Deng led it to prosperity; and now Mr. Xi is leading it to strength \\u2014 so goes the three-stage description of China\\u2019s rise repeated in the resolution.\", \"Assessing Deng\\u2019s legacy presented Mr. Xi with a tricky issue: If Deng and his handpicked successors \\u2014 Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao \\u2014 were so successful, what justified the sharp shift to more centralized, authoritarian control that Mr. Xi has overseen? On the other hand, Mr. Xi\\u2019s claims to be an economic reformer could suffer if he denigrated Deng, who is still widely revered in China.\", \"The resolution praises the Deng era for unleashing China\\u2019s economic growth, and also defends Deng\\u2019s decision to use armed force to crush pro-democracy protests that spread across China in 1989. \\u201cReform and opening up was a crucial step in determining the fate of contemporary China,\\u201d it says.\", \"Yet the resolution also bluntly argues that problems had piled up before 2012, when Mr. Xi came to power: corruption, political ill-discipline and lack of faith in the party, as well as wider problems such as industrial pollution and inefficient growth. His immediate predecessors, it suggests, had let things drift.\", \"\\u201cThe external environment was bringing many new dangers and challenges,\\u201d the resolution says of the time before Mr. Xi took office. Inside the Communist Party, it adds, corruption was spreading. \\u201cSome party members and officials experienced grave crises in their political faith.\\u201d\", \"Confronting Mao\\u2019s legacy also presented potential pitfalls. Under Mr. Xi, the party has stepped up censorship to defend Mao from criticism. The authorities have curtailed research and teaching on the disastrous decades of Mao\\u2019s rule. But going too far in defending Mao could be risky, too.\", \"Mr. Xi has faced criticism that his hard-line campaigns against political disloyalty risk reviving parts of China\\u2019s Maoist past. Mr. Xi has not shown interest in unleashing turbulent Mao-like mass campaigns, so he has tried to acknowledge Mao\\u2019s excesses while strongly defending Mao\\u2019s overall record.\", \"The resolution praises Mao as the founder of the People\\u2019s Republic and credits him with creating a new China, free of foreign imperialism. It devotes just one broadly phrased paragraph to summing up the worst calamities of Mao\\u2019s era, including the Great Leap Forward, the attempt to drive China toward Communism that ended in mass famine, and the Cultural Revolution, when fighting and purges convulsed the country.\", \"\\u201cAlthough there were severe setbacks during the course of exploration\\u201d under Mao, the resolution says, China scored \\u201cmassive achievements.\\u201d\", \"The resolution shows no hints of Mr. Xi\\u2019s acknowledging any missteps in his own nine years in power. On the contrary, much of the resolution describes his successes in stamping out corruption, reducing poverty and eliminating political opposition to Communist Party rule in mainland China, as well as in Hong Kong.\", \"Before Mr. Xi took office, the resolution says, China\\u2019s \\u201ccapacity to safeguard its national security was lacking.\\u201d\", \"Nor does the resolution nod to any of the criticisms made by foreign politicians that China\\u2019s hectoring, heavy-handed diplomacy has needlessly riled other countries. The resolution says that Mr. Xi has expanded China\\u2019s international circle of friends and influence. But it warns that the party needs to remain tough to cope with dangers ahead.\", \"\\u201cConstant retreat will only bring bullying from those who grab a yard if you give an inch,\\u201d says the resolution. \\u201cMaking concessions to get our way will only draw us into more humiliating straits.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"76cbbc5d46e811ec82e37387e1cf1b56"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"76cbbc5d46e811ec82e37387e1cf1b56"}},
