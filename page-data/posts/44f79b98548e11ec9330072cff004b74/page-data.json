Bundy was ordered to pay more than $1,000 in fines and complete 40 hours of public service in a commuted sentence after being convicted in July of misdemeanor trespassing and resisting or obstructing officers at the state Capitol.\", \"Aaron Welling, Bundy's campaign treasurer, wrote in a letter to Ada County's 4th District Court late in November that the gubernatorial hopeful has \\\"completed 1,621 hours of public service.\\\" The letter mentioned what appeared to be campaign trail activities, encouraging voter registration and helping people to \\\"become more active in holding public officials accountable.\\\"\", \"When the Idaho Press-Tribune asked Welling whether the activities he cited were from his campaign or community service, the treasurer responded that \\\"It is what it is. If the courts don't like it, the courts don't like it.\\\"\", \"Idaho's criminal code stipulates that sentencing after conviction \\\"may include the rendering of labor and services to charities, governmental agencies, needy citizens and nonprofit organizations,\\\" the AP reported.\", \"Bundy is part of a large group of Republican primary candidates seeking Idaho's gubernatorial office. Republican Governor Brad Little has not announced another campaign but is expected to seek re-election, though former President Donald Trump has given his endorsement to Lieutenant Governor Janice McGeachin, according to the AP.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945371/far-right-activist-ammon-bundy.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Anti-government activist Ammon Bundy says the hours he spent campaigning to be the next governor of Idaho should count toward his community service requirement following his conviction of obstructing police during his arrest for trespassing at the state Capitol.

Officers said Bundy also went limp and refused to stand and put his hands behind his back. Officers ultimately wheeled Bundy out of the Capitol building on a swivel chair.\", \"The arrest came during a special session of the Idaho Legislature called for lawmakers to address issues related to the coronavirus pandemic.\", \"Bundy was among dozens of demonstrators\\u2014many of them members of his \\\"People's Rights\\\" organization\\u2014who attended the special session to protest because they were angry about coronavirus-related restrictions. During one protest, unmasked demonstrators joined by Bundy forced their way into a House gallery with limited seating, shattering a glass door.\", \"Bundy's arrest came the next day in an auditorium used for lawmakers considering a measure on coronavirus-related liability. The meeting was halted and switched to another room after more than 100 protesters shouted down the lawmakers. Most attendees then left, but Bundy and others decided to stay even after officers told them the room was closed to the public.\", \"In the 2016 Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation, Bundy and others were eventually arrested, ending the 41-day occupation. An Oregon jury later acquitted Bundy of all federal charges in that case.\", \"In 2014, Bundy, several of his brothers and his father led an armed standoff in Nevada with Bureau of Land Management agents who tried to confiscate his father's cattle for grazing on public land without a permit.
