country enters the next phase of the pandemic.\", \"The warning comes despite more than 80 per cent of people aged 16 and over being fully vaccinated with two doses.\", \"Experts have warned being fully vaccinated\\u00a0may not be good enough next year as iterations of the virus inevitably emerge and some freedoms, such as entry into certain countries may require proof of additional doses.\", \"Here's what you need to know about getting a booster shot.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What is a booster shot?</div>\", \"Anyone who has had two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine is considered fully vaccinated in Australia.\", \"A booster shot is effectively another dose of a vaccine, but it does not add extra\\u00a0protection, rather it\\u00a0replenishes\\u00a0the immunity profile which will naturally wane over time.\", \"This isn't a novel concept, booster shots for tetanus or whooping cough are administered regularly.\", \"Regardless of which vaccine you've received, such as Pfizer or AstraZeneca, having both doses will significantly reduce your chance to contract, spread or fall seriously ill from the virus.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Why is it important to get a booster shot?</div>\", \"The antibodies your body produces will decline over time, according to epidemiologist\\u00a0Marylouise McLaws.\", \"\\\"From the time you've had your second dose your immune system responds really well and you're at the top of your immune response level,\\\" Professor McLaws said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/4e3a13136695ed583265851355c10f71\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Epidemiologist Marylouise McLaws said booster shot data from countries like Israel was so far encouraging.(AAP: Mick Tsikas)</div>\", \"She said early research showed a booster shot would be required at about the sixth-month mark \\u2014 sooner depending on which vaccine you've taken.\", \"Because\\u00a0AstraZeneca has a lower overall effectiveness than Pfizer (about a 15 per cent difference), the recommended time for a booster shot would come earlier for the former.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Am I eligible\\u00a0to get a booster shot?</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ec90bcbe869e386430c419e3c311781c\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Pfizer is the primary recommended dose for booster shots.(ABC News: Haidarr Jones)</div>\", \"The first priority for booster shots will be in residential aged care facilities, which have accounted for a significant proportion of COVID deaths in Australia.\", \"Other priority rollout areas for the federal government include disability care and frontline health workers where infection risks were elevated.\", \"Pfizer will be the primary vaccine recommendation for booster shots, unless there are medical reasons to use another type such as Moderna.\", \"Unlike the beginning of the year there isn't a struggle, or competition between states and territories\\u00a0for vaccine supplies.\", \"Last week, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the state was \\\"awash\\\" with Pfizer vaccines and even indicated there was a risk large swathes of the stock could expire if not administered.\", \"It's recommended you\\u00a0check your\\u00a0state's own booster shot program.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Are booster shots mandatory?</div>\", \"Booster shots are not mandatory\\u00a0anywhere in the world but Professor McLaws foresees countries imposing travel restrictions on people without booster shots.\", \"\\\"I can see that it will happen, absolutely,\\\" she said.\", \"She pointed to the successful administration of booster shots for the elderly in Israel and said as data from booster programs continued to\\u00a0emerge, particularly from the US, it would\\u00a0likely change the framework for COVID responses.\", \"\\\"They'll start rolling it out and when they start seeing the impact on reducing infection transmission that will become part of a travel requirements,\\\" she said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Will I only need a third dose?</div>\", \"<img

off-limits for those without booster shots.(AAP: Dan Himbrechts\\u00a0)</div>\", \"Health authorities have not indicated booster shot programs beyond the third dose, but NSW Health said it's still early days.\", \"\\\"Experts all over the world are tracking and researching the COVID-19 virus to better understand how long the vaccines will provide protection against COVID-19,\\\" NSW Health said on its website.\", \"\\\"This evidence will help to inform whether further boosters will be needed in the future.\\\"\", \"Professor McLaws said a fourth shot would likely be needed \\\"down the line\\\" until vaccine researchers develop a jab which is\\u00a0resilient to new strains.\", \"\\\"We're getting this third shot because of Delta and as variants of concern emerge, they're not going to be less infectious, they're going to be even more infectious because they're going to have [experience] battling our immune system,\\\" Professor McLaws said.\", \"She said, however, it was unlikely the fourth shot will be required within six months of the third.\", \"Professor McLaws said a lot of countries were still \\\"learning a lot\\\" and nations were sharing invaluable health data.\", \"\\\"There are countries that have very kindly shared with us their full experiences, the good and the bad.\\\"\", \"<img
