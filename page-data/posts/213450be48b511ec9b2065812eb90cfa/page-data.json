The show, like the book, is set in 1964, and our 11-year-old heroine (voiced by Beanie Feldstein) likes to spy on the people in her neighborhood and document their behaviors, as preparation for someday becoming a writer. But the series has an overall sunnier vibe: Its aesthetic is friendlier than Fitzhugh\\u2019s original illustrations, and the episodic format makes Harriet\\u2019s escapades more pat and discrete. If you agonize over using perfect penmanship on the first page of a notebook, watch this.\", \"\\u2018Blown Away: Christmas\\u2019When to watch: Arrives Friday, on Netflix.\", \"Everyone\\u2019s favorite glassblowing reality contest show is back for a four-episode all-star mini season, judged by the returning Katherine Gray and by the \\u201cQueer Eye\\u201d host Bobby Berk. \\u201cBlown Away\\u201d is always pretty affable, and because this batch of episodes has a Christmas theme, it\\u2019s even more cheery than usual; the two finalists exchange sincere \\u201cI love you\\u201ds right before the winner is crowned. I wish the show spent more time explaining the techniques and processes and less time on the talking-head segments and manufactured agonizing, but that is my wish for all reality shows. If you want something cozy and family friendly but not annoying, or you like competition shows in which you only really need to watch the judging portions, watch this.\", \"\\u2018Shtisel\\u2019When to watch: Now, on Netflix.\", \"The Israeli drama \\u201cShtisel\\u201d (in Hebrew and Yiddish, with subtitles) is perhaps the only show even more \\u201cWho will get the kiss from daddy?\\u201d than \\u201cSuccession.\\u201d Like the Roys, the Shtisels are ruled by a domineering patriarch whose children derive much of their self-worth from his intermittent affection: There\\u2019s a dopey, also-ran son; a favored daughter with a troubled marriage; and the ostensible crown prince, simultaneously tortured and indulged. \\u201cShtisel\\u201d is dreamier than \\u201cSuccession\\u201d and more in touch with grief, but the shows think about family systems and the purpose of purpose in similar, complex ways.\"]","href_hash":"213450be48b511ec9b2065812eb90cfa"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"213450be48b511ec9b2065812eb90cfa"}},
