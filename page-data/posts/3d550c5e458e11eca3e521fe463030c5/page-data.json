She was 96.\", \"Her death was confirmed by her longtime partner and only immediate survivor, Simone Fattal, who did not specify the cause.\", \"For much of her life, Ms. Adnan, who grew up in Lebanon and spent several decades in California, was an international literary figure, her lyrical prose reverberating with generations of Middle Eastern writers.\", \"Her most widely acclaimed novel, \\u201cSitt Marie Rose,\\u201d (1978) based on a true story, centers on a kidnapping during Lebanon\\u2019s civil war and is told from the perspective of the civilians enduring brutal political conflict. It has become a classic of war literature, translated into 10 languages and taught in American classrooms.\", \"Ms. Adnan also wrote numerous collections of poetry. Her latest, \\u201cShifting the Silence,\\u201d was published in October 2020. Reviewing her previous collection, \\u201cNight,\\u201d for The New York Times Book Review, Benjamin Hollander described it as \\u201ca meditative heir to Nietzsche\\u2019s aphorisms, Rilke\\u2019s \\u2018Book of Hours\\u2019 and the verses of Sufi mysticism,\\u201d and \\u201can intricate thread of reflections on pain and beauty.\\u201d\", \"In her poetry, novels and nonfiction, Ms. Adnan often wrote about political discord and violence. Her books on the Middle East, like \\u201cThe Arab Apocalypse,\\u201d a poetry collection from 1980; \\u201cOf Cities and Women (Letters to Fawwaz),\\u201d from 1993; and \\u201cIn the Heart of the Heart of Another Country\\u201d (2005), address the region from sociological, philosophical and historical perspectives.\", \"Ms. Adnan caught the attention of the international art world in her late 80s, when her paintings were included in Documenta 13, the contemporary art exhibition in Kassel, Germany, in 2012. The invitation to the show resulted from a serendipitous visit by Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, Documenta 13\\u2019s director, to Lebanon, where she saw an exhibit of Ms. Adnan\\u2019s geometric and vibrantly colored abstract work on generally small canvases.\", \"Since then, her work has appeared in numerous international exhibitions and art fairs, including the Whitney Biennial in New York in 2014. That same year, she was awarded France\\u2019s highest cultural honor, Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres. An exhibition of her work, \\u201cEtel Adnan: Light\\u2019s New Measure,\\u201d is currently on view at the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan.\", \"Etel Adnan was born on Feb. 24, 1925, in Beirut, Lebanon. Her father, Assaf Kadri, a Syrian born in Damascus, was a retired high-ranking official in the Ottoman army and a former classmate of Mustafa Kemal Atat\\u00fcrk, the founding father of the Republic of Turkey. Her mother, Rosa Kadri, grew up in the city of Smyrna (now the Turkish city of Izmir), which was largely destroyed by fire in 1922.\", \"Her father changed the family\\u2019s surname to Adnan, which was his father\\u2019s first name, in 1932. Ms. Adnan has said that her father was \\u201can unemployable man\\u201d by the age of 40 and that she grew up \\u201cwith people who were defeated when they were still young.\\u201d\", \"She left Lebanon in 1949 to study philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris on a scholarship. A few years later, she moved to the United States for postgraduate studies in philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, and Harvard before settling in California. There, she took up teaching, including a class on the philosophy of art at Dominican College in San Rafael (now the Dominican University of California).\", \"Ms. Adnan said she had been moved to begin writing verse as an act of opposition to the Vietnam War, becoming, in her words, \\u201can American poet.\\u201d\", \"Years earlier, in reverse fashion, it was her teaching that propelled her to the canvas.\", \"\\u201cThe head of the art department wondered how I can teach such a course without practicing painting,\\u201d she told The Paris Review Daily. \\u201cShe gave me crayons and bits of paper, and I started doing little works, and she said I didn\\u2019t need any training, that I was a painter. So I kept going.\\u201d\", \"She was 34 when she began to paint, in 1959.\", \"Ms. Adnan returned to Lebanon in 1972 and shortly thereafter met Ms. Fattal, an artist, in Beirut. Ms. Adnan spent the next few years working as a cultural editor for two of the city\\u2019s daily newspapers.\", \"After civil war broke out in 1975, she fled with Ms. Fattal to Paris. It was there that she wrote \\u201cSitt Marie Rose,\\u201d which was originally published in French, the language she knew best. (Like many Lebanese people, she attended a French school while growing up and could be punished for speaking Arabic, she said.) The novel was unavailable in Lebanese bookstores for many years because its political undertones were deemed too controversial.\", \"Ms. Adnan returned to California in the late 1970s, living in Sausalito, in the Bay Area. There, the view out her window of Mount Tamalpais, northwest of San Francisco, became a repeated source of inspiration for her art, with abstract renderings of the mountain finding their way into her oil paintings.\", \"In a review of Ms. Adnan\\u2019s work at Callicoon Fine Arts gallery on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 2014, Karen Rosenberg wrote in The Times that the peak of Tamalpais was to Ms. Adnan what Mont Sainte-Victoire had been to C\\u00e9zanne.\", \"\\u201cWe come to see Mount Tamalpais as both a specific landmark that offers reassurance to a nomadic artist (once exiled from her home country of Lebanon),\\u201d Ms. Rosenberg wrote, \\u201cand a universal idea of a mountain, upon which memories of different cultures can be projected.\\u201d\", \"While she lived in several cities in her lifetime and spent her last years in Paris, Ms. Adnan continued to consider herself first and foremost as \\u201ca Californian artist.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t say American,\\u201d she told Apollo magazine in 2018. \\u201cThe colors I use, the brightness \\u2014 they are the colors of California.\\u201d\", \"In addition to her taut yet cheerful paintings, Ms. Adnan also drew praise for her leporellos, books folded like an accordion on which she combined drawings, splashes of color and Arabic words and numbers. After discovering leporellos, which were popular with Japanese artists, she decided to appropriate the format for her own work.\", \"In 2018, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art presented a selection of Ms. Adnan\\u2019s paintings alongside some of her written works. The art critic Kaelen Wilson-Goldie, who has written a monograph on Ms. Adnan, wrote that a \\u201cfraught dualism between tranquillity and turbulence\\u201d permeated all of Ms. Adnan\\u2019s work, whether written or painted.\", \"She added: \\u201cIt is as if to say that this is us, we humans as tragically flawed creatures, who are capable of such splendor and ugliness all at once.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3d550c5e458e11eca3e521fe463030c5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3d550c5e458e11eca3e521fe463030c5"}},
