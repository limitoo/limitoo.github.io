From late 2015 until November 2019, Fashion Nova did not approve or post the more negative reviews, which numbered in the hundreds of thousands, the FTC alleged.\", \"Fashion Nova dismissed the FTC's allegations as \\\"inaccurate and deceptive,\\\" saying it addressed the review issues when it became aware of them in 2019.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"All previously unpublished reviews have now been posted to the extent they are actually about the product they were submitted for and do not contain profanity, do not contain threatening language and comply with other reasonable terms,\\\" a spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.\\u00a0\", \"The company believes it would have prevailed in court but opted to settle the case to avoid the distraction and legal fees, the spokesperson added.\\u00a0\", \"The FTC's first case involving a company's efforts to hide poor online reviews of its products should be a warning to other retailers, agency officials said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Deceptive review practices cheat consumers, undercut honest businesses and pollute online commerce,\\\" Samuel Levine, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. \\\"Fashion Nova is being held accountable for those practices, and other firms should take note.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"The settlement is not Fashion Nova's first with the FTC.
