Individuals are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the second shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\", \"That means that even children who get the Pfizer-BioNTech shots right away will not be considered fully immunized until the first week in December \\u2014 too late for Thanksgiving on Nov. 25, or the start of Hanukkah on Nov. 28.\", \"Still, the first shot provides some protection even before the second shot is due, and there remains plenty of time for the 29 million children in that age group to get fully immunized before Christmas, Kwanzaa and New Year\\u2019s Day.\", \"The doses that children ages 5 to 11 are eligible for are one-third the size of the doses available for adults and children over 12.
