Teaching my students about gratitude and kindness, I'm also contributing to them being good citizens, good people,\\\" she told \\\"CBS Mornings\\\" lead national correspondent David Begnaud. \\u00a0\", \"Urzua-Soto made a \\\"gratitude video\\\" to show her students. The short video pairs animated characters along with lessons of gratitude. She has made certain that every student here has seen this video and it's made an impact on some students.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I'm so grateful that I'm accepted at this school.

Sometimes you can feel happy and sometimes you can feel sad,\\\" 8-year-old Heaven Calito said.\\u00a0\", \"Lessons in gratitude proved especially meaningful to Heaven and her 9-year-old brother, Aydan. They recently reunited with their mother after spending two years with relatives because she could not care for them.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I think gratitude means not thinking anything for granted.
