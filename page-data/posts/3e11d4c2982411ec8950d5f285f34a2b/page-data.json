So using current hospitalisation rates as a predictor for what's going to happen in future can be dangerous.\\\"\", \"But a \\\"good quality infection prevalence survey\\\", broadening of testing advice, and asking people to upload both negative and positive rapid antigen test results would help to understand New Zealand's infection rate, he said.\", \"\\\"We need to know about those negative RAT results to know what that rate is. So not just the absolute number of cases.\", \"\\\"But the other thing that would help is some slightly broader requirements or broader encouragement for people to go and get those RATs in the first place.\", \"\\\"So at the moment there's this advice being given out saying only seek a test if you are symptomatic. Well we know with Omicron and particularly for their vaccinated individuals, lots of people are going to be asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms, so they might not even know that they are infected.\", \"\\\"But if those people know that they have been the contact of a confirmed case ... basically through any context other than being a direct household contact, we'd like them to be going and getting a test as well.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"3e11d4c2982411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3e11d4c2982411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
