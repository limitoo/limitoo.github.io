But when a nearly $2 trillion piece of legislation moves through Congress, it affords lawmakers ample opportunity to pursue any number of niche issues \\u2014 and lobbyists and industries plenty of room to notch long-sought victories tucked deep inside thousands of pages of text.\", \"That is the case with the Build Back Better Act, which could aid a wide array of special interests and Democratic allies that have waited for years for such a moment.\", \"\\u201cI welcome the attention. I don\\u2019t think these are fringe, niche issues,\\u201d said Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon, who had no reservations about extolling one of his cherished provisions: the tax incentive to help consumers purchase electric bicycles, or e-bikes.\", \"So far, President Biden and leading Democrats have publicly championed the bill\\u2019s biggest-ticket and most ambitious items. Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader said on Tuesday that he expected a vote on the measure by Friday, though it could slip to Saturday.\", \"Representative Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, the chairman of the House Democrats\\u2019 campaign arm, called it \\u201cthe most important investment in our families, our people, since the New Deal.\\u201d\", \"Republican opponents, too, have largely fixated on the broader issues: the role of government, the economic repercussions of tax increases and the potentially inflationary effect that more government spending could have.\", \"That has left lawmakers that much freer to secure provisions that have largely avoided scrutiny. Representative Jimmy Panetta, Democrat of California and another proponent of electric bike subsidies, said the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee drafted its section of the bill, provision by provision, and no one objected to the e-bike measure, which would cover 30 percent of the cost, up to $900, to, as he put it, \\u201cput butts on bikes.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cOnce you get out there, once you start talking about benefits and once you talk to people who have tried e-bikes, they accept it and they want it,\\u201d he said. Getting the money into the bill \\u201cwas easier than I expected,\\u201d he added.\", \"Such pride of authorship appears to be widely shared. Many obscure provisions may emerge as subjects of ridicule, but Democrats are not shying away from their work. Every niche item has a constituency that regards it as central.\", \"A Senate Republican memo, for instance, singled out the $50 million pilot program, tucked into a broader home health care section, to promote the use of doulas, professionals whose sole priority is to support and provide guidance to birthing mothers. Doulas \\u2014 the word means \\u201cservant\\u201d in Greek \\u2014 typically lack formal obstetric training and provide care such as massage and other touch therapy, rather than medical services. They are used by only a small percentage of pregnant women in the United States.\", \"But some Democratic-led states have moved to broaden access to them, including New York, which began a pilot program to expand Medicaid coverage for doula services. The Democrats who secured the doula funding in the hulking social policy bill do not duck their responsibility for it. Representative Alma Adams, Democrat of North Carolina and co-chairwoman of the Black Maternal Health Caucus, said the doula provision is just one of several she helped secure.\", \"Representative Robin Kelly, Democrat of Illinois, said Black women die in childbirth at four times the rate of white women, arguing that the doula assistance is a necessity.\", \"\\u201cToo many moms have died in the United States, and doulas have the cultural competency to support mothers before, during and after birth,\\u201d Ms. Kelly said. Doulas, she said, are \\u201cadvocates for the birthing mom.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Blumenauer was especially proud of a $1.9 billion provision, written to stave off the death of local news media, that would provide local newspapers and broadcasters a payroll tax credit worth 50 percent of wages up to $50,000 for the first year and 30 percent of wages in the second year for each employee. And it is not confined to tiny outlets; a \\u201cqualifying publication\\u201d must \\u201cserve a local community by providing local news,\\u201d but the credit is capped at 1,500 employees a quarter.\", \"\\u201cThe collapse of local journalism has had serious consequences for our ability to govern,\\u201d Mr. Blumenauer, a senior member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said, pointing to anti-Muslim and other offensive remarks made by a Republican truck driver who defeated New Jersey\\u2019s Senate president this month \\u2014 but revealed by the news media only after his election.\", \"\\u201cThere was no opportunity for local media to provide even basic information about the candidates,\\u201d Mr. Blumenauer said. \\u201cThe guy would never have been elected if he had gotten any scrutiny at all.\\u201d\", \"Some of the measures tucked into the bill have languished for years. In 2007, Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, drafted legislation that would allow lawyers who work on a contingency basis \\u2014 they will be paid only if they win \\u2014 to take a tax write-off of expenses from a case as they are incurred. Currently, such expenses can be claimed only once judgment on the case has been rendered.\", \"Since the measure was written, Mr. Specter switched parties, was defeated and then died, but his work has found its moment. The change would generate considerable savings for trial lawyers \\u2014 $2.5 billion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress\\u2019s nonpartisan referee on tax policy.\", \"\\u201cLawyers working on a contingency fee basis cannot deduct their expenses until the case resolves, which can be years after the expense is incurred,\\u201d said Carly Moore Sfregola, a spokeswoman for the American Association for Justice, the trial lawyers\\u2019 lobby. \\u201cContingency fee arrangements are the only way that regular people can afford to seek justice.\\u201d\", \"And many of the measures have bipartisan origins. An effort to include independent music producers in an existing tax break for film, television and live theatrical productions found a champion in Tennessee\\u2019s conservative firebrand senator, Marsha Blackburn, at the behest of Nashville.\", \"Representative Linda T. S\\u00e1nchez, Democrat of California, initially drafted the Helping Independent Tracks Succeed, or HITS, Act at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, but she was able to bring along Ms. Blackburn, Representative Ron Estes, Republican of Kansas, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California.\", \"Now, with Ms. Sanchez\\u2019s help, the act and its tax deduction of up to $150,000 for the costs of producing sound recordings have found their way into the social policy bill, at a cost to the Treasury of $35 million over 10 years.\", \"Ms. Blackburn has no intention of voting for the larger bill, but, she said, the act still \\u201cis my baby.\\u201d In a recent interview on the Fox Business Network, she condemned the legislation, saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got the socialist Democrats who are trying to push all of these socialist wish list items into this bill.\\u201d\", \"Other provisions might suffer from their names more than their intentions. Tree planting is widely accepted as a way to absorb carbon from the atmosphere, and a provision in the climate change section of the bill to ensure that tree planting include poor neighborhoods might have escaped notice.\", \"But because Democrats used the buzz phrase \\u201ctree equity\\u201d to describe it, Senate Republicans singled out the $2.5 billion provision in a memo as one of the questionable \\u201cearmarks for Democrat interests and allies,\\u201d along with environmental justice tax credits for universities and climate justice block grants.\", \"Republicans have also denounced a $177 million tax credit to entice university donors to support infrastructure research, a provision that Mr. Blumenauer said should be extolled, not ridiculed.\", \"\\u201cLarge research institutions are awash in money,\\u201d he said. \\u201cFor smaller colleges, we\\u2019re trying to give an opportunity to build their own programs on infrastructure and give more flexibility by encouraging private donations.\\u201d\", \"So far, the highest-profile Republicans have kept their criticism at the loftiest level. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, took to the House floor to declare: \\u201cOn the merits, this bill deserves to be defeated. Fundamentally, it\\u2019s anti-worker, anti-family, anti-jobs, anti-energy and anti-American.\\u201d\", \"But as its more obscure provisions come to light, the line of attack may change.\", \"Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, previewed that message before the House Rules Committee last week, when she denounced a bill that she said \\u201cgives kickbacks to your political allies and campaign donors, all while you print record amounts of money that we don\\u2019t have to build more inflation.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ba2eee1847ee11ec86a497eb799f9763"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ba2eee1847ee11ec86a497eb799f9763"}},
