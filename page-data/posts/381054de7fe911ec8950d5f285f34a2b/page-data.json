Last week, as Barty prepared for her third-round match, against Camila Giorgi, she and Crowe did their prematch check-in while walking Molly, Crowe\\u2019s spanador, a mix of a Labrador retriever and a cocker spaniel, in Melbourne Park.\", \"\\u201cAsh loves dogs so that makes for a good setting,\\u201d Crowe said in a recent interview. \\u201cIt creates a happy place to converse. And we\\u2019ll talk about anything. Dogs or house renovations.\\u201d\", \"Tennis players and athletes in nearly every sport have been using sports psychologists and mind-set coaches for years. Never before has mental health been such a primary focus, especially in tennis, which lost one of its biggest stars, Naomi Osaka, for nearly half of 2021 as she dealt with psychological problems connected to the sport and her performance.\", \"Crowe took a circuitous route to his role as a guru to some of the biggest names in sports. He worked as a marketing executive at Nike in the 1990s, trying to connect the stories of athletes to the industry behemoth and make piles of cash for both parties.\", \"He worked closely with Australian athletes, including Cathy Freeman, an Olympic sprinter, on her campaigns ahead of the Games in Atlanta in 1996 and Sydney in 2000, but also with Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi. He became close with Phil Knight, a founder of Nike, who loves both tennis and Australia.\", \"Eventually, Crowe realized it was far more important to athletes for them to truly understand who they were, their back stories and why they did what they did, rather than tying a drummed-up version of their narrative to a global corporation hoping to sell more sneakers and T-shirts.\", \"\\u201cYou need to separate the person from the persona, separate the self-worth from the business card,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI try to get them to answer the questions: Who am I fundamentally? And, What do I want from this crazy thing called life?\\u201d\", \"Crowe has also worked with the professional surfer Stephanie Gilmore and the Richmond club in Australian rules football.\", \"Away from tournaments and matches, he talks with clients weekly for about an hour during occasionally humorous sessions that focus on finding a balance between achievement and fulfillment. There is a simplicity in Crowe\\u2019s bedrock principles:\", \"At a major competition like the Australian Open, Crowe usually watches his clients\\u2019 matches from the stands, paying close attention to their decision making and body language, trying to notice if the things they cannot control \\u2014 the crowd, the weather, the opponent \\u2014 might be distracting them. He attends their news conferences and chats with them before and after each match.\", \"The deep work, though, occurs in the downtime between tournaments, when he delves with them into questions of identity and purpose.\", \"He said Alcott\\u2019s career took off and is now coming to a comfortable close because he came to understand he was playing tennis to help people like himself live better, healthier lives. This week, Alcott received a prestigious award, Australian of the year, given annually to leading citizens. He will play his last professional tennis match on Thursday, in the Australian Open wheelchair quad singles final, but his purpose will not change just because he is retiring.\", \"Barty, who left the sport for 18 months to pursue cricket, draws inspiration from playing for her country, Indigenous people and the team of coaches and trainers she is always crediting for her success. She will meet Madison Keys in a semifinal match on Thursday, and is trying to become the first Australian woman to win the tournament\\u2019s singles championship since 1978.\", \"His tennis clients, he said, have learned to accept their weaknesses and vulnerabilities and the endless uncertainty that professional sport and life ultimately bring.\", \"\\u201cIf there is one thing the pandemic has shown it\\u2019s that we don\\u2019t do uncertainty very well, and uncertainty is vulnerability, and we don\\u2019t do vulnerability very well,\\u201d Crowe said. \\u201cSo you either align yourself with the uncertainty or you suffer.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"381054de7fe911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"381054de7fe911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
