While some military members have chosen to leave rather than be vaccinated, the 27 \\u2014 all with less than six years of service \\u2014 are the first believed to have been fired, Pentagon officials said. \", \"The Defense Department has granted very few exemptions from the mandate, other than to people who were already leaving the military or those who have medical issues. So far, not a single service member has been granted a religious exemption.\", \"The U.S. military routinely requires members to take vaccines to serve and considers being inoculated against the coronavirus essential for basic readiness.\", \"Last month, the newly appointed head of the National Guard in Oklahoma said that his troops would not be required to get vaccinated. Lloyd J. Austin III, the secretary of defense, has told Gov. Kevin Stitt that the troops must comply with the requirement for all service branches. This week, the Pentagon released a new order saying that National Guard members who do not get vaccinated would receive a general order of reprimand; essentially ending their career.\", \"The Pentagon is pondering requiring a booster shot for troops as well.\"]","href_hash":"7a9e78625d0711ec82c98b679440082e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7a9e78625d0711ec82c98b679440082e"}},
