I feel like many of them believe that this action absolves them of any accusation of racism. Personally (I\\u2019m Black) I disagree and believe they have an obligation to actively engage in dismantling racist systems and practices on behalf of their child, rather than merely assimilating the child into their families and social circles, which inevitably reflect these same racist systems and inequitable outcomes. The issue is that one mom whom I know through my community activities has pushed for friendships between her children \\u2014 one of her girls in particular \\u2014 and my 9-year-old daughter. But from what I\\u2019ve seen on social media she is a Trump supporter, has anti-immigrant views and has an \\u201call lives matter\\u201d approach to police violence. I would normally not leave my daughter in the care of adults with these values or become \\u201cmom friends\\u201d with them. But do I have an obligation to get closer to the family for the child\\u2019s sake?\", \"What you said about not wanting to leave your daughter in her care reminded me of a story from my own life: Recently, a friend sent his young Black daughter to a church-sponsored overnight where the white conservative pastor decided to share his views on various nonreligious topics with the kids. She came home parroting points about how bad, scary and criminal Black Lives Matter protests were, having fully embraced these ideas after just a weekend away. I am sure these comments (and whatever else she heard) took a toll on the way she thinks about herself, people who look like her and her place in this country. I don\\u2019t want your daughter to have a similar experience \\u2014 I\\u2019m sure you don\\u2019t either.\", \"You are under no obligation to send your child off to be exposed to the noxious political views of people of any racial background, and you shouldn\\u2019t.\", \"But while I\\u2019m all for avoiding people whose politics are racist or don\\u2019t reflect your values, a child being involved does make things tricky. There\\u2019s definitely something to that nagging feeling you have that she could benefit from having you and your daughter in her life.\", \"I talked about your question with Gina Miranda Samuels, an associate professor at the University of Chicago who studies belonging, identity and kinship among adopted children and is herself a transracial adoptee. She said Black kids adopted by non-Black families can have a hard time when their parents take a \\u201ccolorblind\\u201d approach to parenting. This might look like deciding that a school is \\u201cgood\\u201d based on academics alone, without considering the negative experiences that could come with being one of the few Black children there.\", \"There are also, she said, parents who do understand that being Black means something but think acknowledging that begins and ends with mastering Black hair care and providing a few Black dolls or books with Black characters. What transracially adopted Black kids actually need, she said, are \\u201creal experiences with a bunch of Black people who have cared about them and given them some confidence.\\u201d For a child who hasn\\u2019t had these experiences, \\u201cjust the existence of having a friend who\\u2019s also Black could be really powerful.\\u201d\", \"Your daughter could (I say \\u201ccould\\u201d because shared racial identity isn\\u2019t enough to support a friendship, and for all we know the two kids won\\u2019t even like each other \\u2014 but let\\u2019s hope they do) play that role. You should try to work to make it happen. (I\\u2019ll leave it up to you to figure out how to arrange things so that all play dates take place at your home or somewhere both parents can be present, like a park.)\", \"There\\u2019s one big thing to remember before you suggest that the girls hang out. It sounds like you\\u2019re judging the other mother. That\\u2019s fair. But repeat after me: I will not let this child have any idea at all about my feelings about her family or how she\\u2019s being raised.\", \"Dr. Samuels told me that in conversations with people who were transracially adopted, she often hears that \\u201cyou kind of feel that as a kid you bear the weight of everyone\\u2019s opinion of your family even though it wasn\\u2019t your choice.\\u201d So hearing that her mom\\u2019s worldview and political views are wrong would be really confusing and alienating for the little girl, most likely undoing any of the benefits she gets from having Black people in her life. So remember that you\\u2019re not there to educate or detox her. Simply have a relationship. Give her the experience of not being the only Black person around, and offer \\u2014 through your actions, not your words \\u2014 an example that may counter the message she may receive about Black people.\", \"As awkward as the situation is, I think you\\u2019ll be glad you did. \\u201cAs a Black community, these are our kids,\\u201d Dr. Samuels said. It seems you agree, and at least one child in your community will be better for it.\"]","href_hash":"19c89dbc3e5611ec96a4b16989168c17"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"19c89dbc3e5611ec96a4b16989168c17"}},
