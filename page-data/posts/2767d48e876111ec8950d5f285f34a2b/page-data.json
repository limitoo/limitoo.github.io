But it was not their first collaboration:\\u00a0 \\\"I'm lucky enough to have done so many music videos with Paul that we had such incredible trust,\\\" she said. \", \"With her older sisters, Danielle and Este, Alana is in the Grammy-nominated band, HAIM. Anderson has directed eight of their videos, including this, for their song, \\\"Summer Girl\\\": \", \"Anderson also cast Alana's sisters, and their parents, as her family in the film. One scene, when Alana brings her atheist boyfriend to shabbat dinner, came from real life. Alana said, \\\"I remember telling Paul that story. And then, it was in the script!\\\"\", \"\\\"You knew how to play that scene,\\\" Mason said. \", \"\\\"Oh yeah, I knew how to play that scene. And my dad knew how to play that scene, especially!\\\"\", \"Alana: \\\"Why would you do that! Why would you do that!

And they're, like, 'To see you?'\\\"\", \"Their debut album, \\\"Days Are Gone,\\\" went to #1 in the U.K., and #6 in the U.S., and caught the ear of Anderson, the director of \\\"Boogie Nights,\\\" \\\"Magnolia,\\\" and \\\"Punch Drunk Love,\\\" who unknowingly already had a connection to the Haim sisters, through their mother: \", \"\\\"She was an art teacher,\\\" Danielle said. \", \"\\\"And he was actually her student?\\\" Mason asked. \", \"\\\"Yes, when he was around eight years old,\\\" said Danielle. \\\"But every time one of his movies would pop on the TV when we were growing up, my Mom would be, like, 'You know, I taught the director of this movie.'
