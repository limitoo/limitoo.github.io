The investigation is being handled by F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors in Manhattan who work on public corruption matters, the people said.\", \"Project Veritas did not publish Ms. Biden\\u2019s diary, but dozens of handwritten pages from it were posted on a right wing website on Oct. 24, 2020, at a time when President Donald J. Trump was seeking to undermine Mr. Biden\\u2019s credibility by portraying his son, Hunter, as engaging in corrupt business dealings. The posting was largely ignored by other conservative outlets and the mainstream media.\", \"The website said it had obtained the diary from a whistle-blower who worked for a media organization that refused to publish a story about it before the election. It claimed to know where the actual diary was located and that the whistle-blower had an audio recording of Ms. Biden admitting it was hers.\", \"The Justice Department, then led by Attorney General William P. Barr, opened an investigation into the matter shortly after a representative of the Biden family reported to federal authorities in October 2020 that several of Ms. Biden\\u2019s personal items had been stolen in a burglary, according to two people briefed on the matter.\", \"In recent weeks, federal investigators have reached out to at least one person who worked for Project Veritas to question that person about the diary, one of the people briefed on the case said.\", \"Project Veritas has a history of targeting Democratic congressional campaigns, labor organizations, news media and others. The group conducts sting operations, using hidden cameras and fake identities. At one point, Project Veritas relied on a former British spy named Richard Seddon to help train its operatives, teaching them espionage tactics such as using deception to secure information from potential targets.\", \"Flyover Media, the company that owns the website that published the pages from the diary, is registered to the same Sheridan, Wyo., address as Mr. Seddon\\u2019s company, Branch Six Consulting International. Mr. O\\u2019Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, was once the president of a company that later registered at the same address.\", \"Project Veritas has a pending libel suit against The New York Times over a 2020 story about a video the group made alleging voter fraud in Minnesota.\", \"Ms. Biden, 40, is Mr. Biden\\u2019s youngest child. She has maintained a low profile and attracted far less attention than Hunter Biden, her half brother. In 2019, Mr. Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine at the same time he pressured that country\\u2019s president for support in investigating Hunter Biden\\u2019s business dealings, leading to Mr. Trump\\u2019s first impeachment.\", \"An F.B.I. spokesman in New York would not comment on the investigation, saying only that agents had \\u201cperformed law enforcement activity related to an ongoing investigation\\u201d at two locations. One of the searches took place in an apartment on East 35th Street near the Midtown Tunnel and the other in Mamaroneck, N.Y., north of New York City.\", \"A spokesman for the United States Attorney\\u2019s office in Manhattan declined to comment.\", \"In Manhattan, a neighbor a floor above the apartment that was searched on East 35th Street said she was woken out of her sleep early Thursday morning by agents pounding on a door and repeatedly shouting \\u201cOpen Up!\\u201d and \\u201cF.B.I.!\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI thought it was a joke,\\u201d said the neighbor, Mychael Green, 23. \\u201cFor 10 minutes they we\\u2019re knocking on his door obviously really loud,\\u201d and eventually forced their way into the apartment, Ms. Green said. Hours later, the doorjamb was clearly broken and the door was hanging ajar.\", \"Spencer Meads, the longtime Project Veritas operative and confidante of Mr. O\\u2019Keefe, has lived in that apartment since 2019, according to public records.\", \"Ms. Green said that the agents were yelling \\u201cSpencer, open up!\\u201d\", \"A former Project Veritas employee said that Mr. Meads had been involved in recruiting operatives. A website that tracks Project Veritas operatives said that Mr. Meads had also been involved in undercover operations for the group.\", \"Mr. O\\u2019Keefe did not respond to an emailed request for comment, and a lawyer who has represented him also did not respond to messages. Mr. Meads did not respond to an email and a text message seeking comment.\", \"The Justice Department finds itself in a highly unusual situation in regards to Mr. Biden\\u2019s children. Not only is it investigating the case of Ms. Biden\\u2019s diary, but Hunter Biden disclosed last year that Justice Department prosecutors in Delaware were investigating his taxes.\", \"The pages were posted online under the byline of Patrick Howley, a reporter who has worked for several conservative outlets in recent years. He was the first to disclose a yearbook photo from the page of Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia that showed one individual in a Ku Klux Klan outfit and another individual in blackface.\", \"Mr. Howley also disclosed damaging text messages between Cal Cunningham, a Democrat running for Senate in North Carolina, and a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair.\", \"While the disclosure of Ms. Biden\\u2019s diary was largely ignored, some far right outlets and supporters of Mr. Trump jumped on the news of the diary as further evidence that Mr. Biden was unfit to be president. Alex Jones, a prominent far right radio host, brought up the diary on an episode of Joe Rogan\\u2019s podcast.\", \"Mr. Trump used Twitter to send or promote positive comments about Project Veritas at least six times in the last two years of his presidency. Mr. Trump boosted Project Veritas content even before he became president, and shortly after he announced his campaign for president in 2015, Mr. O\\u2019Keefe visited Trump Tower and showed Mr. Trump footage he was intending to release to damage Hillary Clinton, the most likely Democratic nominee.\", \"In 2016, a Project Veritas operative infiltrated Democracy Partners, a political consulting firm, using a fake name, fabricated r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 and made secret recordings of the staff.\", \"Democracy Partners later sued Project Veritas. In a ruling last month in the lawsuit, U.S. District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman said that Democracy Partners could refer to the conduct by Project Veritas as a \\u201cpolitical spying operation\\u201d in the upcoming trial.\"]","href_hash":"5058f1983e5a11eca87dbbb8d2dc28c8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5058f1983e5a11eca87dbbb8d2dc28c8"}},
