And runs away from them. And runs away from them.\\u201d\", \"The defense countered that the men were carrying out a legal citizen\\u2019s arrest in an area that had been gripped by crime concerns in the months leading up to February 2020, when they chased Mr. Arbery through their neighborhood. Laura D. Hogue, a lawyer for one of the defendants, said that Mr. Arbery, who had been spotted several times on security camera footage at a partially constructed home in the neighborhood, had become \\u201ca recurring nighttime intruder \\u2014 and that is frightening, and unsettling.\\u201d\", \"Jurors are expected to begin their deliberations on Tuesday, after the two-week trial of Travis McMichael, 35, Gregory McMichael, 65, and William Bryan, 52, who are each charged with murder and other crimes in the death of Mr. Arbery outside of Brunswick, Ga. One essential question they must tackle is whether the men had any legal justification for their effort to detain Mr. Arbery.\", \"The men, who all lived in the Satilla Shores neighborhood, attempted to stop Mr. Arbery after the elder Mr. McMichael saw him running in the direction opposite of the partially constructed house on the afternoon of Feb. 23, 2020. Moments earlier, another neighbor had seen Mr. Arbery in the house and had called the police. Mr. McMichael ran into his own house, grabbed a handgun and called to his son, who took a shotgun. They jumped into a pickup truck and gave chase. Soon Mr. Bryan was also going after Mr. Arbery in his own pickup truck.\", \"The argument that the men were not justified in their pursuit, and are therefore guilty of other crimes, including aggravated assault and false imprisonment, was a pillar of Ms. Dunikoski\\u2019s closing statement on Monday. Indeed, it was an argument developed much more fully than the idea that the men had a racial motive, which Ms. Dunikoski mentioned only in passing.\", \"That quite likely reflects the fact that prosecutors did not introduce at trial any evidence of racist language that the men are believed to have used. While prosecutors have declined to discuss their strategy in public, some legal experts believe they decided not to focus too much on racial issues because 11 members of the jury are white and one is Black.\", \"Central to both the defense and prosecution cases is Georgia\\u2019s citizen\\u2019s arrest statute, even though it was largely gutted this year by lawmakers who were motivated by widespread revulsion over the details of Mr. Arbery\\u2019s killing.\", \"The law at the time stated that people could make an arrest if an offense was committed in their presence, or if they had \\u201cimmediate knowledge\\u201d of the offense. If the offense was a felony and the suspect was trying to escape, a private person was also authorized to arrest the suspect \\u201cupon reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Dunikoski told the jury that the law did not apply to the men because they did not have any knowledge that Mr. Arbery had committed a crime that day \\u2014 they merely assumed that he had. If he was guilty of any crime, she said, it was trespassing, which is not a felony but a misdemeanor, meaning they had no right to arrest him. Although video footage shows Mr. Arbery in the house on numerous occasions, including the day he was killed, he is never seen taking, or breaking, anything.\", \"\\u201cIs he this giant burglar who just happened to never show up with a bag, or any means to steal anything, all right, or is he a looky-loo?\\u201d she said.\", \"Jason Sheffield, a lawyer for Travis McMichael, the man who fatally shot Mr. Arbery, said his client had seen Mr. Arbery at the partially built house 12 days earlier, where, Mr. McMichael contends, Mr. Arbery moved his hands toward his waist as if he had a gun.\", \"Mr. Sheffield suggested that Mr. Arbery\\u2019s presence in the house constituted burglary, a felony. Under Georgia law, he said, burglary does not require that anything actually be stolen. \\u201cYou just have to enter with the intent to steal something,\\u201d he said.\", \"All of this, Mr. Sheffield argued, gave Travis McMichael probable cause to believe that Mr. Arbery committed a burglary, therefore giving him a justification to try to detain him.\", \"Mr. Sheffield, in an apparent attempt to deflect the allegation of a racial motive, noted that Mr. McMichael had, on a separate occasion, called the police about a suspicious white person under a nearby bridge in his effort to keep the neighborhood safe.\", \"And, as expected, Mr. Sheffield argued that Mr. McMichael had acted in self-defense when he shot Mr. Arbery at close range while the two men violently engaged at the end of the pursuit. Mr. Sheffield noted that Mr. Arbery used his fists during his struggle with Mr. McMichael, and he said there was \\u201cno question\\u201d that Mr. Arbery got his hands on Mr. McMichael\\u2019s gun. In a statement to the police shortly after the shooting, Mr. McMichael had said he was not sure if Mr. Arbery had grabbed the shotgun.\", \"Ms. Dunikoski said that on the day he was killed, Mr. Arbery was on foot and unarmed, and posed no threat to the defendants.\", \"Ms. Hogue, a lawyer for Gregory McMichael, had some of the harshest words for Mr. Arbery. She portrayed him as someone who probably had sinister intentions, describing him as skulking around \\u201ca home drenched in absolute darkness.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Hogue said that Mr. Arbery might have shown promise as a teenager but that he had veered in the \\u201cwrong direction\\u201d and had no legitimate reason to be in Satilla Shores on the day he was shot to death. She particularly sought to challenge the prosecution\\u2019s depiction of her client\\u2019s motivations and of Mr. Arbery.\", \"\\u201cAhmaud Arbery was not an innocent victim,\\u201d Ms. Hogue said.\", \"In his closing argument, Kevin Gough, the lawyer for Mr. Bryan, distanced his client from the McMichaels, pointing out that Mr. Bryan, who goes by Roddie, did not even know Travis McMichael and had only passing interactions with Gregory McMichael.\", \"\\u201cRoddie Bryan\\u2019s presence is absolutely superfluous and irrelevant to the tragic death of Ahmaud Arbery,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Bryan did not know and could not have known that the other two men were armed or that Mr. Arbery would be shot, Mr. Gough said. \\u201cBy the time he knew there was nothing he could do,\\u201d the lawyer said. And though the McMichaels had guns with them, Mr. Bryan \\u201cwas armed only with his cellphone,\\u201d Mr. Gough said.\", \"At various points in the trial, Mr. Gough had raised the possibility of severing his client\\u2019s case from that of the other two defendants. He made a motion for severance on Monday morning that was rejected by Judge Timothy R. Walmsley.\", \"It was Mr. Bryan who recorded the video that showed the moment when Travis McMichael shot and killed Mr. Arbery. The public release of the video, in May 2020, stoked widespread outrage and significantly increased national interest in the case. The McMichaels were arrested shortly thereafter, followed by Mr. Bryan.\", \"Mr. Gough asked the jury to take into account that Mr. Bryan had acted in good faith when he cooperated with the authorities, giving them access to, among other things, the phone he had used to record the footage.\", \"He credited Mr. Bryan\\u2019s recording of that video to \\u201cserendipity, luck, coincidence or the hand of God.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"2a6bf7d64c0211ecbda779cbbfa931e3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2a6bf7d64c0211ecbda779cbbfa931e3"}},
