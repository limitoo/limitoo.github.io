Over the coming months, whether you\\u2019re watching new films on a streaming service or at the multiplex, more than a few of those movies are likely to be in black and white.\", \"Films as varied as \\u201cThe French Dispatch\\u201d and \\u201cBeing the Ricardos\\u201d employ several black-and-white sequences, while \\u201cPassing,\\u201d \\u201cBelfast\\u201d and \\u201cThe Tragedy of Macbeth\\u201d are shot almost entirely without color. These are all period movies that use the old-fashioned format to evoke a bygone era, but even \\u201cC\\u2019mon C\\u2019mon,\\u201d which takes place in contemporary times and has Joaquin Phoenix as a radio journalist crisscrossing the country with his nephew, was filmed in monochrome.\", \"Is this all a coincidence, or a natural next step after recent black-and-white stunners like \\u201cRoma\\u201d and \\u201cCold War\\u201d? To understand why everyone is going grayscale, we talked to the cinematographers behind three of the season\\u2019s most striking black-and-white features.\", \"For his new spin on Shakespeare\\u2019s \\u201cMacbeth,\\u201d the director Joel Coen wanted to strip the play down to its barest essence. The result is a fast and ruthless reimagining leached of all color, shot not in wide-screen but in a claustrophobic 4:3 aspect ratio rarely used since the 1950s.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s meant to bring theatricality, and to lose temporality,\\u201d the cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not about the 1700s, and it\\u2019s not about Scotland, either. We\\u2019re giving an abstraction, but a very creative one.\\u201d\", \"For Delbonnel, the creative limitations of black-and-white proved intoxicating. \\u201cI pushed the envelope even more,\\u201d Delbonnel said. \\u201cI said we shouldn\\u2019t have any furniture, and we pushed this very far: There is only one bed and a couple of tables, and there is no practical light.\\u201d\", \"All that austerity makes a striking visual impression, but Delbonnel said it was simply in service of the play\\u2019s language. The same creative rules applied to the actors Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand, who could tackle their roles as Shakespeare\\u2019s most fearsome power couple in the most unadorned fashion.\", \"As Delbonnel put it, \\u201cYou say, \\u2018Denzel, this is the room. There is no place to sit because there is no chair. There is no glass, so you can\\u2019t drink. There is nothing you can do, so it\\u2019s all about your body language and the way you deliver the lines.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Still, don\\u2019t get the wrong impression: Though this \\u201cMacbeth\\u201d was made in the spirit of minimalism, Delbonnel often brought in the boldest lights he could muster.\", \"\\u201cThe whole movie is lit with theater light, like you\\u2019d see at a Beyonc\\u00e9 concert, which has very, very hard shadows,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIn color, it would be unbearable, but in black-and-white, it looks amazing.\\u201d\", \"While he shot Rebecca Hall\\u2019s \\u201cPassing,\\u201d the cinematographer Eduard Grau was so committed to the film\\u2019s monochrome aesthetic that he took all the color off his iPhone, too.\", \"\\u201cEven when I was taking photos, they would be in black and white,\\u201d Grau said. \\u201cYou do things like that to see the world without color, to train your brain to forget about that green or pink wall and only look at the level of brightness or darkness.\\u201d\", \"Based on the 1929 novel by Nella Larsen, \\u201cPassing\\u201d is about two light-skinned Black women: Irene (Tessa Thompson), a well-respected but restless doctor\\u2019s wife, and Clare (Ruth Negga), her childhood friend who has been passing for white. A chance meeting in a hotel tearoom reunites the two after years spent apart, and Grau chose to flood that initial encounter with a striking amount of white light.\", \"\\u201cThis is the brightest I\\u2019ve ever done a scene in my life,\\u201d Grau said. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t see that a lot, especially in dramas, to have such a bright scene without a lot of detail in the whites. It also came from the fact that we didn\\u2019t want to clearly show to the audience at first whether our characters were white or Black or mixed race. Everything is so bright that it\\u2019s difficult to tell.\\u201d\", \"Like \\u201cThe Tragedy of Macbeth,\\u201d \\u201cPassing\\u201d is filmed not just in black and white but also in a boxy aspect ratio that recalls some of Hollywood\\u2019s earliest feature films. (It may also remind the viewer how limited those movies were when it came to race, a thorny topic that the color scheme of \\u201cPassing\\u201d serves as a meta comment on.)\", \"Grau couldn\\u2019t have foreseen similarities with other current films when he made \\u201cPassing,\\u201d but he said he welcomed this winter\\u2019s bounty of black-and-white stories.\", \"\\u201cI think it is a coincidence, but this is also about love of film, and they are all true filmmakers,\\u201d Grau said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a strong starting point when a director chooses that, a good indication. Strong, powerful visions from directors make for good movies.\\u201d\", \"Over 15 years of shooting movies with the director Kenneth Branagh, the cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos has come to see color as both a blessing and a curse.\", \"\\u201cColor is so brilliantly descriptive in film, and even the color of someone\\u2019s eyes gives you so much information,\\u201d Zambarloukos said. \\u201cBut I often find that when I\\u2019m making films with Ken, we\\u2019re trying to remove information for the audience and present them with what we want them to see.\\u201d\", \"Their new film, \\u201cBelfast,\\u201d about a young Irish boy coming of age in the turbulent 1960s, doesn\\u2019t eschew color entirely: It\\u2019s bookended by two color montages of modern-day Belfast, and whenever our young protagonist, Buddy, goes to the movies, the films he watches come to life in vivid color.\", \"But for the most part, whether Buddy is wooing a girl at school or trying to make sense of the conflict that grips his parents (Jamie Dornan and Caitriona Balfe), \\u201cBelfast\\u201d is shot in shimmering silvers.\", \"\\u201cIn this case, I think we\\u2019re using a strength of black and white, which is not to tell you how a person or place looks but how they feel,\\u201d Zambarloukos said. \\u201cIt has a transcendental quality to be of the past and the present. It\\u2019s realistic, but it has a certain magical sense to it as well.\\u201d\", \"Zambarloukos cut his teeth on the format while shooting Branagh\\u2019s long-delayed \\u201cDeath on the Nile\\u201d (due in February), which opens with a 10-minute sequence in black and white. But now, after having filmed all those \\u201cBelfast\\u201d close-ups without color, he admits it will be hard to go back to reds, yellows and blues.\", \"\\u201cIf I saw the same portrait of a person in color and in black and white, most of the time, I would tell more about that person from black-and-white,\\u201d Zambarloukos said. \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t create anything that isn\\u2019t there, but whatever is there is so amplified!\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"71c368563c8711ecbccc000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"71c368563c8711ecbccc000017025a03"}},
