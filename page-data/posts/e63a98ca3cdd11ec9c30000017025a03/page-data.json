Catholic priest, Father Anthony Bongiorno.\", \"In their final submission to the inquest into Ms James's\\u00a0murder, they proposed an\\u00a0exhumation, if certain DNA tests currently available\\u00a0prove inconclusive.\", \"\\\"The coroner ought to order further testing and possible exhumation, before finalising any findings,\\\" counsel for the James family wrote.\", \"Maria James was stabbed to death in her Thornbury second-hand bookshop\\u00a0in 1980.\", \"She'd learned a local priest, Fr Bongiorno, had been abusing her younger son, Adam, and she was set to confront him on the day she was murdered.\", \"However, while the coroner has warned the inquest may not give the James family the closure it is seeking, there are new avenues of inquiry.\", \"As well as the potential exhumation of Fr Bongiorno, Victoria Police has\\u00a0confirmed it has found a woman who may be a crucial witness, after a tip-off passed to it by the ABC podcast Trace.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">The molecule of life</div>\", \"Counsel for the James family wrote in its final submission that, if DNA testing involving hair came\\u00a0to nothing, Fr Bongiorno should be exhumed.\", \"\\\"The existence of multiple, independent accounts of sightings of Fr Bongiorno on the date of the murder, closely proximate to the scene of the murder, and appearing to be significantly bloodied support a proposition that Fr Bongiorno is a realistic suspect in this case and should therefore be exhumed, if the hair sampling is unsuccessful.\\\"\", \"<img

biological traces found on Maria James' pillows and bed quilt.\", \"Biologists have found what's called partial, mixed DNA profiles \\u2014 that is, some DNA from Maria James, some from an unknown person.\", \"These profiles have already been compared to four persons of interest: former real estate agent, Peter Macevski (the only living person of interest), convicted killer Peter Keogh, Mario Falcucci and Lyle Perkins.\", \"Results suggested it was\\u00a0unlikely the DNA at the crime scene was theirs.\", \"However, comparative tests are yet to be conducted on the remaining two persons of interest: Fr Bongiorno and Fr Thomas O'Keeffe.\", \"However, before the weighty option of exhumation is considered, there is a less-invasive DNA test that could be done.\", \"<div

mitochondrial DNA testing and, therefore, used for comparisons to include or exclude persons of interest.\", \"\\\"Bradley [Kathryn Bradley, forensic biologist at the Victoria Police Forensic Services Centre] concedes that it's possible that the hair sample is from the offender.\\\"\", \"With mitochondrial DNA testing, instead of needing direct DNA from the priests themselves, samples from their siblings can instead be used.\", \"Victoria Police could use a sample it covertly took from Fr Bongiorno's sister in 2014 and a sample from Fr O'Keeffe's twin-brother, provided by the ABC's Trace
