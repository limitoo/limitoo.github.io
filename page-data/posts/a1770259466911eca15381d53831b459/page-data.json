House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has also urged the House Ethics Committee to investigate Gosar's actions, and for McCarthy to publicly condemn them.\", \"This weekend, Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, slammed the GOP for failing to reprimand Gosar, calling the video \\\"dangerous, disgusting and despicable.\\\" \", \"\\\"In any other workplace in America if a coworker made an animated film killing another coworker, that person would be fired,\\\" Lieu said while speaking on The Dean Obeidallah Show Friday.\", \"At least two Republicans\\u2014Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger\\u2014have also joined Democrats in condemning Gosar's actions.
