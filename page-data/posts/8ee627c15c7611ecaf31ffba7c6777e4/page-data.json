At least 1,000 families were left homeless or struggling to repair severely damaged properties; thousands more had no electricity. Officials confirmed that 74 people had died \\u2014 a toll that will almost certainly grow as crews continue to pick through mountains of rubble.\", \"The agonizing aftermath of the tornadoes has compounded what was already a challenging year in Kentucky.\", \"In February, a powerful ice storm downed trees and cut off power to 150,000 people in eastern Kentucky. In July, a flash flood left people stranded in their homes. Autumn brought a frightening spike in the coronavirus that made the pandemic \\u201cas bad in Kentucky as it has ever been,\\u201d Gov. Andy Beshear told residents as intensive care units filled and the death count climbed.\", \"\\u201cAnd now we have this,\\u201d Mr. Beshear said during a disaster briefing on Monday morning, his voice freighted by the exhaustion and emotional toll of the latest crisis he has had to contend with since taking office two years ago.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ll push through all of it because we don\\u2019t have a choice,\\u201d Mr. Beshear said. \\u201cAnd we\\u2019re strong enough to do it.\\u201d\", \"The tornadoes, which included the largest in the state\\u2019s history, mangled many communities beyond recognition. In a state already challenged by some of the highest poverty rates in the United States, officials cautioned that recovery would be slow.\", \"\\u201cThis will go on for years,\\u201d said Michael Dossett, director of the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management.\", \"The devastation is staggering, but it also reflects a magnified version of a familiar story across the country as recurring disasters \\u2014 many linked to the rippling consequences of a changing climate \\u2014 are testing the bandwidth of state officials in ways they never have before.\", \"At the center of this struggle in Kentucky is Mr. Beshear, whose connection to the disaster is especially personal. Among the hardest-hit communities is Dawson Springs, a town of just 2,600 people where his father was born and his grandfather owned a funeral home. Early on, the governor said, the list of the missing in that town alone was eight pages long, single-spaced. Elsewhere, he said, the dead included two of his uncle\\u2019s cousins in Muhlenberg County.\", \"Mr. Beshear is two years into his first term and a somewhat unlikely presence as a Democrat leading a deeply conservative state. In a time of bitter division, he has navigated the state through the treacherous partisanship of mask mandates and vaccine requirements, as well as the upheaval and inflamed racial tensions stoked by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville last year.\", \"The gravity of this most recent crisis was evident on Monday as Mr. Beshear strained to hold back tears at a news briefing. He choked up as he noted that the ages of those who died ranged from five months to 86 years. Eighteen victims were still unidentified. In the morning he reported the death toll as 64; by afternoon that number had risen to 74, with as many as 109 people still unaccounted for.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not doing so well today,\\u201d the governor said. \\u201cI was working on getting the confirmed deaths this morning and realized I was writing on the back of notes that one of my kids took from school.\\u201d The topic of the schoolwork was inertia, which he said was appropriate, adding, \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to keep putting one foot in front of the other.\\u201d\", \"The governor noted the toll of compounding crises. \\u201cIf dealing with all this isn\\u2019t enough, we have a pandemic,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s continuing, and it\\u2019s continuing to take lives of Kentuckians.\\u201d\", \"President Biden, who intends to visit Kentucky on Wednesday, expressed concern about how the vast destruction and the uncertainty now facing survivors would weigh on the state\\u2019s collective mental health. \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to be there as long as it takes to help,\\u201d he said at a news conference on Monday.\", \"There were more concrete worries, too. Tom Watson, the mayor of Owensboro, Ky., marveled at the sheer magnitude of rubble and debris scattered across the state. \\u201cWhere are they going to put all this junk?\\u201d he said. \\u201cIn the country we usually just set it on fire. But this is 220 miles.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Beshear, 44, was narrowly elected in 2019, and the turbulence picked up within months of his taking office. In March 2020, a 27-year-old cake maker at a Walmart in Cynthiana, Ky., was at the center of one of the earliest rural outbreaks of Covid-19 \\u2014 an episode in the fumbling first days of the pandemic that offered a small taste of what was to come.\", \"That month, Ms. Taylor was killed in a botched police raid on her apartment \\u2014 a case that galvanized activists in Kentucky and was swept up in the broader reckoning over race prompted by the killing of George Floyd. Protests erupted in Louisville over the summer after a grand jury decided that the two police officers who shot Ms. Taylor while returning fire would not be charged, while a third officer would be charged with wanton endangerment for jeopardizing the lives of Ms. Taylor\\u2019s neighbors.\", \"Later, Mr. Beshear demanded the release of the evidence presented to the jury, saying that people should be able to \\u201ccome to their own conclusions about justice.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cOne of the problems we\\u2019ve had over the last six months is a total lack of explanation and information,\\u201d the governor said. \\u201cAnd the vacuum that\\u2019s created there \\u2014 our emotions, frustrations \\u2014 can truly fill that.\\u201d\", \"This fall, as the pandemic intensified, Mr. Beshear sparred with Republican lawmakers who control the State Legislature and limited the measures that the governor could take to curb the virus\\u2019s spread. \\u201cIf I had the ability to do it right now, we would have a masking order when you are in public and indoors,\\u201d he said in an appearance on the NBC program \\u201cMeet the Press.\\u201d\", \"By September, Kentucky had some of the worst incidence rates in the country.\", \"\\u201cWhen you\\u2019re at war, you don\\u2019t get to cry about what you can or can\\u2019t do,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou have got to do your very best every day because this is a battle of life versus death.\\u201d\", \"Polls show that the governor has been able to maintain his support among residents. One survey from Morning Consult in November found that 54 percent of Kentucky voters approved of his performance.\", \"Trey Grayson, a Republican lawyer and lobbyist and former secretary of state, said that the overall tornado response has given Kentuckians a reason to come together despite an increasingly fractious partisan atmosphere in the Statehouse and beyond. \\u201cThe state\\u2019s really united in rallying behind the governor and rallying behind the victims,\\u201d he said.\", \"In the days before the tornadoes descended, there had been indications of rough storms. Still, it was December, outside of the season when residents knew to expect tornadoes. The storms swept in on Friday evening, and even in the darkness, it was clear that the impact was astonishing.\", \"A candle factory with about 110 workers assumed to be inside had been shredded. In those early hours, at least 50 people were believed to be dead, though that number would eventually shrink. On Saturday morning, in one of the governor\\u2019s earliest briefings, one of the few certainties was that the sun would lift the veil of darkness to reveal something horrifying.\", \"\\u201cDaybreak is going to bring more tough news,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"8ee627c15c7611ecaf31ffba7c6777e4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8ee627c15c7611ecaf31ffba7c6777e4"}},
