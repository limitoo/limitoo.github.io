That's an 18-fold increase in the number losses related to social media fraud since 2017, according to the agency.\", \"Over 95,000 victims \\u2014 more than twice the number in 2020 \\u2014 said they lost money after falling prey to a deceptive ad, post or message they received on a messaging, photo-sharing or similar app.\\u00a0\", \"Investment scams accounted for the biggest chunk of dollars lost, with payment made in cryptocurrency in 64% of these cases, the FTC said this week.

It can also be hard to identify bad actors who manufacture sophisticated-looking profiles that can appear legitimate.\\u00a0\", \"For example, con artists can pose as a target's friend or connection by duplicating the profile of an authentic contact in their network, then appeal to that person directly to ask for money or request help.
