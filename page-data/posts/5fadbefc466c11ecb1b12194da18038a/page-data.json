They are betting that the bipartisan victory will allow him to project sustained progress in confronting the nation\\u2019s problems \\u2014 not just being different from former President Donald J. Trump.\", \"\\u201cI truly believe that 50 years from now, historians are going to look back at this moment and say, That is the moment America began to win the competition for the 21st century,\\u201d Mr. Biden said, standing before hundreds of mayors, governors, lawmakers and others with the White House gleaming on a brisk and sunny Washington afternoon behind him.\", \"To chants of \\u201cJoe! Joe! Joe!\\u201d Mr. Biden called the infrastructure bill \\u201cproof that despite the cynics, Democrats and Republicans can come together and deliver results.\\u201d\", \"But the president and his top advisers also understand the uncertainty in the country\\u2019s deeply polarized electorate, the difficult battles yet to come on Capitol Hill and the often fleeting nature of political victories in the age of 280-character messages on Twitter and vanishing stories on Instagram.\", \"Will Monday\\u2019s victory be the steppingstone that Mr. Biden needs for a political turnaround, proving to voters that they got what they expected when they put him in office last year? Or will it be a blip in time, destined to be quickly forgotten among the Washington rancor that is on the way in the days ahead?\", \"\\u201cIt is a victory in which Biden\\u2019s leadership really mattered,\\u201d said Matt Bennett, a senior executive for Third Way, a Democratic-leaning group that presses lawmakers in both parties to work together. \\u201cThat could signal that this is the beginning of a real virtuous circle for him.\\u201d\", \"But Mr. Bennett, who attended the signing ceremony, added that the real test for Mr. Biden will be \\u201cshaping the public narrative on the enormous benefits of the infrastructure act that is being signed today.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThat is going to require enormous discipline on the part not only of the president,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbut also congressional Democrats.\\u201d\", \"The outcome could help determine the fate of Mr. Biden\\u2019s presidency and the course of the Democratic Party as lawmakers prepare to defend their slim majorities in the House and the Senate in next year\\u2019s midterm elections.\", \"Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and one of 10 senators who worked to shape the infrastructure compromise, praised Mr. Biden and Democrats in Congress.\", \"\\u201cThis is what can happen when Republicans and Democrats decide we\\u2019re going to work together to get something done,\\u201d said Mr. Portman, who is not running for re-election. (Mr. Biden later called Mr. Portman \\u201ca hell of a good guy,\\u201d adding that he could only say that without hurting him politically because of the senator\\u2019s decision not to seek another term.)\", \"Monday\\u2019s signing ceremony was the culmination of a long effort for Mr. Biden. In the Senate, the legislation passed by a lopsided vote of 69 to 30, with even Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader and a chief Biden critic, voting yes. In the House, Mr. Biden wooed a bigger-than-expected group of Republicans to support the effort to repair the nation\\u2019s crumbling roads, bridges and airports.\", \"That has been a bipartisan talking point for years; even Mr. Trump repeatedly proclaimed that it was \\u201cInfrastructure Week\\u201d in Washington, only to see little progress. \", \"\\u201cThis is a great accomplishment,\\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi told the crowd on Monday. \\u201cAnd there\\u2019s more to come.\\u201d\", \"That was clearly the message Mr. Biden wanted to send. His White House staff developed the event with the kind of stagecraft usually reserved for political conventions or campaign events. Flags from each state flapped in the background as Mr. Biden, flanked by Vice President Kamala Harris and a union worker from North Carolina, strode to the lectern as \\u201cHail to the Chief\\u201d played.\", \"Now, the challenge for the president is to convince voters that passage of the legislation actually matters to their lives \\u2014 that it is not just a Washington abstraction, debated in the halls of Congress but with little impact on them.\", \"That effort begins in earnest immediately.\", \"The ceremony on Monday will be followed by a burst of presidential travel aimed at showing the American people real examples of how the new law will pump money into the economy and provide good-paying jobs by upgrading roads, bridges, lead pipes, broadband and other infrastructure.\", \"On Tuesday, Mr. Biden is expected to travel to New Hampshire, where he will speak at a bridge over the Pemigewasset River, which is in critical need of rehabilitation. The next day, he will visit a General Motors electric vehicle assembly plant in Detroit to showcase the billions of dollars to be spent on upgrading electric charging stations around the country.\", \"\\u201cNow is an opportunity for the president, the vice president, our cabinet,\\u201d Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Monday, \\u201cto be out in the country, connecting the agenda, the impacts on people\\u2019s lives, moving beyond the legislative process to talk about how this is going to help them. And we\\u2019re hoping that\\u2019s going to have an impact.\\u201d\", \"History suggests the president and his team have their work cut out for them.\", \"Former President Barack Obama campaigned around the country during his first term in office, telling Americans that the Affordable Care Act would \\u201cbend the cost curve\\u201d for health insurance and improve coverage. But early glitches in the Obamacare website and opposition from the newly formed Tea Party made the law toxic in many places for many years.\", \"After Mr. Trump passed tax cuts early in his tenure, he hosted a similar celebration (though without the bipartisan sheen) and then failed to sell it to the broader public. Throughout his tenure, the tax cuts remained a largely partisan victory.\", \"During his campaign for president, Mr. Biden promised that he would be able to win the support of Republicans and Democrats for his policies. That message resonated with voters after four years in which Mr. Trump clashed spectacularly with Democrats.\", \"But much of Mr. Biden\\u2019s legislation so far has been passed with little support from the opposing party. His $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package was passed in the Senate and the House without any Republican support. And his $1.85 trillion social spending plan, known as Build Back Better, is likely to pass with only Democratic votes.\", \"At home, the president still faces deeply divisive issues such as what to do about the border, clashes about racial sensitivity in schools, prison reform and voting rights. And overseas, Mr. Biden will be confronted with the need to rein in China and Russia, continue to repair relationships with allies and fight terrorism.\", \"In his remarks on Monday, though, Mr. Biden was all smiles.\", \"\\u201cAs I look out and describe the day, I see Democrats and Republicans, national leaders, local leaders, all elected officials, labor leaders, businesses,\\u201d Mr. Biden said, clearly relishing the moment of victory in a tumultuous year.\", \"\\u201cMost of all,\\u201d he said, \\u201cI see fellow Americans, I see America. Let\\u2019s remember this day. Let\\u2019s remember we can come together. Most of all, let\\u2019s remember what we\\u2019ve got done for the American people when we do come together.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"5fadbefc466c11ecb1b12194da18038a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5fadbefc466c11ecb1b12194da18038a"}},
