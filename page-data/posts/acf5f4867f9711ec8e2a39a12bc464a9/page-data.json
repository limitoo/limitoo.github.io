He was part of a marquee class of quarterbacks selected that year that included Eli Manning and Philip Rivers.\", \"Known for his escapability and 6-foot-5, 240-pound frame, one more befitting of a linebacker, Roethlisberger guided the Steelers to their first championship in more than a quarter of a century in 2006, defeating the Seattle Seahawks, 21-10, in Super Bowl XL. \", \"Roethlisberger advanced to the Super Bowl two more times in his career, winning a thriller against the Arizona Cardinals after the 2008 season but falling to the Green Bay Packers, another legacy franchise with a prolific quarterback (Aaron Rodgers), in 2011.\", \"But detracting from that legacy were two different sexual assault allegations against Roethlisberger.\", \"In 2009, a hotel employee at a Lake Tahoe resort in Nevada filed a civil suit saying that Roethlisberger had raped her in his hotel room.

His suspension was for six games, which was later reduced to four.\", \"Roethlisberger\\u2019s career was also derailed by injuries and clashes with some of the team\\u2019s offensive coordinators and other players. He spent his entire career with the Steelers.\", \"He collected 165 regular-season wins as a starting quarterback, fifth most in league history, and sits in the top 10 in the major career passing categories, a r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 that is expected to earn him a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\"]","href_hash":"acf5f4867f9711ec8e2a39a12bc464a9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"acf5f4867f9711ec8e2a39a12bc464a9"}},
