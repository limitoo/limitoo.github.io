His comments came amid fears in the West of a possible Russian invasion into Ukraine after reports emerged of a Russian troop buildup near its border with the ex-Soviet nation.\", \"The eastern edge of Ukraine for years has been the site of a pro-Russian separatist insurgency that has left more than 14,000 people dead. Moscow has lent its support to the separatists while Ukrainian forces have battled them since 2014 when Russia also annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.\", \"Putin told Macron during their call that Ukrainian authorities were \\\"deliberately aggravating the situation on the line of contact\\\" in the east. He also said that they were supported by \\\"a number of Western countries,\\\" according to the Kremlin's readout of their talks.\", \"Putin also said that Ukraine \\\"is being pumped up with modern weapons, which poses a direct threat to Russia's security.\\\"\", \"The Russian leader's talks with both Macron and Finnish President Sauli Niinist\\u00f6 on Tuesday revolved around the heightened Ukraine tensions. While the West worries about potential Russian aggression in Ukraine, Putin has sought assurances that NATO will not expand eastward or deploy weapons there.\", \"\\\"The Russian president emphasized the importance of immediately launching international negotiations to develop legally fixed guarantees that would prevent any further NATO expansion to the east and the deployment of weapons to neighboring states, primarily in Ukraine, that threaten Russia,\\\" the Kremlin said in a statement.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1951907/putin-accusations.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukrainian authorities of \\u201cdeliberately aggravating the situation\\u201d in the long-warring eastern section of Ukraine while speaking with French President Emmanuel Macron Tuesday.
