So when my mom passed me a pristine white rectangular box, I got excited. It stood out from the Amazon Prime boxes in its impeccable condition, and it was heavy too. My excitement only mounted when I saw my mom\\u2019s grin, which stretched to her ears. I undid the magnetic seal to discover a bottle of sparkling wine, coated in a tacky gold glitter, along with two flutes (one broken) and a confetti popper \\u2014 a great gift for a New Year\\u2019s Eve party I had no plans to attend.\", \"For a moment, as I sifted through the box trying not to slice my fingers on the broken glass, I was slightly offended by what seemed like leftover office-holiday-\\u200bparty swag. I looked up at my mom, whose face was pink with glee, and realized it was exactly that. \\u201cRewrap!\\u201d she hollered, clapping her hands. My family erupted into a laughter that made the Christmas tree ornaments jingle. I should\\u2019ve known.\", \"That morning, I became the latest dupe in a relentless family tradition that we call \\u201cthe rewrap,\\u201d whereby we not-so-subtly repackage unwanted gifts and pass them off to one another as \\u201cnew.\\u201d Every year, without fail, we punk each other with a circular economy of random stuff that nobody wants and never needed to begin with.\", \"The tradition can be traced back to my grandmother, Nana Pat. As a mother of five children and host to dozens of friends and extended family on Christmas, individual gifts were not always feasible for Nana. So when the holidays rolled around, she started searching around the house for past unused gifts, and quietly began rewrapping them. In the late \\u201970s, she became a second-grade schoolteacher, and over the holidays her students\\u2019 parents would give her gifts of appreciation. Her mischief went undetected for years, until one Christmas when Nana blew her own cover: She had rewrapped a glass decanter for an aunt named Mary, who discovered a note thanking Nana for a great semester.\", \"The practice has taken on a life of its own in my big, riotous Irish Catholic family. One year, when my mom was in her 20s and working in New York City, she came home to New Jersey for Christmas. She was living in a small apartment in the city at the time, so she had left some clothes in her childhood bedroom. When the family began exchanging gifts in the living room, my mom was horrified to discover that Nana had taken her favorite black coat and rewrapped it for another aunt named Loretta. \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018I love this!\\u2019\\u201d my mom remembers Aunt Loretta saying. \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018This is absolutely beautiful!\\u2019\\u201d\", \"As a kid, I was not privy to the joke of the rewrap. I was only introduced to the game as a young adult, and I found myself perplexed as to how this bizarre joke could be a form of affection. To be sure, rewraps are just the hors d\\u2019oeuvres to our more traditional gifts, which, we are lucky, have never been in short supply. But in my nomadic 20s, I could not understand how my mom thought it was nice or funny to rewrap and gift me arbitrary home goods I had little use for \\u2014 from soap bars to salad tongs \\u2014 often without even bothering to change the packaging.\", \"As earnest as it sounds, I\\u2019ve always taken gift-giving seriously. Before the pandemic, I lived and worked abroad in Hong Kong as a journalist for three years. Being away from my family in the U.S. was difficult, so collecting gifts during my travels became an important way for me to nurture my relationships from across the Pacific. From 1920s panoramas of the Hong Kong skyline to soy-sauce dishes from local markets, I stuffed my suitcase with handpicked souvenirs from my faraway life that we could relish together at home. So to receive a leftover bottle of wine after spending hours on typewritten cards felt like showing up to a \\u201cfriend date\\u201d thinking it\\u2019s an actual date.\", \"Then a few years ago, my family hosted about a dozen of us for a Secret Santa gift exchange on Christmas. I had forgotten to buy a gift and, for once, decided I would pull a rewrap: a pair of unopened binoculars from the last Secret Santa. But as the group started to pick out gifts \\u2014 a unicorn neck pillow, pink sequined slippers, \\u201cAss Reaper\\u201d hot sauce (decorated with a little Grim Reaper mask) \\u2014 one by one, we realized these had all been rewrapped from our previous exchanges. The room howled with laughter, myself included. Finally, I got the joke. As we tossed around the junk, I felt seen by and close to my family in a way I thought only my gifting style could achieve, and living out Nana\\u2019s most important lesson: to never take life too seriously. It was as if I, too, had discovered in my rewrap a forgotten note from Nana telling me, as she always does: \\u201cHave fun, dear.\\u201d \", \"And so that\\u2019s what we do. Last year, I brought a partner home for Christmas for the first time. As I stewed over my rewrapped wine, I watched in trepidation as my mom passed him a gift, and he proceeded to open yet another rewrapped bottle of wine. Thankfully, he got the joke and laughed along. I was glad, because humor is my family\\u2019s love language, and the rewrap is our favorite inside joke. With a holiday season so often tainted by expectations of big bows and hefty price tags, the rewrap is a cherished antidote, a reminder of what matters most: a good laugh with the family. For us, saying \\u201cI got you\\u201d is like saying \\u201cI love you.\\u201d\", \"\"]","href_hash":"9c97964b5cc811ec9d251f7281e97d2c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9c97964b5cc811ec9d251f7281e97d2c"}},
