speaking at a press conference earlier this month and\\u00a0said while the idea of the virus vanishing was not possible, 2022 would be a year of \\\"recalibration\\\".\", \"All states and territories in Australia are now living with COVID-19 and \\u2014\\u00a0bar occasional snap lockdowns and lockouts in some\\u00a0Top End communities \\u2014 restrictions are, generally, being eased.\\u00a0\", \"While there's no such thing as a COVID crystal ball, this is what life could look like this year.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">An endemic virus</div>\", \"We are coming to the end of a COVID-19\\u00a0\\\"global health emergency\\\", according to the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO).\", \"Director-General\\u00a0Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says there are \\\"different scenarios\\\" as to how the acute phase of COVID will end but it could be\\u00a0achievable by the middle of the year if every country vaccinates 70 per cent of its population.\", \"However, Mr\\u00a0Ghebreyesus said it would be dangerous to assume \\\"we are in the endgame\\\" and stressed that living with the virus doesn't look like \\\"50,000 deaths a week from a preventable and treatable disease\\\".\", \"In Australia, the future is promising.\", \"Over the next six\\u00a0to 12 months our lives will be much less disrupted by the virus, predicts Christine Jenkins, the head of the respiratory group at the George Institute for Global Health.\", \"Professor Jenkins believes the virus will soon become endemic on the east coast of Australia\\u00a0(and many other developed countries) which means COVID occurs regularly, but it does not devastate the\\u00a0population.\", \"\\\"I think we can be optimistic even though we don't exactly know how the virus will behave,\\\" she says.\", \"\\\"Many people remain fearful but the evidence is that natural immunity added to vaccination is actually very good.\\\"\", \"<img

life\\\" ahead of us and COVID will be less disruptive.(Supplied: The George Institute for Global Health)</div>\", \"Moving to endemic status does not mean COVID becomes\\u00a0harmless.\", \"\\\"You can still have very, very serious outcomes from endemic diseases, for instance tuberculosis, malaria and HIV are still endemic in parts of the world and those diseases are still devastating,\\\" Professor Jenkins says.\", \"For this reason, all the habits we have adopted like social distancing and mask wearing will still play a role throughout 2022 and global travel won't look like it used to.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Accepting' COVID deaths</div>\", \"Australia will continue to see COVID-related deaths, particularly among\\u00a0the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.\", \"But authorities will need to determine how many deaths is too many, Professor Jenkins says.\", \"\\\"I do think we have to have a tolerance of death that we've been phobic about in this discussion,\\\" she says.\", \"\\\"It's\\u00a0sometimes regarded as lacking compassion if you talk about some deaths being acceptable, and so people don't want to say it, you know, even I'm reluctant to speak about it.\\\"\", \"But in the same\\u00a0way Australia accepts between 500 to 1,000 flu deaths each year, a number of COVID deaths will have to be \\\"accepted\\\".\", \"Professor Jenkins says health departments will most likely be modelling potential death rates\\u00a0for 2022 but she doesn't expect the estimations to be made public.\", \"This year, personal responsibility has replaced government mandates in most parts of Australia which means most\\u00a0people can decide\\u00a0what risks they are comfortable exposing themselves to.\", \"Many people are now free to travel overseas, attend large gatherings and no longer have to isolate after every exposure to COVID.\", \"This means people should focus more on their \\\"immune fitness\\\" this year, Professor Jenkins says.\", \"\\\"People will hopefully build up their general immune fitness ... this can be done in a number of ways including physical activity, adequate sleep and a healthy diet.\\\"\", \"\\\"People should also focus on their risk factors, particularly obesity which isn't mentioned enough when it comes to COVID.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">COVID pills</div>\", \"Later this year, Australians will be able to access\\u00a0anti-viral medications,\\u00a0taken in the form of a pill, that reduce the virus'\\u00a0ability to multiply.\\u00a0\", \"The prescription-only medicines are designed to be taken within a few days of the onset of symptoms.\", \"From next month two drugs \\u2014 Lagevrio, made by American pharmaceutical company Merck Sharpe & Dohme, and Paxlovid, by Pfizer \\u2014 will hit the shelves in Australia.\", \"The federal government has purchased a combined 800,000 courses of the pills which are\\u00a0best used by those\\u00a0who have mild to moderate COVID but are at risk of progressing to severe disease.\", \"Paul Griffin, who is the director of Infectious Diseases at Mater Health Services, says\\u00a0this marks a significant step forward in how we battle COVID.\", \"\\\"We have already been using antibody and antiviral therapy we can give intravenously [in hospitals] but the addition of safe and effective antivirals that can be given orally, in my opinion, will make an enormous difference,\\\" he said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b5c2599a4a056780ec753f0cdb37954a\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Paxlovid pills have been very popular in the US but demand often outstrips supply.(Pfizer via AP)</div>\", \"Paxlvoid targets a process in COVID replication that does not relate to the spike protein which means it will still be highly effective even when the virus mutates.\", \"But the pills have a drawback.\", \"\\\"Paxlovid is an expensive medicine and one that the Australian healthcare system cannot afford to supply to all Australians, says\\u00a0Andrew Rowland,\\u00a0Research Fellow in Clinical Pharmacology at Flinders University.\", \"\\\"[This means] vaccination remains our most important and cost effective means of fighting the pandemic.\\\"\", \"On top of this, the WHO\\u00a0has just recommended two new drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 \\u2014\\u00a0baricitinib and\\u00a0sotrovimab.\", \"The WHO found\\u00a0baricitinib improved survival and reduced the need for ventilation and\\u00a0sotrovimab reduced the risk of hospital admission for those with mild COVID, but at high risk.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">New vaccine technology</div>\", \"In a matter of weeks Australians will have access to a new vaccine which is made very differently to those already available.\", \"For this reason, experts hope it will encourage some unvaccinated people to roll up their sleeves.\", \"Novavax is a \\\"protein subunit\\\" vaccine which means it\\u00a0introduces a part of the COVID virus to the immune system but it doesn't contain any live components of the virus.\\u00a0\", \"This is different to the relatively new technology used in\\u00a0mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) or adenovirus vaccines (AstraZeneca), which some people have been hesitant to receive.\", \"\\\"There will be a small group of people who were reluctant to get the mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine, who may now go and get the Novavax vaccine,\\u00a0as it is a protein-based vaccine, similar in design to other non COVID-19 vaccines in use in Australia,\\\" says Dr\\u00a0Nicholas Wood from the Westmead Children's Hospital in Sydney's west.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f58dbfa5bd594b21998efae126288577\\\"

some vaccine inequality around the world.\", \"It can stored for nine months at standard refrigeration temperatures so\\u00a0has significant logistical advantages and experts hope it will reach low and middle income countries, where less than 10 per cent of people are vaccinated.\", \"\\\"The approval of Novavax and other protein-based vaccines will help to fill a void in the global pandemic response,\\\" says\\u00a0international health professor Jaya Dantas from Curtin University.\", \"\\\"Protein-based vaccines have inexpensive production protocols and logistical advantages, including stability at a range of temperatures and will help to narrow the immunisation gap between rich and poor countries.\\\"\", \"This year Australia will also likely approve Pfizer jabs for children aged\\u00a0between six\\u00a0months and five years old, with emergency authorisation already granted in the US.\", \"On top of all this, the race is still on for a universal variant-proof COVID vaccine which would have high efficacy against any mutation the virus throws up in the future.\", \"Vaccine researchers in Australia, Norway and the US are rapidly developing candidates and Australian teams hope there will be a \\\"holy grail\\\" vaccine by mid-2022.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">The possibility of new strains</div>\", \"The bad news is that Omicron will probably not be the last variant of concern we have to grapple with.\", \"New variants will undoubtedly keep emerging as they have throughout the pandemic but whether they will be more serious than Omicron is difficult to predict.\", \"Mutations can be neutral or occasionally favourable but it's more likely that won't be the case.\", \"\\\"The reality is that we don't see many viruses that evolve into something less deadly,\\\"\\u00a0said infectious diseases specialist Sanjaya Senanayake from the Australian National University.\", \"\\\"We could have just been lucky with Omicron and there is no guarantee that the next variant of concern won't be more deadly and perhaps just as infectious,\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Professor Jenkins believes a new strain could be the biggest disruptor to the evolution from pandemic to endemic and the only solution is getting more vaccines to poorer countries so the virus has less chance of running rampant and mutating.\", \"\\\"Before we keep on giving ourselves repeated doses of boosters, we should be getting the third world countries vaccinated first and then wait for a new universal COVID vaccine,\\\" he said.\", \"<img
