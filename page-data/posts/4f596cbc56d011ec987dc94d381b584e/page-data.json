It will initially have four production lines, each capable of making battery packs for 200,000 cars a year. The automaker, one of the world\\u2019s largest, hopes to eventually add two more lines, which would bring production capacity to packs for 1.2 million vehicles.\", \"\\u201cThe future of mobility is electrification,\\u201d Ted Ogawa, the chief executive of Toyota Motor North America, said in a statement. \\u201cNorth Carolina offers the right conditions for this investment, including the infrastructure, high-quality education system, access to a diverse and skilled work force, and a welcoming environment for doing business.\\u201d\", \"The plan, which will be outlined at a news conference later on Monday, is the latest signal traditional automakers are now betting that sales of electric vehicles will soar over the next decade and will begin to replace internal-combustion vehicles, which are major sources of the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change.\", \"In September, Ford Motor said it would spend $11.4 billion to build three battery plants and an electric truck factory in Kentucky and Tennessee.
