And where was her estranged husband, David Anthony? Did he send those texts pretending to be Gretchen to cover up her murder?\", \"Back in March 2020, friends and family of Gretchen Anthony were alarmed when they began receiving texts from her, saying she had tested positive for coronavirus.\", \"Kelly Hanna: You know, the news is saying it's serious. \\u2026 And then all of a sudden numbers are being reported and people are dying.\", \"It was hard for Gretchen Anthony's friends, like Kelly Hanna, to picture her dying of anything, much less this frightening virus.

Investigators wasted no time finding out.\", \"Chrichet Mixon: They force entry into the garage and there was no Gretchen inside. However, they noticed that there was a strong, pungent smell of a cleaning agent in the garage.\", \"With body cameras rolling, investigators searched the home several times. They found evidence suggesting a violent struggle: a broken picture frame, shards of glass on Gretchen's bed, and a stained towel.\", \"Chrichet Mixon: There was a piece of cloth that had what is what is referred to as BLS, a blood-like substance, on it.\", \"They got a huge break when they discovered neighbors had taken photos of a black Nissan pickup truck parked near Gretchen's home after the terrifying screams.\", \"Peter Van Sant: And who owns a black Nissan pickup truck?\", \"Det.

Jared Kenerson: Yes. \\u2026 Her phone was on the move.\", \"Chrichet Mixon: There's a lot of moving parts here, right? So, we're trying to still answer the question, where's Gretchen Anthony? \\u2026 Where is David Anthony?

One store owner shared a memorable conversation.\\u00a0\", \"Chrichet Mixon: That he came in wanting to sell some jewelry that had been left to him by a family member that had died from COVID-19.\", \"Peter Van Sant: COVID? \", \"Chrichet Mixon: Yes. \", \"Peter Van Sant: COVID strikes again in this case.\", \"Chrichet Mixon: COVID strikes again.\", \"Det. Jared Kenerson: And in all these videos that we were able to obtain from these different businesses, nowhere was Gretchen seen.\", \"While David Anthony was leaving a tantalizing trail of electronic breadcrumbs, he had one huge advantage.

We're trying to move quickly and play catch-up.\", \"Investigators tracked Gretchen's and David's cell phone signals, which appeared to place both phones travelling together \\u2014 heading westward across Texas.\", \"Peter Van Sant: Now, does that suggest the two of them \\u2026 may be on a trip together \\u2026 that she could possibly still be alive?\", \"Det. Jared Kenerson: It suggests that their phones are pinging together to me.\", \"Detective Jared Kenerson didn't know what happened to Gretchen, but feared the worst.
