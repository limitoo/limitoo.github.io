off Rhode Island. \\nPhoto: Australian National Maritime Museum\\n</div>\", \"Endeavour, which was scuttled in the harbour as part of the American War of Independence in 1788, has a prominent place in Australian history.\", \"In 1770 it became the first European vessel to reach the east coast.\", \"At an event in Sydney this morning, the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM) announced a wreck in Newport Harbour, off Rhode Island in the United States, had been confirmed as the ship.\", \"But an hour later, the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) stepped in, labelling the revelation a \\\"breach of contract\\\".\", \"The project's principal investigator Kathy Abbass said any conclusions would be \\\"driven by proper scientific process and not Australian emotions or politics\\\".\", \"\\\"What we see on the shipwreck site under study is consistent with what might be expected of the Endeavour, but there has been no indisputable data found to prove the site is that iconic vessel, and there are many unanswered questions that could overturn such an identification,\\\" Dr Abbass said.\", \"\\\"When the study is done, RIMAP will post the legitimate report on its website.\\\"\", \"Kieran Hosty, from the ANMM, claimed Dr Abbass had been sent a report 10 days ago outlining the museum's findings.\", \"\\\"I can't answer the question about breach of contract, as far as I'm aware the contract with the Rhode Island project expired in November last year.\", \"\\\"Going onto the actual jumping the gun that we haven't got enough information, I disagree with that.\\\"\", \"He said the wreck had several points \\\"which correspond to what we know about Endeavour.\\\"\", \"In making the initial announcement, ANMM director and CEO, Kevin Sumption, had a different perspective.\", \"\\\"I am satisfied that this is the final resting place of one of the most important and contentious vessels in Australia's maritime history,\\\" he said.\", \"Maritime archaeologists have been investigating several 18th century shipwrecks in a 2 square mile (5.2 square kilometres) area, known as RI 2394, since 1999.\", \"\\\"The last pieces of the puzzle had to be confirmed before I felt able to make this call,\\\" Sumption said.\", \"\\\"Based on archival and archaeological evidence, I'm convinced it's the Endeavour.\\\"\", \"Originally launched in 1764 as the Earl of Pembroke, four years later it was renamed Endeavour by Britain's Royal Navy.\", \"Over the next three years, the ship voyaged to the South Pacific, firstly on an astronomical mission to record the transit of Venus in Tahiti, before charting Australia's east coast and the coast of New Zealand in 1770.\", \"The vessel lay forgotten for more than two centuries, after it was sold to private owners and deliberately sunk in 1778 by British forces.\", \"While only 15 percent of the vessel remains, efforts are now focused on how to protect and preserve it.\", \"Researchers say several key markers distinguished Endeavour from four other ships sunk in Newport in August 1778:\", \"The research team are finalising their report on the site, which will be peer-reviewed and published in the months ahead.\", \"In making today's announcement, Sumption acknowledged his American counterparts.\", \"\\\"We pay tribute to the work of Dr Kathy Abbass and her team at the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project for their ongoing commitment to the site and its history,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"It's an important historical moment, as this vessel's role in exploration, astronomy and science applies not just to Australia, but also Aotearoa New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.\\\"\", \"Federal Arts Minister Paul Fletcher also spoke at this morning's announcement in Sydney.\", \"He also acknowledged his American counterparts.\", \"\\\"We pay tribute to the work of Dr Kathy Abbass and her team at the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project for their ongoing commitment to the site and its history,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"It's an important historical moment, as this vessel's role in exploration, astronomy and science applies not just to Australia, but also Aotearoa New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.\\\"\", \"To mark the occasion, an interactive website has also been launched featuring immersive videos, animation, underwater footage and photogrammetry data sets.\", \"-ABC\"]","href_hash":"2e448bba852411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2e448bba852411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
