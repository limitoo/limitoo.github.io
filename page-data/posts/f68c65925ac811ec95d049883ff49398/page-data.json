It was to be held at Zero Bond, the private club in NoHo where Mr. Adams has been known to fraternize into the night, particularly since winning the Democratic nomination in July.\", \"An array of New York interests had been seeking to curry good will with the incoming mayor by contributing to Mr. Adams\\u2019s committees. Among the canceled fund-raisers is one hosted by the New York Electrical Contractors Association and another by the Muslim community activist Debbie Almontaser, Mr. Thies said.\", \"But Mr. Adams has not canceled all of his events. He still plans to attend a Dec. 16 event hosted by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Mr. Thies said, but it is no longer a fund-raiser. Mr. Bloomberg endorsed Mr. Adams in the general election and the mayor-elect has leaned on the former mayor for advice.\", \"A spokesman for Zero Bond says the club doesn\\u2019t comment on events hosted by its members.\", \"The canceled Zero Bond event casts a spotlight on Mr. Adams\\u2019s abrupt arrival as a Manhattan power broker after a career in Brooklyn across the river from Manhattan\\u2019s elite. Mr. Torossian is a new friend who has helped introduce Mr. Adams to figures in the real estate and entertainment businesses, and crucially brought him to the exclusive Zero Bond, which Mr. Adams used as an informal transition headquarters.\", \"While many politicians carefully manage their relationships to avoid potential favor-seekers, conflicts of interest or simple embarrassment, Mr. Adams has thrown himself headfirst into the new circles his election has opened, even flying to Puerto Rico on a jet owned by the cryptocurrency investor Brock Pierce.\", \"But Mr. Torossian\\u2019s particularly controversial history, and his high profile at Mr. Adams\\u2019s side has drawn a wave of coverage, including an unflattering Daily Beast story that revisited some of Mr. Torossian\\u2019s controversial clients, several of them allies of former President Donald Trump, as well as his \\u201cstreet-brawler\\u201d style and profane emails.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s great Eric has hit his fund-raising goals and is oversubscribed,\\u201d Mr. Torossian said in a text message on Saturday. \\u201cHis pro-business, pro-police policies are what NYC needs.\\u201d\", \"None of the Adams aides who had sought to distance their boss from Mr. Torossian would speak for the record, perhaps because of his reputation as a tenacious enemy.\", \"Mr. Torossian purchased a website called Everything PR in 2014, the site\\u2019s former editor in chief, Paul Bulter, told The New York Times. A former 5WPR employee said Mr. Torossian operated the site, where he regularly promotes his firm\\u2019s work.\", \"For instance, under the headline \\u201cPornhub Is Necessary Viewing for PR Professionals,\\u201d one story concludes: \\u201cPornhub has brilliant PR. Their PR agency in the U.S. is 5WPR.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Torossian declined to comment on Everything PR.\", \"The site also attacks other PR firms with whom Mr. Torossian has clashed. After Ken Frydman, a New York public relations executive, won a contract that 5WPR had also sought, Mr. Frydman\\u2019s firm received a negative write-up on Everything PR, saying, \\u201cWe cannot in good faith recommend this agency.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI should sue Ronn for slander and defamation,\\u201d Mr. Frydman said. \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t have time to stand on that long line.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f68c65925ac811ec95d049883ff49398"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f68c65925ac811ec95d049883ff49398"}},
