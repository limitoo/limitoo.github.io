Today we\\u2019ll look at the investigation by the Manhattan district attorney\\u2019s office that is focusing on financial documents that Donald Trump and his company submitted when he applied for loans. We will also meet New York\\u2019s newest championship team.\", \"The prosecutors who are considering whether to charge Donald Trump with fraud are focusing on financial documents known as statements of financial condition. Trump presented the statements to Deutsche Bank and other potential lenders whenever he was looking for a loan for a hotel, a golf course or an office building. The documents could explain whether Trump inflated the value of his assets \\u2014 and whether he misled his own accountants, who prepared the statements based on information Trump and his employees provided.\", \"Prosecutors from the office of the district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., have drilled down on the information that Trump\\u2019s company gave the accounting firm, according to people with knowledge of questions that witnesses have been asked. Three of my colleagues \\u2014 William K. Rashbaum, Ben Protess and Jonah E. Bromwich \\u2014 write that if prosecutors seek an indictment, the case could turn on whether they can use the information to show in his dealings with his lenders, Trump\\u2019s penchant for hyperbole crossed the line into fraud.\", \"[Trump Fraud Inquiry\\u2019s Focus: Did He Mislead His Own Accountants?]\", \"Many businesses use statements of financial condition to record assets and liabilities. The public got a glimpse of Trump\\u2019s when his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen released them in 2019, when he testified to Congress. The statements, issued as of June 30 every year, contained optimistic projections about the value of Trump\\u2019s real estate business, along with disclaimers about the limitations of such information.\", \"The prosecutors, working with the office of the New York State attorney general, Letitia James, have looked into the possibility that Trump and his employees cherry-picked favorable information and ignored gloomy data.\", \"A spokeswoman for Trump\\u2019s accounting firm, Mazars USA, declined to comment beyond saying that it could not discuss its clients or its work for them without their consent, and that Mazars remained \\u201ccommitted to fulfilling all of our professional and legal obligations.\\u201d A lawyer for the firm, Jerry Bernstein, declined to elaborate.\", \"Trump did not assemble the data for the accountants personally, but the documents left no doubt about who was accountable for the content: \\u201cDonald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,\\u201d his accountants wrote in a cover letter attached to the statements in 2011 and 2012.\", \"Yet the accountants also acknowledged they \\u201chave not audited or reviewed\\u201d the information and \\u201cdo not express an opinion or provide any assurance about\\u201d it, a common caveat in statements of financial condition. The accountants disclosed that, while compiling the information for Trump, they had \\u201cbecome aware of departures from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\\u201d\", \"Given those caveats, Trump\\u2019s lawyers could argue that no one, let alone sophisticated lenders, should have taken his valuations at face value. They could also that the lenders conducted their own analyses and concluded that he was a worthy borrower.\", \"It\\u2019s mostly cloudy today in New York City, with light, variable wind in the morning and highs in the lower 50s. There is a chance of rain tonight.\", \"In effect until Dec. 24 (Christmas Eve).\", \"Eric Adams, the incoming mayor, is expected to name a new police commissioner today: Keechant Sewell, the chief of detectives in Nassau County. She will be the first woman appointed to the job and will take over the nation\\u2019s largest police force at a critical moment.\", \"Adams, in a statement, called her \\u201ca proven crime fighter with the experience and emotional intelligence to deliver both the safety New Yorkers need and the justice they deserve.\\u201d A person close to Adams said he had been impressed by Sewell\\u2019s confidence and competence, as well as her experience working undercover. Her interview process included a mock news conference about the shooting of an unarmed Black man by a white police officer, the person said.\", \"Sewell, 49, has spent 23 years with the Nassau Police Department, which has about 2,400 uniformed officers, less than a tenth of the 35,000 employed by the New York Police Department. Sewell has been viewed as a rising star in policing circles, said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which advises departments on best practices.\", \"Two developments to watch for today: A ban on gas-powered stoves, space heaters and hot-water tanks in new buildings, and an announcement about delivering packages to Manhattan on ferries.\", \"The ban on gas-powered devices is expected to be approved by the City Council. It would apply only to new buildings, effectively requiring developers to plan for electric heating and cooking. The ban would take effect in 2023 for buildings under seven stories and in 2027 for taller buildings.\", \"The ferry plan would reduce truck congestion in tunnels and bridges. The idea is for a dedicated NY Waterway ferry to bring containers loaded with packages to the Downtown Manhattan Heliport from freight terminals in Bayonne, N.J., and Red Hook in Brooklyn. The containers would then be hauled to drop-off points around Manhattan for delivery to the customers who had ordered them.\", \"A New York City team won a championship the other day.\", \"And you thought that had not happened since the Giants beat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI in 2012.\", \"The winning team was the New York City Football Club, one of the Metro area\\u2019s two Major League Soccer franchises. As my colleague Joel Petterson wrote, N.Y.C.F.C. survived a penalty-kick shootout, 4-2, on the way to defeating the Portland Timbers.\", \"N.Y.C.F.C. has worked to break through the New York sports landscape without a stadium to call its own. The team has passionate fans \\u2014 hundreds made it to Portland \\u2014 and the match did not go unnoticed at City Hall, where Mayor Bill de Blasio gave the players keys to the city on Tuesday.\", \"But the championship match did not generate the same electricity as a Super Bowl. One soccer fan, Bret Gessner, 39, said he had gone to a couple of bars on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on Saturday and had been surprised how little excitement there was. \\u201cNo one seemed to be bothered that New York was in a championship,\\u201d Gessner said. N.Y.C.F.C. \\u201ccompletely flew under the radar.\\u201d\", \"In tribute to a New York City institution, this week\\u2019s Metropolitan Diaries offers readers\\u2019 tales of encounters with Stephen Sondheim.\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"I was waiting for a crosstown bus on East 49th Street near Second Avenue the day before Thanksgiving on my way to see a matinee of \\u201cCompany.\\u201d\", \"Stephen Sondheim\\u2019s townhouse is across the street, and I noticed that the blinds in the second-story window were open. I don\\u2019t know why, but I felt moved to get a better look.\", \"I crossed the street and was on the sidewalk just beneath that window when I saw Mr. Sondheim suddenly swing around in a chair and wave.\", \"Reflexively, I waved back.\", \"I realized later that he had probably been trying to get the attention of the driver of the Lincoln Town Car that had just pulled up. It all happened so fast. I had walked past his house many times in the 30 years I had lived in the neighborhood, and nothing like this had ever happened before.\", \"I went back to the bus stop. The driver locked the car and walked up the block. And Mr. Sondheim disappeared into his house.\", \"\\u2014 Christina Clarke\", \"Illustrated by Agnes Lee.
