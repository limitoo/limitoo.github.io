I\\u2019ll be knocking down my shopping list for Thanksgiving this weekend, with stops at the big market for dry goods and the tiny little one for the most perfect brussels sprouts and winter squash. I\\u2019ll visit the wine shop for Brouilly and Prosecco, the fishmonger for oysters, and the farm that raises the birds I cook each year, fat and glistening, animals that have had only one bad day in their lives. I\\u2019ll load the refrigerator and the pantry. I\\u2019ll consider my place settings. I\\u2019ll get in the right head to cook next week with abandon and joy.\", \"And I\\u2019ll make a few pies for the freezer, so I don\\u2019t have to worry about them on the day itself. That\\u2019s exciting this year because Melissa Clark has spent the last six months tweaking her recipes to deliver instructions for brand-new but still absolutely classic Thanksgiving pies: pumpkin, apple and pecan (above). (I can\\u2019t wait to make the pecan in particular, heavy on the nuts and much less so on the goo.) Read those recipes closely, then go watch Melissa make them on our YouTube channel, then make them yourselves.\", \"More planning for the future: Hanukkah\\u2019s coming hot on the heels of Thanksgiving. You may want to start getting ready, and we\\u2019ve certainly got a lot of recipes to consider. I do love the idea of Joan Nathan\\u2019s sweet-and-sour brisket following a Thanksgiving turkey by just a few days. That\\u2019s very land of plenty!\", \"But, against the backdrop of all of this thinking about what\\u2019s coming, do make plans to cook for yourself today. When was the last time you made smash burgers, for instance, or put together a hot dog party, or assembled a platter of nachos? This could be a cool weekend for vegan tantanmen with pan-fried tofu, for three sisters stew, for a Guinness pie.\", \"Remember: Thanksgiving\\u2019s going to go just fine. You can take some time this weekend to make a cheesy pan pizza from scratch.\", \"Thousands and thousands more recipes for Thanksgiving and to cook this weekend are waiting for you on New York Times Cooking. It\\u2019s true that you need a subscription in order to access them, but we think it\\u2019s worth the scratch. Plenty of people agree, and now may be the very best time to join us. Thanks so much.\", \"As ever, we will be standing by, just in case something goes awry in your kitchen or with our technology. Just write: cookingcare@nytimes.com. Someone will get back to you. Or if you\\u2019d like to send us an apple or a worm, you can reach me directly at foodeditor@nytimes.com. I read every letter sent.\", \"Now, it\\u2019s a very far cry from anything to do with the blanching of vegetables or the proper way to skin an eel, but I somehow ended up reading \\u201cThe Museum of Extinct Animals,\\u201d by Benjamin Myers in Somesuch Stories. Bracing.\", \"It\\u2019s the chef Rocco DiSpirito\\u2019s birthday. He\\u2019s 55, and I\\u2019m reminded of the time the Times writer Jonathan Reynolds, who died recently, met with him and other chefs to talk about the future of fast food. DiSpirito\\u2019s offering: The Rocco roll.\", \"You\\u2019ll need to register to read it, but Lauren Groff\\u2019s consideration of the Danish writer Dorthe Nors, in The New York Review of Books, is absolutely worth the time.\", \"Finally, here\\u2019s Lisa Hannigan singing \\u201cUndertow\\u201d with Loah and Kevin Murphy at the National Gallery of Ireland in May, 2020. Listen to that while you\\u2019re deciding which pie you\\u2019ll make first. I\\u2019ll see you on Sunday.\"]","href_hash":"ccff6766495611ec8d6899bfb6d9e253"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ccff6766495611ec8d6899bfb6d9e253"}},
