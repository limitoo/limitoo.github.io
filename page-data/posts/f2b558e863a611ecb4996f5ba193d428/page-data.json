Peat fires are burning underground in the wetland.\", \"Forest and Bird Northland conservation manager Dean Baigent-Mercer said ecologically, it was a \\\"catastrophic disaster\\\".\", \"A dozen plant species in the Far North township were already on the verge of extinction before the fire, Baigent-Mercer said.\", \"\\\"There are ferns that are really close to extinction, there's a tiny little mistletoe that grows on k\\u0101nuka, and there are orchids.\", \"\\\"One of the orchids hasn't even been named by scientists yet and there's only one photograph of it in flower, in the world.\\\"\", \"The wetland is one of Te Tai Tokerau's \\\"natural wonders\\\", he said.\", \"\\\"There's Northland mudfish, which obviously only live up here.
