In brackets next to each player's name was the standard description of her role: \\\"wicketkeeper\\\", \\\"spin bowler\\\", \\\"fast bowler\\\", etc. Betty Wilson's read: \\\"Australia's best all-rounder\\\".\", \"Wilson, born in Melbourne 100 years ago today, was soon described as the world's best. \\\"The female Bradman\\\" also stuck, although as cliches go, it lacked Wilson's trademark precision: unlike The Don, she was lethal with the ball and in the field, closer to Bradman and Keith Miller combined; the discrepancies in adulation and riches were and remain obvious.\", \"Perhaps the term 'all-rounder' even sold her short, bracketing her with players merely proficient in more than one facet of the game. Like Sir Garfield Sobers, Wilson could lay claim to uncommon brilliance in three departments \\u2014 dashing and correct batting, penetrative off-spin and fielding described as peerless in the women's game.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/064cdc9c9820b60587fa448bd9b04d03\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Wilson in the practice nets at Lord's in 1951 - she was the first player to achieve the double of 10 wickets and a century in a Test.(Getty Images: S&G/PA Images)</div>\", \"It was an eye-catching throw that set her on her cricket journey. At 10, watching the Collingwood Ladies team play, she zinged errant balls back to the keeper and was drafted immediately into the team. At that tender age, she made 25 not out in their grand final.\", \"Results flowed from a total devotion to the game \\u2014 daily training and the arrangement of work commitments around playing ones \\u2014 until every movement was exacting.\", \"\\\"I had the action of a medium-pace bowler,\\\" she told Cricinfo.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/35059f4ff71a26e1d438d542fc4853ad\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Wilson played 11 Tests in her career, taking 68 wickets\\u00a0with a bowling average of 11.80.(Supplied: Australian Cricket Society)</div>\", \"In 1938, she was a Victorian representative at just 16. War delayed her Test bow by a decade. At 36, she played the last of 11 Tests for 862 runs at 57.46 and 68 wickets at a startling 11.8. There is a statistical column for her catching but not her unprecedented throwing.\", \"With sister Gwen, Wilson played for the Clarendon club in Melbourne's pennant competition. The sense of expectation that accompanied Wilson to the crease in those games is seen in descriptions of an innings against Collingwood in 1954. Wilson cracked 140 runs, 94 of them from boundaries. By Betty's standards, a newspaperman figured, it was merely \\\"solid\\\".\", \"Too few witnessed the feats that established her legend: 90 runs and 10 wickets on Test debut at the Basin Reserve; the first women's Test hat-trick; or when she became the first player, man or woman, to achieve the double of 10 wickets and a century in a Test.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'She literally danced around the wicket'</div>\", \"Bradman, in fact, saw Wilson play a Test \\u2014 at the Adelaide Oval, during the 1958 series against England. Faith Thomas, a trailblazer in myriad respects herself, remembered eyeing Sir Donald as just another bloke out to \\\"poo-poo women's cricket\\\" until Wilson unleashed a flurry of shots.\", \"\\\"Everything went for four and God knows what,\\\" Thomas said in 2016.\", \"Wilson made 127 that day, then took off her pads and claimed 6-71 from 49 overs.\", \"It would be understating the attitudes of those times to say that women's cricket was not universally respected by others. Reports from the 1949 Adelaide Test note the air of derision among 9,159 fans who showed up on day one.\", \"Australia was 2-3 within minutes of play commencing. Men scoffed. Wilson, in her second Test, strode to the middle in her signature wide-brimmed hat and pummelled England's bowlers to every corner of the ground. After 111 in 189 minutes \\u2014 the country's first Ashes century, and half Australia's total \\u2014 she departed to a \\\"unique ovation\\\".\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/67e08e16edf96445f8c57e20cd88f175\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Don Bradman saw Wilson play at Adelaide Oval in 1958, and was said to be 'tickled pink' by her skill.(Supplied:\\u00a0Australian Cricket Society)</div>\", \"Before that day was done, Wilson took the first of what ended up six wickets for 23 from 26.5 overs. England batter Hazel Sanders walked off with a chipped tooth. Few were prepared to poo-poo what they'd seen. Indeed, the next day, Wilson denied herself more wickets with a diving catch and side-on run-out only she could have pulled off. Gate takings were handsome. The players saw none.\", \"Wilson's best, by her own account, was saved for her last Ashes series. In the first innings of the second Test at St Kilda, when Australia was skittled for 38 on a soggy pitch, laughter was heard in the English camp. Thirty overs later the tourists were all out for 35, Wilson's lethal 7-7 containing her historic hat-trick.\", \"Making a mockery of the conditions, she then peeled off a century \\u2014 26 runs more than England's second innings, in which Wilson added four more wickets for a match analysis of 11-16 from 29 eight-ball overs. The batting summary for that Test was Wilson \\u2014 112, England \\u2014 111, but the game was a draw.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Two spurned marriage proposals</div>\", \"What was she like? At Wilson's Australian Cricket Hall of Fame induction in 2017, former Test star Mel Jones suggested a character far more like Miller than Bradman, saying Wilson was a straight-shooter who loved chardonnay and punting, and never felt the need to be tied down.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/21fd089c51ee2976601dd2915a79d410\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Wilson was far more interested in touring with her cricket team than domestic duties.(Getty Images: S&G/PA Images)</div>\", \"It is often said that she spurned two marriage proposals to maintain her commitment to cricket. She did actually accept one engagement, to a cricket umpire named Batchelor. It didn't end in tears after a dodgy LBW decision. For Betty, cricket tours appealed far more than home duties.\", \"In 2018, a campaign for a Wilson statue, led by broadcaster Angela Pippos, was backed by Jones and fellow cricket great Belinda Clark, but progress stalled.\", \"Whispers suggested that a stumbling block at the MCG, whose outskirts are overladen with bronzed male legends, is that honorees need to have performed with distinction at, and have a \\\"strong connection\\\" with, the ground itself.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a2e4756a47399df941b0f6282dbb2b57\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Wilson playing against Kent\\u00a0at Sevenoaks, at the start of the Australian Women's Cricket Team tour of England in 1951.(Getty Images: Dennis Oulds/Central Press/Hulton Archive)</div>\", \"Wilson can hardly be blamed that only one major match of her career was played there. It was the 1949 Test against England. She took six wickets, notched 100 runs and would have scored more if she hadn't felt compelled to push the game along when everyone else was content to let it peter out. She wasn't one for a draw.\", \"On Wednesday December 1, the daughter of a Clifton Hill bootmaker will be feted at Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club, on the ritzier side of Melbourne. The Betty Wilson Centenary Luncheon is hosted by the Australian Cricket Society, to whom Wilson gave a charming address in 2005 \\u2014 the year she was presented her long overdue baggy green.\", \"Five years later, like Bradman before her, she fell short of one last century to please the stattos.
