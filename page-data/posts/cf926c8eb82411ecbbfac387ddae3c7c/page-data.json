We look forward to it.\\\"\", \"Connor said he was \\\"thrilled and honored to be up here.\\\"\", \"\\\"Thanks to SpaceX, phenomenal ride. Thanks to Axiom for making this dream come true. Thanks to NASA, thanks to all the crew. We're here to experience this, but we understand there's a responsibility, and the responsibility is for this first civilian crew to get it right.\", \"\\\"And that's what we're fully committed to. ... It's going to be a   busy week of research for us, and I'm sure it's going to fly by.\\\"\", \"Summed up Pathy: \\\"Wow, it's just amazing to be here. It's hard to find the words, but it's been an amazing journey.\\\"\", \"So far, Axiom Space has booked four Crew Dragon flights through SpaceX, launching the first mission, Ax-1, on Friday. It is the first fully commercial, non-government flight to the International Space Station.\", \"Over the course of nearly 10 docked days, the Ax-1 crew plans to carry out 25 privately developed experiments, carry out technology demonstrations and Earth observation and participate in public outreach sessions. They are expected to undock on April 19 and return to an ocean splashdown, weather permitting.\", \"For Axiom, the flight represents a major step toward the goal of launching multiple modules to the space station, starting in late 2024, to serve as a commercial research facility. When the ISS is retired at the end of the decade, Axiom plans to separate its linked modules to serve as a free-flying commercial space station.\", \"Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News. He covered 129 space shuttle missions, every interplanetary flight since Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune and scores of commercial and military launches.
