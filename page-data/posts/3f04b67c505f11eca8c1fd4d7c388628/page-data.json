It just goes to show, horror is what scares you, not me.\", \"Horror has always been an elastic and regenerative genre. It lifts from and melds with just about every type of cinema: comedy, sci-fi, action, romance, fantasy, documentary. Its flexibility extends as far back as the monstrous love story in \\u201cBride of Frankenstein\\u201d (1935) and as current as the blood-drenched melodrama of \\u201cMalignant.\\u201d\", \"But how do you know if you\\u2019re watching a horror movie when there\\u2019s no killer or monster, exorcism or blood? It\\u2019s a decades-old question that\\u2019s being asked about new films that blur the line between a movie with horror and a horror movie.\", \"Among them are \\u201cThe Humans,\\u201d Stephen Karam\\u2019s darkly comic family drama set during a Thanksgiving dinner; \\u201cThe Lost Daughter,\\u201d Maggie Gyllenhaal\\u2019s forthcoming eerie character study of a college professor at a Greek resort who becomes obsessed with a fellow vacationer and her daughter; and perhaps unexpectedly, \\u201cSpencer,\\u201d Pablo Larra\\u00edn\\u2019s speculative, dream-logic psychodrama about Princess Diana.\", \"The film follows an unsettled Princess of Wales (Kristen Stewart) as she spends a Christmas holiday on the precipice of a madness that may not be real. In his review for The New York Times, A.O. Scott called it a Christmas movie, psychological thriller, romance and \\u201ca horror movie about a fragile woman held captive in a spooky mansion, tormented by sadistic monsters and their treacherous minions.\\u201d\", \"Read reviews and these films sound like Shudder originals. In the Times, the critic Jeannette Catsoulis used the words \\u201cmonstrous,\\u201d \\u201cdespairing,\\u201d \\u201ceerie,\\u201d \\u201csinister\\u201d to describe \\u201cThe Humans,\\u201d concluding that the family was stuck in a haunted house. IndieWire said the drama \\u201cblurs the line between Chekhov and Polanski \\u2014 Broadway and Blumhouse,\\u201d and is \\u201cthe first real horror movie about 9/11.\\u201d (Two of the family members were at ground zero that morning.) The Guardian said \\u201cThe Lost Daughter\\u201d tells the story of a woman who \\u201chaunts the resort like a ghost while other ghosts are haunting her.\\u201d\", \"For some directors, positioning the word \\u201chorror\\u201d anywhere near a film they don\\u2019t consider a horror movie would be erroneous or provocation. Not Karam. He was riveted by horror movies as a child in Scranton, Pa.; his gateway drug was the Disney ghost story \\u201cThe Watcher in the Woods\\u201d (1980), with Bette Davis as the owner of an English mansion who\\u2019s mourning her missing daughter.\", \"Now 42, Karam remains a devout horror fan, citing Kubrick and Polanski as inspirations for \\u201cThe Humans,\\u201d which he directed and adapted for the screen from his 2016 Tony-winning play. Karam takes pride in the film\\u2019s horror elements because they help viewers visualize \\u201chow people are conquering or coping with their fears in a story that\\u2019s scary.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s important for me to think of a film or a play or any story I\\u2019m telling as having a strong, confident personality,\\u201d Karam said in a video interview. \\u201cI don\\u2019t get bogged down by whether it\\u2019s a horror film or family drama because the definitions can upset people who take ownership of what a horror film is.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe Humans\\u201d takes place in a seen-better-days duplex newly occupied by Brigid (Beanie Feldstein) and her boyfriend, Richard (Steven Yeun). Visiting from Scranton are Brigid\\u2019s working-class parents, Erik and Deirdre (Richard Jenkins and Jayne Houdyshell); and Momo, Erik\\u2019s mother (June Squibb), who has dementia. Also joining is Brigid\\u2019s sister, Aimee (Amy Schumer), who lives in Philadelphia and is fresh off a breakup with her girlfriend.\", \"At the family table there\\u2019s turkey and good-natured ribbing, but also difficult conversations about work, love and depression. This is a family filled with love, but also resentment and heartache. Typical Thanksgiving drama stuff.\", \"But from the start, there\\u2019s an uneasy feeling, as if something terrible is on its way. Parts of the walls ooze and bubble with pustules like growths on a David Cronenberg mutant. There are eerie portraits of spooky people, like the art from a possessed castle in a Hammer Film. Jump scares, loud sounds, darkness, stillness: They\\u2019re all heart-pounding. Horror movie stuff.\", \"So what is a horror movie? It comes down to intent, said Wickham Clayton, a film scholar and the editor of \\u201cStyle and Form in the Hollywood Slasher Film.\\u201d Horror movies, he said, are about audiences \\u201cbeing uncomfortable, unsettled and disturbed.\\u201d\", \"Sometimes all it takes is a terrifying antagonist or mood, not an entire movie. Think of Robert Mitchum as a scoundrel preacher in the nightmare fairy tale \\u201cThe Night of the Hunter\\u201d (1955); Faye Dunaway as a toxic Joan Crawford in the darkly camp \\u201cMommie Dearest\\u201d (1981); or Robert De Niro as the time-bomb Travis Bickle in \\u201cTaxi Driver\\u201d (1976).\", \"Are they horror movies? Not quite. Are they scary? You bet.\", \"\\u201cIn each of these movies, there are moments, scenes and sequences that are so precisely and skillfully designed to make us feel unsettled, horrified and afraid,\\u201d Clayton said. \\u201cWe are made to feel this way even if there is nothing obvious onscreen, or as far as we know offscreen, to be afraid of.\\u201d\", \"What else is scary about \\u201cThe Humans\\u201d and \\u201cSpencer\\u201d? They\\u2019re both set during winter holidays. Andrew Scahill, an assistant professor of film at the University of Colorado, Denver, said that wasn\\u2019t a coincidence: for many people, family reunions and shame-filled year-end assessments are terrifying. It\\u2019s no wonder that in his class on Christmas cinema he includes both the feel-good movie musical \\u201cWhite Christmas\\u201d (1954) and the harrowing proto-slasher \\u201cBlack Christmas\\u201d (1974).\", \"\\u201cSome genres are more elastic than others,\\u201d said Scahill, the author of \\u201cThe Revolting Child in Horror Cinema.\\u201d \\u201cA mystery is predicated on surprising its audience,\\u201d he explained. \\u201cA rom-com wants to fulfill every expectation and not violate the contract of genre. Horror forces itself to keep innovating.\\u201d\", \"This conversation about definitions will continue, and that\\u2019s a good thing, as young filmmakers take horror in unexpected directions and forge new shape-shifting films. When \\u201cScream\\u201d (1996), \\u201cThe Blair Witch Project\\u201d (1999) and \\u201cGet Out\\u201d (2017) each made waves, they were saying: It\\u2019s time for a jolt.\", \"Another reason this discussion isn\\u2019t going anywhere is that the old debates still have legs. Look what happened earlier this year when the writer Elle Hunt tweeted, \\u201cHorror cannot be set in space,\\u201d and horror fans got all kinds of irate, responding with examples like \\u201cAlien\\u201d (1979) and \\u201cJason X\\u201d (2001).\", \"\\u201cHorror,\\u201d the writer Cory McCullough tweeted, \\u201ccan be anything.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3f04b67c505f11eca8c1fd4d7c388628"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3f04b67c505f11eca8c1fd4d7c388628"}},
