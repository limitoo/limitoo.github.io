The news came as a shock to many of his collaborators, among them artists, musicians and designers. It also devastated admirers who saw in him a tremendous talent and an industry leader.\", \"For many aspiring fashion designers, Mr. Abloh was a role model, proof that a Black man could ascend to one of the highest seats in luxury without ever conforming to a traditional notion of what \\u201cluxury\\u201d should mean.\", \"Xander Evans, 24, was visiting New York from Virginia when he stopped by the Off-White store to honor Mr. Abloh \\u2014 the \\u201cultimate designer,\\u201d in his words.\", \"\\u201cMy dream is to open up a sneaker and clothing store,\\u201d Mr. Evans said. \\u201cHe was one of the front-runners for people who look like me in the fashion industry, so it means something to me as a Black man.\\u201d\", \"Nour Sassine, 25, a fashion and textile designer in Beirut, had been shopping at Acne Studios next door when she noticed the altar outside Off-White. \\u201cHe created a lot of hope for younger designers to make it,\\u201d she said.\", \"One man walked up to the storefront with a white-out pen and wrote \\u201cVIRGIL\\u201d in small letters with a heart beneath the designer\\u2019s name. About 30 minutes later, a woman covered the heart with a red logo sticker.\", \"Maggy Rogow, who was standing with her dog and watching the woman, ripped the sticker off. \\u201cI just looked it up, and it has nothing to do with Virgil,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt was her own brand or something. Just self-promotion.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Rogow, a 33-year-old graduate student who used to work in fashion, said that Mr. Abloh represented a change in the industry that \\u201cneeded to happen\\u201d for people of color. She added that she wished she could have seen his future creations.\", \"\\u201cHis influence on so many different industries, whether it be music, fashion, art, is huge,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe will leave a legacy, and it\\u2019s just absolutely tragic that he was taken so soon and really young. He really lived for every moment.\\u201d\", \"Jose Tejeda, a 31-year-old New Yorker, pulled up outside the store in a white BMW and left a bouquet of red roses on the sidewalk. When asked what Mr. Abloh\\u2019s work meant to him, he said it was too hard to put into words.\", \"\\u201cIt hits home because I\\u2019m a fan of him always setting that bar,\\u201d Mr. Tejada said. He worried about who could possibly fill such a role now. \\u201cEspecially as a Black man breaking down that door. Creative director at Louis Vuitton? That\\u2019s huge.\\u201d\", \"The mood was quiet and the crowds that formed were small, but many paused for a few moments to observe the growing display and take photos and videos on their phones. Some drove by slowly in their cars to catch a glimpse of the scene. At one point, \\u201cTouch the Sky,\\u201d by Kanye West, began playing from the speakers of Galli, a restaurant nearby \\u2014 a coincidentally fitting song, given Mr. West\\u2019s longtime relationship with Mr. Abloh.\", \"Chanan Lalmi, a 17-year-old model who appeared in a 2019 Instagram campaign for Em Pty Gallery, was there with his father. \\u201cI\\u2019m shocked and very sad,\\u201d he said in French that was translated by his father. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t think that would happen to Virgil.\\u201d\", \"Connor Garrett, 28, arrived at the store wearing various Off-White pieces (he noted that he works in tech so that he can \\u201cafford to buy fashion\\u201d) and with a bouquet of roses. He said he had been following Mr. Abloh\\u2019s career since 2012.\", \"\\u201cHe changed the way people think about clothing,\\u201d Mr. Garrett said. \\u201cI think he influenced a whole generation, and I think it\\u2019s safe to say that he is the most influential artist of our generation.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ee87cfdf51ff11ec93ff2f8b56d81528"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ee87cfdf51ff11ec93ff2f8b56d81528"}},
