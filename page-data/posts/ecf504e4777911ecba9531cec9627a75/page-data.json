epicentre near Tonga, but its impact was felt right around the Pacific and, indeed, around the other side of the world.\", \"When the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha'apai volcano erupted on Saturday, it caused\\u00a0a plume of ash, steam and gas to rise like a mushroom above the blue Pacific waters.\", \"It lead to\\u00a0tsunami warnings and evacuation orders in several countries, and
