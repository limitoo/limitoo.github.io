Sasa and his parents escaped to Germany, and while he was allowed to stay and begin a career as a writer, they were forced to move on to the United States. \\u201cWe shattered along with Yugoslavia,\\u201d Stanisic writes, \\u201cand have not yet been able to put ourselves back together again.\\u201d\", \"The original German title of the novel is Herkunft, a term that can mean place of birth, ancestry or pedigree. For Stanisic, as with many refugees, there is no simple way to tell the story of one\\u2019s origins. The narrator composes lists of what he had as a child: parakeets; headaches; the scarf from his beloved soccer team, Red Star Belgrade, now cheered by many right-wing Serbian nationalists. He revisits Oskorusa, the village in Bosnia where his ancestors are buried, schnapps flows freely and a horned viper threatens to transform into the sinister dragons of Slavic folklore. He also recalls his teenage years in an immigrant enclave outside of Heidelberg, Germany, where, for a few years, he felt like \\u201ca completely normal kid in a completely normal time in a completely normal city.\\u201d\", \"Rather than trying to weave these stories into a coherent account, Stanisic jumbles genres to reflect how compromised memory is. \\u201cWhere You Come From\\u201d has its share of quirky, half-true anecdotes of the kind one expects from a memoir. It is hard to forget the audacious great-aunt Zagorka, who becomes a Soviet military pilot and sends her goat into space, or the aptly named Dr. Heimat (\\u201chomeland\\u201d), a German dentist who fixes all the immigrant mouths in the neighborhood, even those without insurance. At one point, the book turns into a Choose Your Own Adventure story; to understand the fickleness of life, after all, the reader needs to hit a few dead ends. But Stanisic\\u2019s lightness only makes tragedy more devastating when it comes.\", \"No memory is untouched by the war. Echoing the way his grandmother Kristina slips unwittingly from one decade to another, Stanisic often compresses past, present and future into a single scene. A sensuous recollection of a grill party outside the health spa in Visegrad, Bosnia \\u2014 lamb on the spit oozing fat, mothers laughing over wine, hide-and-seek in the mossy woods \\u2014 ends in a chilling detail: \\u201cTwo years later dozens of Muslim women would be taken to the Visegrad health spa, raped and killed.\\u201d Nor can the narrator truly return to Bosnia. In 2009, a relative\\u2019s television set, decorated with crocheted doilies and framed photographs of war criminals, is a reminder that once innocence is lost, it stays lost.\", \"Damion Searls\\u2019s translation does justice to Stanisic\\u2019s dry wit and linguistic playfulness, and captures the tense undercurrents building throughout the book. Though shot through with trauma, \\u201cWhere You Come From\\u201d is also funny and moving, particularly the scenes from Heidelberg. The teenage Sasa hangs out with other migrant kids on the \\u201cneutral ground\\u201d of the local gas station, takes a class in photorealist painting to impress a redhead who does not show up, and envies the genteel households of his German-born friends, where \\u201ceveryone let each other finish talking.\\u201d Ordinary and accidental, this is the quiet beauty of immigrant life.\"]","href_hash":"d9306819577b11ec9e4921f6dab68d9f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d9306819577b11ec9e4921f6dab68d9f"}},
