globally\\u00a0from air pollution every year, according to new modelling by international and Australian researchers.\", \"In a study published today in Nature Communications, researchers found air pollution attributable to the production of goods consumed in G20 nations caused almost half of all global deaths linked to exposure to particulate matter known as PM2.5.\", \"It's estimated about 4 million people die prematurely every year from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and cancer caused by particulate emissions, which are mostly generated by environmental pollution.\", \"\\\"Most deaths are in developing countries, and without international coordination the situation will worsen,\\\" said lead author Keisuke Nansai from the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Japan.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ed61513228c254fecc0c4c5f4bdcf3e7\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> \\\"Made in China\\\" might be cheap, but it's coming with a human cost, according to researchers.(China Daily via Reuters)</div>\", \"Currently, international PM2.5 measurements \\u2014\\u00a0and associated targets \\u2014\\u00a0are focused on individual countries' direct emissions, and the health impacts of those emissions on their populations and neighbouring regions.\", \"But the study shows that in many cases, PM2.5 levels are being driven by consumption in distant, often wealthy nations, for whom the negative health effects are negligible, said sustainability researcher and co-author Manfred Lenzen.\", \"\\\"If you look at things in your house \\u2014\\u00a0clothes, kitchen items, anything really \\u2014\\u00a0you\\u2019ll see a lot of them are made in China,\\\" said Professor Lenzen of the University of Sydney.\", \"\\\"The factories where these things are made, they emit [PM2.5] and they pollute ... and in turn cause respiratory disease.\", \"\\\"That\\u2019s sort of the causal chain of events.\\\"\", \"The authors of the study argue that G20 nations, which represent more than three quarters of international trade and the world's economic output, should take responsibility for their global PM2.5 footprint, rather than just their own domestic production.\", \"The study found production in Australia had\\u00a0contributed to\\u00a01.1 per cent of foreign deaths from PM2.5 emissions.\", \"But our overall consumption footprint meant\\u00a082 per cent of the deaths we were responsible for occurred overseas, with China suffering the most from Australia's consumption.\", \"The study found that overall, the lifetime consumption of 28 people in G20 nations will cause the premature death of one person worldwide.\", \"\\\"At the moment, [countries]\\u00a0do not address emissions that happen elsewhere and are caused as a result of their imports because it's not in their mandate \\u2026 and that's a problem,\\\" Professor Lenzen said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Calculating a nation's global footprint</div>\", \"To quantify each nation's global footprint, the researchers looked at air pollution levels and associated health impacts in 199 countries, and linked this to the trade and consumption of goods in G20 nations.\", \"They found that in 2010, consumption in G20 nations resulted in 1.98 million premature deaths globally from air pollution \\u2014\\u00a0a figure they said was unlikely to have fallen in the decade since.\", \"Of these deaths, more than 78,000 occurred in infants.\", \"China, India, the US, Russia and Indonesia were found to have the largest premature mortality footprints, and in all countries except the US, the majority of mortalities occurred within their own borders.\", \"But overall, 13 G20 nations, including Australia, had global mortality footprints that exceeded the number of premature deaths caused locally by pollution from their own production emissions.\", \"Professor\\u00a0Lenzen\\u00a0said although some G20 countries were \\\"cleaning up\\\" their own economies, they were often still outsourcing emissions-heavy production to other countries.\", \"\\\"Instead of producing it at home and polluting our own air, we're just shifting that problematic production offshore,\\\" Professor Lenzen said.\", \"\\\"Only if you adopt a global footprint method [to measure emissions] \\u2026 can you see the true picture.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/4080d81aa08aa136f7fc99ec2ac91b71\\\"

said the way PM2.5 emissions were currently calculated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\\u00a0shifted the responsibility away from countries who are, at least in part, at fault.\", \"\\\"Emissions targets are drawn up based on emissions that stem from [a country's] own territory \\u2026 but these emissions are, up to a third, influenced by international trade,\\\" he said.\", \"But high PM2.5 emitters like China couldn't escape responsibility either, he said.\", \"\\\"In both ways, you could say: [the consumer is] responsible for demanding this, but the producer is also responsible because they could produce it in cleaner way,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Probably a shared responsibility approach is more realistic, where consumers and producers work together \\u2026 so that emissions can be tackled not just from one point of view, but from both.\", \"\\\"The producer can work to clean up the production chains, and the consumer can consider demand-side measures, like behavioural change.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d1e4390b19732ce85cb50c5480d98462\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Researchers

scientist Paul Beggs from Macquarie University, who was not involved in the study, said the research was comprehensive and had \\\"far reaching implications\\\".\", \"\\\"By quantifying the number of premature deaths due to consumption-related particulate air pollution, the article makes it clear which countries have responsibility for this avoidable loss of life,\\\" said Dr Beggs.\", \"\\\"Within the broader Australian community, we've heard about the work conditions overseas in low-income countries, so people are possibly aware of the consequences of their consumer choices in that sense.\", \"\\\"But they probably haven't thought about the consequences of particulate pollution.\\\"\", \"Dr Beggs said although the study focused on PM2.5 pollution, it bolstered arguments for

reduce both greenhouse gases and particulate air pollution.\", \"\\\"If anything, [the study] probably understates the health consequences of consumer choices, because it's just focusing on
