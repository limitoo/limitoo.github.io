A recent TikTok revealed one answer.\", \"The video, posted by a nightclub in the UK, showed what items were left behind at closing time\\u2014and viewers couldn't get enough. So far, the clip, found here, has generated over 7.9 million views, 684,000 likes, and 2,800 comments.\", \"The clip falls into a broader category of workplace TikToks, as the platform has become a hub for creators to \\\"expose\\\" the hidden, obscured, strange, and otherwise interesting aspects of their seemingly-normal jobs. Fast food restaurants, for example, have become a popular topic within this genre: most recently, it was reported that a TikTok from late October, showing how a McDonald's McRib sandwich is made, had been viewed about ten million times.\", \"The Garage, a nightclub in Glasgow, shared the video to their TikTok account last week. \\\"Things found in the club at the end of the night,\\\" begins the on-screen text. Meanwhile, footage shows an employee's hand getting outfitted with a disposable glove.\", \"The clip then cuts to them finding various forgotten items, which ranged from the expected to the odd. That night, guests at the nightclub left a phone charger, \\\"endless passports,\\\" a men's puffer vest, a pack of mini playing cards, and a piece of jewelry.\", \"The finds didn't stop there. Next up, the employee spotted an iPhone with an extremely damaged and cracked screen, a full-sized bottle of what appears to be perfume, a tampon, and a single boot.\", \"Viewers were fascinated by the glimpse into the nightclub's inner workings.\", \"\\\"I will never understand how someone loses ONE shoe,\\\" said @suz.m.88 in a top-liked comment.\", \"\\\"Genius idea for a series,\\\" wrote @skeane20.\", \"\\\"This feels illegal to watch,\\\" commented @eunfrisbee.\", \"\\\"Plot twist,\\\" joked @jodywill80. \\\"It was the same person who lost them all.\\\"\", \"A handful of commenters jumped in with examples of items they'd lost on nights out\\u2014while others shared stories of weird workplace findings.\", \"\\\"I once found an entire Jenga game,\\\" said @someonetookmmy_username.\", \"\\\"The endless amount of lipsticks we have to sweep up is tragic,\\\" reported @itzjxlieee.\", \"\\\"My mate once had a show fall off at a gig,\\\" offered @crazydoodlelife. \\\"We waited till the end of the night to find it but it disappeared. Guess someone took home a random shoe!\\\"\", \"\\\"I've lost a shoe, a bra, knickers, earrings, hair extensions, a few jackets and a kebab on a night out,\\\" added @s.j_j.s.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939055/silent-disco.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A woman enjoying a silent all-night disco at the 2005 Glastonbury Music Festival.
