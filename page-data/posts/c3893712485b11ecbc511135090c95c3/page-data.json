Victims suffered scorching fever and body aches, and then spots and blisters that would leave survivors with pitted scars. \", \" The United States was able to end routine childhood vaccination against the disease by the early 1970s and said the last natural outbreak in the country occurred in 1949. In 1980, the World Health Assembly declared smallpox eradicated.\", \" There are two sites designated by the World Health Organization where stocks of variola virus are stored and used for research: the CDC facility in Atlanta and a center in Russia. \", \" Smallpox research in the United States focuses on the development of vaccines, drugs and diagnostic tests to protect people against smallpox in the event that it is used as an agent of bioterrorism, according to the CDC.\", \" In July 2014, officials said a government scientist cleaning out an old storage room at a Bethesda, Maryland, research center found six decades-old glass vials containing freeze-dried smallpox samples packed away and forgotten in a cardboard box. Officials called it the first discovery of unaccounted-for smallpox in the country.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"c3893712485b11ecbc511135090c95c3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c3893712485b11ecbc511135090c95c3"}},
