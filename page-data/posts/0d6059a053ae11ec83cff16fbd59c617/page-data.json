local police officer threatened to \\\"flog\\\" and \\\"hurt\\\" him.\", \"Video footage has emerged of the policeman in the remote town of Cunnamulla making threats against the 28-year-old man to his sister, Jacinta Munn, sparking informal internal inquiries within the Queensland Police Service (QPS).\", \"The man's family and an Indigenous rights expert are calling for immediate action to make him feel safe enough to return home.\", \"The footage,\\u00a0captured about two weeks ago, shows the Cunnamulla\\u00a0officer in the driver's seat of the marked police car, asking Ms\\u00a0Munn if she had seen her older brother.\", \"His family said police were looking for him over \\\"about $40\\u00a0worth of stolen Keno tickets\\\", but police would not comment on the circumstances.\", \"<img

\"\\\"If you do see him, tell him to come see me before I find him, or else I'll flog him.\\\"\", \"Ms Munn replies:\\u00a0\\\"Well, he'll get charged \\u2014\\u00a0I don't think you can flog him.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/76dec8b8dfd5495e9b87dd09d7e6a9fb\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The 28-year-old's father says

says the threats have scared the entire\\u00a0family.\", \"\\\"When you have a police officer, that is out there to protect and serve, say that they want to bash your son, I fear for not just his life, but all of my family,\\\" he said.\", \"Mr Munn said that from the way the officer was \\\"giggling\\\" in the video, he doubted he was going to merely \\\"fairy tap\\\" his son if he carried the threat out.\", \"\\\"I feared that he was going to give my son an ultimate hiding, the way he was smirking at that,\\\" Mr Munn said.\", \"\\\"If my son's done wrong, then take him, but don't threaten him along the way.\\\"\", \"Mr Munn said when his son left town after he saw the footage.\", \"\\\"Once he got that footage, he said, 'I'm outta here, I'm gone' \\u2014\\u00a0and sure enough, the next day I didn't see my son again,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"I haven't seen him yet.\", \"\\\"Mightn't have Christmas together this year because of that, because he won't come back to Cunnamulla, I can say that with confidence.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/2e17fb7143d3d84d3e95d790cf7aa686\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">

QPS officer.\", \"\\\"I think what is quite telling is that in a post-Black Lives Matter movement that a police officer could be so comfortable making those comments repeatedly,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"It speaks to the free licence the Queensland Police Service have.\\\"\", \"Police said no formal complaint had been made to its Ethical Standards Command.\", \"But Dr\\u00a0Watego said the QPS
