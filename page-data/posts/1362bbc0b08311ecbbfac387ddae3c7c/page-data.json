I hope that day comes soon, before October,\\\" he said.\", \"Some institutions were also disappointed by the allocation.\", \"Macleans College principal Steve Hargreaves said it applied for 29 students but only received 10.\", \"He said he was deeply disappointed because the school had worked hard to keep its international staff employed and maintained relations with overseas agents and families.\", \"\\\"We've run a really big international programme for decades and to be given 10, and I know that neighbouring schools with quite small programmes have been given six or seven places, I just find that really inequitable, unfair and I don't think it actually is in the best interests of New Zealand's international market,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"I don't think they've paid any attention to the size of the school programme or the time and effort and investment that schools have put in over the last few years and I also am pretty sure these schools don't actually have students ready to enrol because they haven't kept their programmes going, whereas we do.\\\"\", \"The allocation system ensured all 177 schools that applied were successful with the places spread across different regions and types of school.\", \"Education New Zealand said school applications were assessed by a panel that included representatives from Education New Zealand, the Ministry of Education, the Qualifications Authority and sector peak bodies, including the Schools International Education Business Association.\", \"Independent Tertiary Education New Zealand chairperson Craig Musson said the allocation for private tertiary institutions would ensure some staff did not lose their jobs but it was not really enough.\", \"\\\"It will be able to keep some ... staff employed and bring some money for the year for the international sector.
