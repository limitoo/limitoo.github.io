Bruno Mars was born in 1985. The sound of their new collaborative album, \\u201cAn Evening With Silk Sonic,\\u201d comes from a decade earlier, the 1970s, when the grit and funk of 1960s soul made way for a new embrace of sophisticated luxury.\", \"Singers promised sensual pleasures, sharing ardent come-ons and velvety harmonies in opulent tracks, backed by bountiful strings and horns. Working together as Silk Sonic, Mars and Paak revisit that bygone analog era in a hybrid of homage, parody, throwback and meticulous reverse engineering, tossing in some cheerfully knowing anachronisms. They flaunt skill, effort and scholarship, like teacher\\u2019s pets winning a science-fair prize; they also sound like they\\u2019re having a great time.\", \"Silk Sonic comes across as a continuation for Mars and a playfully affectionate tangent for Paak. Mars is a multi-instrumentalist with a strong retro streak. His voice and his verse-chorus-verse songwriting have harked back directly to Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, James Brown, the Police and others, as he concentrates on thoughts of seduction, romance and, occasionally, winning someone back.\", \"Paak\\u2019s catalog has delved into more complicated matters. On his albums, named after places where he has lived, he switches between singing and rapping, and his lyrics take on contemporary conditions; he\\u2019s also a musician steeped in live-band soul and R&B, and a hard-hitting drummer. His songs, like \\u201cLockdown\\u201d from 2020, confront the tensions of identity, desire, success, politics, self-expression and repression; Silk Sonic gives him a vacation from those weighty topics. On \\u201cAn Evening With Silk Sonic,\\u201d Paak\\u2019s specificity merges with Mars\\u2019s pop generalities, while both of them double down on craftsmanship and cleverness.\", \"For an album like this, Silk Sonic can use a co-sign from the elder generation, and the duo gets one from none other than Bootsy Collins, 70, the bassist of Parliament-Funkadelic \\u2014 the band Mars simulated on the title track of his 2016 album \\u201c24K Magic\\u201d \\u2014 and the possessor of the most liquid, self-satisfied speaking voice in the funk cosmogony. He arrives as \\u201cBootzilla himself\\u201d on the album\\u2019s \\u201cIntro to Silk Sonic\\u201d and shows up elsewhere as \\u201cUncle Bootsy,\\u201d certifying Silk Sonic\\u2019s 1970s bona fides by his sheer presence.\", \"Most of \\u201cAn Evening with Silk Sonic\\u201d revives the sound of 1970s groups like Earth, Wind & Fire, the Spinners, the Manhattans, the Chi-Lites and the Delfonics. Mars and Paak take turns delivering gritty, acrobatic lead vocals and layering on elaborate backups: creamy supportive harmonies, eager call-and-response, perky falsetto oohs.\", \"The production, by Mars and D\\u2019Mile (who has lately worked with H.E.R. and Lucky Daye), brings back all the instrumental flourishes of the analog era: wind-chime glissandos, wah-wah guitars, electric sitar. Only one song has a credit for \\u201cprogramming\\u201d; the rest of the album, presumably, was played by hand, in vintage style. \\u201cPut on a Smile\\u201d caps its confession of desperate heartache with the sounds of a thunderstorm, a nod to the \\u201cquiet storm\\u201d radio formats of the 1970s. And the song structures revel in thick chromatic chords and rising, uplifting key changes \\u2014 especially \\u201cBlast Off,\\u201d the album\\u2019s finale, which dreamily, repeatedly ascends as Mars asks, \\u201cCan we take it higher?\\u201d\", \"Between the ballads, Silk Sonic switches to funk. Driven by Paak\\u2019s assertive drumming, \\u201cFly as Me\\u201d and \\u201c777\\u201d invoke James Brown by way of Parliament. They span eras by including some rapping \\u2014 though Paak announces, in \\u201cFly as Me,\\u201d that he\\u2019s \\u201chollering from a 1977 Monte Carlo.\\u201d\", \"The distance between the 1970s and the 2010s also shows up in slightly rougher language and more openly materialistic lyrics. \\u201cSmokin Out the Window\\u201d is a bitter but still lovelorn song about a gold-digger ex \\u2014 the lyrics use a stronger word \\u2014 that has the singer \\u201csmokin\\u2019 out the window of my Benz.\\u201d And in \\u201cPut on a Smile,\\u201d Paak blends his tearful nostalgia with a designer-brand boast: \\u201cIf I could turn back the hands of my Rollie, you know I would,\\u201d he sings, referring to his Rolex.\", \"All in all, \\u201cAn Evening with Silk Sonic\\u201d is a Faberg\\u00e9 egg of an album: a lavish, impeccable bauble, a purely ornamental not-quite-period piece. Mars and Paak don\\u2019t pretend to be making any grand statement, but there\\u2019s delight in every detail.\"]","href_hash":"9bfd34b843cf11ec8a63fb57272933a7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9bfd34b843cf11ec8a63fb57272933a7"}},
