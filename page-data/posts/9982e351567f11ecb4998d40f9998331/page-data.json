I have to admit I was a tad surprised that some members of Congress had been trying to slow down critical votes on matters like keeping the government running in order to stage a rebellion against vaccination requirements.\", \"Bret: I doubt Mitch McConnell would allow a government shutdown \\u2014 he\\u2019s made that clear. Since the days of Speaker Newt Gingrich, it\\u2019s been a tried-and-true formula for helping Democrats recover from electoral defeat by making the Republican Party look about as attractive as, well, Newt Gingrich.\", \"Gail: You\\u2019re probably correct. Not sure whether to be relieved or disappointed for the loss of such a juicy issue.\", \"Bret: It\\u2019s the story of American politics: One party rescues the other from its mistakes by making even bigger mistakes.\", \"Gail: Moving on to question two: The loony right is trying to spread nutty rumors that vaccination might make you sterile. Is the sane right doing enough to push back?\", \"Bret: Nutty rumors? Are you referring to recent research by the Aaron Rodgers Institute of Reproductive Sciences, by any chance? I haven\\u2019t seen much conservative pushback there, though it\\u2019s worth noting that much vaccine nuttiness comes from people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who isn\\u2019t exactly a Republican, and lots of people in the woo-woo land of alternative medicine, which isn\\u2019t usually associated with rock-ribbed conservatives.\", \"Gail: Robert Kennedy Jr. isn\\u2019t exactly of a stature that requires a whole lot of concern. Some of his closest relatives published a piece that called him \\u201ctragically wrong.\\u201d\", \"Bret: Good to know.\", \"Gail: On guns we\\u2019ve got another heartbreaking mass shooting at a school, this time in Michigan. For a lot of people, it shows how important it is to have laws that require gun owners to store their weapons at home in secure places where underage family members or underage anyone can\\u2019t get their hands on them. But I\\u2019m not seeing Republican leaders call for that kind of very basic, obvious reform.\", \"Interpretations, please.\", \"Bret: Gail, this latest tragedy is a reminder, as the N.R.A. used to say, that people kill people \\u2014 and that it\\u2019s a lot easier to kill people when certain people with unmistakable signs of serious mental illness have access to a gun in an unlocked drawer, along with plenty of ammunition. In a sane world, this shooting would, at a minimum, lead to stronger safe-storage laws, though Republicans in Michigan let just such a law wither without a vote this year. How a party that claims to prize the immanent value of human life when it comes to a zygote can be so ambivalent about safeguarding the lives of innocent teenagers at school is simply beyond me.\", \"Gail: I knew you\\u2019d be standing tall on that one. I\\u2019m sure many, many schools are thinking about how to respond to all this. Clearly, they\\u2019ve been practicing what to do when a student starts spreading bullets around the classroom, but not so much on how to identify those potentially dangerous kids and deal with their potentially nut-case parents.\", \"Bret: But speaking of zygotes, any thoughts on the Supreme Court\\u2019s deliberations in the Mississippi abortion case?\", \"Gail: Well, it sure doesn\\u2019t look good for freedom of choice. At best, it sounds as if the majority will pare back \\u2014 maybe drastically \\u2014 the latest date at which all women would be guaranteed the right to end an unwanted pregnancy.\", \"Bret: The court will probably do itself a lot of institutional harm if it overturns Roe v. Wade. It\\u2019s been settled law for nearly 50 years and legal precedent deserves a lot of respect, especially from self-described conservatives, and especially when the precedent in question has done so much to shape the expectations and opportunities of our personal lives, and not just for women.\", \"On the other hand, if the court overturns Roe outright or pares it back so that Mississippi can ban nearly all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, it will probably do a lot to galvanize the abortion-rights movement in Congress and state legislatures. The pro-choice movement might eventually come to appreciate that it was a mistake to rely so heavily on the court system to secure abortion rights rather than through the normal democratic process.\", \"Gail: Don\\u2019t think basic civil rights should be up for a vote. It\\u2019s also some awful kind of irony that we\\u2019re watching the court prepare to chip away at a woman\\u2019s right to abort a fetus while our politicians refuse to do much of anything to protect a child\\u2019s right to go to school without being gunned down by a classmate.\", \"Meanwhile, the news is jammed with stories about new, encroaching Covid infections. Do me a favor, Bret, and turn our conversation to something cheery.\", \"Bret: I guess I\\u2019ll refrain from mentioning that the supply-chain situation has gotten so out of hand that there\\u2019s even a cream-cheese shortage at New York City bagel shops, which is like one of the 10 biblical plagues as reimagined by Mel Brooks.\", \"Gail: That does it. Returning to fetal position under the bed.\", \"Bret: To be totally frank, Gail, I\\u2019m struggling to see good news these days, except for a hope that the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus might end up proving more transmissible but less deadly than past variants. The result could be that it will, in essence, vaccinate the unvaccinated world by infecting them, and help bring the most deadly part of the pandemic to an end. But that might just be my wishful thinking getting ahead of the facts.\", \"Gail: Um, suspect you\\u2019re a tad overoptimistic.\", \"Bret: What about you? Anything cheering you up? Maybe Vladimir Putin promising that Russia will go carbon neutral by 2060?\", \"Gail: OK, I\\u2019ll give you a couple of quick cheery thoughts. I sorta hate the Giving Tuesday flood of emails, but they did remind me of how many of our fellow Americans are out every day volunteering for good causes \\u2014 everything from visiting the elderly sick to caring for abandoned animals.\", \"Bret: It\\u2019s one of the marvels of America. As you know, Gail, I grew up in Mexico City, where \\u2014 at least at the time \\u2014 there just wasn\\u2019t the same culture of philanthropy and volunteering as there is in the United States. People of means tended to measure their worth more by what they had than by what they gave. In fact, one of the many, many reasons I despised our former president was the way in which he stinted his own foundation.\", \"Gail: My second cheery thought is that America\\u2019s kids are so concerned about climate change. If we screw everything up, I have faith they\\u2019ll at least be ready to rush in with a rescue squad.\", \"Bret: Idealism is great unless it sours into fatalism. Or if it demands more than people are willing to give. I worry that the current young generation of Greta Thunbergs is merely going to spawn the next generation of cynics and reactionaries. It reminds me of the great Philip Larkin poem, \\u201cThis Be The Verse\\u201d:\", \"For the record, Larkin used an, um, slightly different version of the phrase \\u201cmess you up.\\u201d Anyway \\u2026.\", \"Gail: OK, that is a truly non-cheery poem. Try to repress it.\", \"You know, the holidays tend to be happy-making. A lot of folks go shopping for a tree, look forward to family visits. And in between get-togethers, at least one member of my household of two will point out that there are a ton of good games to watch. That\\u2019s the one thing I love about professional sports. Even if darkness descends, there\\u2019s a little ray of cheer here when the Patriots win.\", \"Bret: We\\u2019re just wrapping up Hanukkah. It\\u2019s the miraculous story of Super Bowl XLVI, when the underdog Giants beat the overconfident Patriots the way the Jews beat the Seleucids \\u2014 assisted by miracle.\", \"Gail: Hehehe. See, there\\u2019s always a little sunshine \\u2026\", \"Bret: Oh, that reminds me of one thing I am feeling optimistic about. We\\u2019re about to get a better mayor in New York, Eric Adams, who, unlike his dumb-as-he-is-tall predecessor, understands that the city won\\u2019t thrive until people feel safe, which in turn requires a police force that isn\\u2019t afraid to do its job and enforce the law.\", \"Gail: Yeah, the de Blasio departure alone deserves a holiday toast or two.\", \"Bret: My hope is that his election represents a definite turning away from the kind of progressive governance that\\u2019s done so much damage in cities like Chicago, Seattle and San Francisco, and that has also done a lot of damage to the Democratic Party\\u2019s reputation. If Adams succeeds, he\\u2019s going to be a force to reckon with in American politics. Are your hopes high?\", \"Gail: Sure! We\\u2019re about to enter a new year, and the rule is that optimism reigns at least until the second week in January.\", \"But seriously, I think we can celebrate Eric Adams without trashing progressive government. Not when there\\u2019s such a long list of conservative mayors, governors and police departments that have made things much worse for their people.\", \"Bret: You may just have a point.\", \"Gail: One last thought on the passing of Bob Dole. He was hardly a pal but I did follow him around when he was running \\u2014 haplessly \\u2014 for president. I didn\\u2019t agree with a whole lot of his agenda but I was sorta touched by his \\u2026 reasonableness. Never got the feeling he was just marching to his own tune and presuming everybody else was out of key.\", \"Bret: Bob Dole would say \\u201cBob Dole thanks you for your kindness, Gail.\\u201d He represented an era of political collegiality that I miss.\", \"Gail: So many Republicans now that we Democrats can\\u2019t imagine sitting down with for a drink or friendly chat.\", \"Present company most definitely excluded.\", \"Bret: Except I\\u2019m not a Republican anymore! But I\\u2019m always up for a drink.\"]","href_hash":"9982e351567f11ecb4998d40f9998331"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9982e351567f11ecb4998d40f9998331"}},
