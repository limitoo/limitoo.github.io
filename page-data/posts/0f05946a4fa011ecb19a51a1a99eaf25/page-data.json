Threw up.\\u201d\", \"She immediately knew her next move. \\u201cI thought, \\u2019I need to be with people in grief,\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cSo I came here two hours ago, and I\\u2019ve been here, singing and crying.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHere\\u201d was the Greenwich Village piano bar Marie\\u2019s Crisis Cafe, where a line formed in the late afternoon and never let up for hours as fans gathered to commune, aware that they would be surrounded by people who not only perfectly understood their feelings, but who also knew Sondheim deep cuts and could nail tongue-twisters like the \\u201cBobby baby, Bobby bubi, Bobby\\u201d line from \\u201cYou Could Drive a Person Crazy.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI had other plans tonight,\\u201d said Mark Valdez, 28. \\u201cMy family\\u2019s busy for the Thanksgiving holiday, but then we found out that Mr. Sondheim died.\\u201d Asked if he had ditched them to go to Marie\\u2019s, he laughed and then choked up a little: \\u201cOh no, I just brought them. It\\u2019s a family here and I want to be with family.\\u201d\", \"Jim Merillat, 63, was at the piano from 5:30 p.m. until 10 p.m., playing Sondheim tunes the entire time. \\u201cThis was a place to process the news and celebrate his life and his work,\\u201d he said, chatting with friends an hour after his shift had ended.\", \"\\u201cI found that phrases or even fragments of phrases in songs would catch me in a different way because now it was about him,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cI found myself a little choked up several times through the evening.\\u201d\", \"Across the street from Marie\\u2019s, the mood was decidedly more raucous at the Duplex, where an ad hoc reunion of \\u201cMostly Sondheim,\\u201d an open mic that ended a 12-year run in 2016, was underway. Inside, musical-theater insider jokes freely mixed with raunchy profanity and references to \\u201cThe Real Housewives of Salt Lake City.\\u201d The appreciative room fell into a hush at all the right moments, though, as when the music director Brian Nash teared up during the spoken opening of \\u201cSunday in the Park With George.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSee, I\\u2019m crying so hard, \\u201d he said. Then he and hosts Emily McNamara and Marty Thomas went straight into the upbeat \\u201cComedy Tonight.\\u201d\", \"Shortly after hearing the day\\u2019s news, Mr. Nash decided to bring back \\u201cMostly Sondheim.\\u201d Luckily, the upstairs cabaret at the Duplex, a few doors down from the Stonewall Inn, was available. \\u201cIt seemed important to hold a space for folks to feel whatever they needed to, to sing and cry and laugh and be with people who understood what a loss this was to those who love theater,\\u201d he said in an email sent near dawn.\", \"He had no problem rallying the troops.\", \"\\u201cI was so ready to go home and go to bed,\\u201d said Ms. McNamara, who had been at a big family gathering in New Jersey. \\u201cBut when Brian called me I was like, \\u2018I\\u2019ll chug some caffeine, put on some lashes, and let\\u2019s go!\\u2019 \\u201d\", \"There was trivia: \\u201cNow we\\u2019re going to find if there are actual nerds in the room: On what song did Sondheim write the lyrics under the pen name Esteban R\\u00edo Nido?\\u201d(Answer: \\u201cThe Boy From \\u2026\\u201d with music by Mary Rodgers.) And there were reminiscences about first encounters with Sondheim, and of high school performances.\", \"And even those stuck at home could join in when Telly Leung (who was once in a Broadway revival of \\u201cPacific Overtures\\u201d) encouraged the crowd to sing along to \\u201cNot a Day Goes By\\u201d \\u2014 the event was livestreamed on Facebook. (A commenter rejoiced: \\u201cI am trapped in Delaware with no access to a piano bar. Thank you Brian and all for bringing the tribe to me.\\u201d)\", \"Others mourned and celebrated Mr. Sondheim at the theater: he had shows running on Broadway and off when he died, and Friday night\\u2019s performances were exceptionally emotional.\", \"At the Classic Stage Company, which is presenting \\u201cAssassins,\\u201d Daniel Jay Park was there to celebrate his 40th birthday, but also to honor a master, whom he had worked with when he appeared in the 2004 revival of his musical \\u201cPacific Overtures.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhenever any one of us would mess up, his head would just lift up from the newspaper and we would all know,\\u201d he recalled before the Friday evening performance. \\u201cBefore any note was given, we would all know that something was wrong and we had to go back home and study, fix it.\\u201d\", \"Eric Anderson Jr., 38, a voice teacher and music director who lives just outside of Boston, was visiting New York for the holiday when he saw the news about Mr. Sondheim. Almost immediately, he told his husband he needed to go for a walk.\", \"He ended up gravitating toward Times Square \\u2014 and decided on a whim to go on something of a pilgrimage to Mr. Sondheim, visiting the Broadway theater named after him and then the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater on 45th Street, where the new revival of \\u201cCompany\\u201d was set to begin at 8 p.m.\", \"He saw people standing in line hoping for a last-minute ticket, and decided to get one too.\", \"\\u201cOur industry and our art form owes everything to him,\\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \\u201cI teach him to all of my students, of course.
