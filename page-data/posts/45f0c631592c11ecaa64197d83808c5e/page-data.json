Australians receive a COVID-19 vaccine, the conversation is increasingly turning to the issue of protecting children from the disease.\", \"In early December, Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) provisionally approved the Pfizer vaccine for children between five and 11 years of age.\", \"Now, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) has provided its recommendations around the program.\", \"The rollout will begin on January 10, with bookings opening in late December\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0a significant step forward for the nation's fight against the

vaccinations.\", \"Before that, the Canberra mother\\u00a0said she had not known her former partner to be opposed to vaccines.\", \"So when the vaccine rollout began, they were quickly at loggerheads over how to act on behalf of one of their children, who was older than 12 and therefore eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine.\", \"Lucy said she suggested a meeting where the pair could discuss the matter, but that never eventuated.\", \"\\\"So I had no way of dialoguing with him on it ...\\u00a0there was just nowhere\\u00a0to go,\\\" she said.\", \"Lucy sought legal advice and was told she was within her rights to take her child to be vaccinated.\", \"She was told that even if her ex-partner sought an injunction with the Federal Court, it was likely they would rule in favour of vaccination anyway.\", \"She said she also sought advice from ACT Health and was told the same thing.\", \"But Lucy said it was a distressing situation for all involved.\", \"In the end, her ex-partner\\u00a0did not intervene, but she said it was a difficult experience for herself and her child, who wanted to get vaccinated but was caught between parents with opposing views.\", \"\\\"It sent the relationship into a new low between us,\\\" she said.\", \"Lucy said her concerns had been raised once again since the TGA announced it had given provisional approval for children aged five to 11 to receive a vaccine from January 2022.\", \"Her younger child is in primary school, and would therefore soon be eligible.\", \"But Lucy remains fearful that her ex-partner will turn to the courts this time

matters, COVID-19 vaccines are likely to be a nuanced issue for the system\\u00a0to tackle once children become eligible.\", \"While vaccines have been proven to prevent severe illness and death, the court is not required to consider society as a whole when deciding on a case, only the wellbeing of the child.\", \"Di Simpson, an accredited specialist in family law based in Canberra, said it was likely there would be more cases involving a disagreement over COVID-19 vaccinations\\u00a0in court if vaccines were mandated for those under 12.\", \"But she said it was usually the case that parents in that situation would be strongly encouraged to seek a resolution before the court was forced to intervene.\", \"Currently, it is legal for one parent to take their children to be vaccinated without needing the approval of the other.\", \"But for those couples who have a standing disagreement that can't be resolved, the next step is usually mediation.\", \"\\\"It's not unusual to have a dispute

slightly more complicated.\", \"Ms Simpson said while judges usually ruled in favour of vaccination, ruling with the best interests of the child in mind given\\u00a0the relatively mild impact of the

severe.\", \"\\\"Parents are entitled to say, 'this child means everything to me, and I have an obligation to keep this child safe',\\\" she said.\", \"Ms Simpson said court\\u00a0decisions could\\u00a0depend on the potential side effects of the vaccines for children when they were inevitably approved by the regulator.\", \"\\\"There are some\\u00a0areas of uncertainty\\u00a0and there are credible arguments that a parent might run about just being fearful about risk,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"And so a judge in that instance would be doing what they often have to do, which is a risk
