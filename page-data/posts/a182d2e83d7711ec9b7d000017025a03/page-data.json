So there is fundamentally always going to be a conflict between what they say and what they actually have to do to make money.\", \"\\\"There's no way to ever get around their conflict unless they change their business model, and they're not going to do that.\\\"\", \"On Meta's metaverse, Yen noted there are \\\"tons of articles mocking it\\\" and that he thinks it is \\\"worthy of mockery in some aspects.\\\"\", \"\\\"But it's also insidious in many ways. What is Facebook actually doing? What is the purpose? Facebook's issue today is they don't control their destiny,\\\" Yen said.\", \"\\\"They depend on other platforms, other devices to reach their customers, whether it's iPhone, the Chrome browser, Google Search, whatever it may be.\", \"\\\"What they're doing with the metaverse is really they're building a new infrastructure where they control everything. They control the device, they have the VR headsets, you're now in their world, on their devices, on their platform.\\\"\", \"Yen continued: \\\"Given Facebook's track record, given what we've seen from the recent whistleblower, given what we've learned about the way that they've behaved, not just 10 years ago, when Mark Zuckerberg was still young as he calls it, but even right up to the current moment, I don't believe that's a company we should trust with power like that.\", \"\\\"There is plenty of evidence to show that they have not really changed or evolved as a business, despite what the rhetoric might lead you to believe. \\\"\", \"Facebook is under fire due to the allegations by whistleblower Frances Haugen, who has criticized the approach to hate speech on the platform, accusing the company of prioritizing its bottom line over reducing the harm it does to people.\", \"Clegg, who spoke to Web Summit via video link, rejected the notion that hate speech is profitable for Facebook or that they are not giving fighting it sufficient attention and resources.\", \"Facebook has long faced privacy concerns, with recent questions raised surrounding its facial recognition system.
