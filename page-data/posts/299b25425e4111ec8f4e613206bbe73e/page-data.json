separate M\\u0101ori trusts have been given funding to support infrastructure and building costs.\", \"The M\\u0101ori trusts involved include Mary Roberts Kotahi Roberts trust, T\\u0101whia Te Ao Papakainga trust and Pareaute Ep\\u0101para Ahu Whenua Trust.\", \"It's a part of a joint initiative between each M\\u0101ori trust, the ministry for housing and urban development and Te Puni

equivalent to two one-bedroom and one two-bedroom homes.\", \"T\\u016bmai said it was a way forward for wh\\u0101nau wanting to reconnect and live in on their own ancestral land.\", \"\\\"The papakainga will mean families whether they have their own homes or not will always know that they have a home to come back to and know that it will always be there for generations to come.\", \"\\\"It's definitely a big help... for our M\\u0101ori families to have their own home on their own land and get all our people back together to reconnect back to their land and their home.\\\"\",

\"Rawiri said Ng\\u0101ruaw\\u0101hia was \\\"a place of growing\\\" in the Waikato region and was well-positioned to hold several new developments which were already underway.\", \"\\\"All of these papakainga are being built on land that has been with the wh\\u0101nau for several generations and we heard about how the wh\\u0101nau had acquired the land and their connection to Te Puea Herangi in particular when she was establishing T\\u016brangawaewae marae.\", \"\\\"Papakainga remain a key part of our housing program at Te Puni K\\u014dkiri and there are examples of building of papakainga already happening across the country.\", \"\\\"These are just three great examples of wh\\u0101nau coming together to be able to utilize their ancestral lands so that they can live on it\\\" she said.\", \"T\\u0101whia Te Ao Papak\\u0101inga Trust also received $1,349,000 towards the second stage of their papakainga project that will build three rental homes and the infrastructure for two existing whare.\", \"Trust chairperson Matutaera Herangi said the papakainga were a way to respond to the hardships their wh\\u0101nau had faced trying to get into houses.\", \"\\\"Housing is difficult to actually get into these days and our wh\\u0101nau struggle to purchase homes and even to rent these days.\", \"\\\"What we wanted to do was to provide whare for our own wh\\u0101nau\\\"

the first stage, they were supporting us to consult with our wh\\u0101nau.\", \"\\\"We had... weekend w\\u0101nanga, preparing ourselves to actually create plans of how our papakainga would look and how we would utilize our space and the types of things we would do\\\" he said.\", \"Rawiri said the venture will also mean wh\\u0101nau can have the opportunity to explore other areas whether it be personal, business, or cultural.\", \"\\\"It takes a lot of planning, dedication and hard work to build a papak\\u0101inga, but this community will reap benefits that go further than having four walls and a roof.\", \"\\\"We know that good quality housing creates a developmental springboard to a healthier wh\\u0101nau who are better positioned to explore other development opportunities whether they be personal, business, or cultural.\", \"\\\"A big mihi to all three wh\\u0101nau for the steps they are taking to provide their wh\\u0101nau and community with safe, affordable housing,\\\" Rawiri
