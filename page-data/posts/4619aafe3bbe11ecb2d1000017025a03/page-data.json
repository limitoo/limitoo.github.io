Some readers may want to escape the present, but there are those of us who want to see a writer find the language for what is unfolding, to give us the slanted, intimate clarity that can\\u2019t be achieved in other ways. After months of epidemiology Twitter, after the reportage about the dying and the dead, I turned to writers: Zadie Smith\\u2019s lyrical writing about the moral implications of the privileged stay-at-home class, Patricia Lockwood\\u2019s hilarious piece about getting Covid, and Lorrie Moore\\u2019s unstinting story \\u201cFace Time,\\u201d in which the description of isolation from a father as he died made me feel less isolated in my own grief. Gary Shteyngart brings his version of the above to his reflective, earthy, humane new novel, \\u201cOur Country Friends,\\u201d which is rife with the problem of privilege, the profoundly leveling experience of the virus, and an ever-present sense of absurdity and humor.\", \"\\u201cOur Country Friends\\u201d takes place in 2020 at the Hudson Valley estate of Sasha Senderovsky, a once very successful writer of \\u201cstupid comic novels\\u201d that sound a lot like an unflattering version of Shteyngart\\u2019s own oeuvre. Naturally Shteyngart makes him the butt of most of the farcical humor here, as Sasha spends the novel flapping around in a ridiculous dressing gown and drinking ungodly amounts of alcohol.\", \"He and his wife, Masha, a psychiatrist, both emigrated from Russia as children. It was Sasha\\u2019s dream to have a house surrounded by little cottages, a colony like the one he remembers from his childhood summers, and he has spent far beyond his means to maintain his \\u201cdacha.\\u201d They have a daughter adopted from China, Nat, who is 8 and has anxiety, an obsession with the K-pop group BTS and a precocity that sometimes unnerves adults. Sasha has invited his closest pals to ride out the lockdown in his cottages: Karen, a Korean American who designed an app (Tr\\u00f6\\u00f6 Emotions) that makes people fall in love and has made her very rich; Vinod, an Indian immigrant and an unpublished, brilliant writer who has lost part of a lung to cancer and lost his adjunct professor gig; Ed, an heir to a wealthy Korean family and a snobby sophisticate; and Dee, a white former student of Sasha\\u2019s who\\u2019s very attractive and has written a provocative book of essays about her poor background. Also invited (partly to lure the others and partly to seal a TV deal Sasha is working on) is a famous person, \\u201cthe Actor.\\u201d He\\u2019s ridiculously good-looking (after he arrives each of the women masturbates about him in her own super-specific way); he talks about his time in \\u201cNew Haven\\u201d rather than saying Yale; and he compares himself to Odysseus before anyone has even had coffee. In short, he\\u2019s a perfect monster, half Tom Berenger in \\u201cThe Big Chill\\u201d and half Terence Stamp in \\u201cTeorema.\\u201d\", \"There are many mentions of Russian literature, from Lermontov to Tolstoy to Chekhov, and toward the end, the characters actually perform \\u201cUncle Vanya.\\u201d In some respects, \\u201cOur Country Friends\\u201d does feel like a Russian novel. The narration is not the close third person of Shteyngart\\u2019s previous book, \\u201cLake Success,\\u201d or the hyper-modern, hilarious alternating unmediated voices of his best-selling 2010 novel, \\u201cSuper Sad True Love Story.\\u201d Here Shteyngart uses a 19th-century-style omniscience, moving from mind to mind within a scene (and, like Tolstoy, even occasionally inhabiting the minds of animals) while drawing back and commenting to the reader from a perspective that none of the characters are privy to. This choice seems suited to the subject: We were all thrust into a vast calamity that we didn\\u2019t understand and over which we had no control. The world feels relentlessly godless. Our all-knowing narrator steps in to give us the big picture in inimitable Shteyngartian style, such as this unexpected but apt simile extended to an absurd punchline: \\u201cEvery diner \\u2026 had learned something new about another, and the secrets were as piquant as the habanero-laced tonnato they were now shoveling down without regard for the country plumbing.\\u201d Or to give us asides: \\u201cHe had missed his own pun.\\u201d This narration also allows the novel to adopt a tone of wry self-reflexivity, as in this slap at the very idea of writing a pandemic novel: \\u201cStranded social novelists up and down the river \\u2026 beseeching their higher power to help me make something out of all this stillness.\\u201d\", \"In forced proximity, affairs are had, old and new betrayals come to light. For much of this, Shteyngart backs away from his customary frenetic, high-satire register. Often time moves slowly (like a Russian novel or like \\u201cTerrace House,\\u201d the Japanese reality show the characters binge-watch). There are wonderfully vivid descriptions of food and weather and sex. Some aspects are somber. There\\u2019s no internet in the cottages, so the characters are isolated from what is happening down in the city. One of them thinks about \\u201ca series of refrigerated trucks parked behind his local hospital in Queens, collecting the forklifted bodies of the dead.\\u201d He writes emails to those left behind but then he goes back to looking at butterflies, reading, eating glorious meals. He feels guilt. \\u201cBut he stayed. They all did.\\u201d Shteyngart\\u2019s engagement with the complexities of privilege, a subject made so stark in 2020, most compelled me.\", \"Yes, they are protected because of their access to this property and to money \\u2014 even the ones who aren\\u2019t rich have cultural capital and connections. Yet many of them have suffered racism and xenophobia and damaged parents humbled by the hard terms of their new country.\", \"In the second half of the novel, it grows harder to ignore the world outside the bubble. They see the video of George Floyd\\u2019s murder, hear about the protests and note Blue Lives Matter signs popping up among the locals. Sasha admits to himself that he is complicit, that all these years he \\u201csaw, but he also did not see, or pretended not to see. (Or refused to see.) \\u2026 He distanced his gaze from the country he inhabited.\\u201d As an immigrant, he began as an outsider but then did what he could to make his way. \\u201cBy which point, you were just a scab sent in to reinforce the established order. \\u2026 All of us are useful and expendable in turn.\\u201d A mysterious black pickup truck seems to menace them for being outsiders or nonwhite people. The locals \\u2014 the peasants, to follow this Russian theme \\u2014 are hired by Sasha and paid only sometimes. Some are racist Trump supporters, some have cryptic white supremacist tattoos and bumper stickers. Others are perhaps benign. But this isn\\u2019t their story, after all.\", \"Despite the estate\\u2019s isolation, the virus does indeed make its way there. There are no real bubbles, not forever. First social media virality hits, as one character gets a well-deserved callout that cascades into a relentless pile-on. Then the coronavirus slips in, invisible, searching out the vulnerable, culminating in a harrowing depiction of Covid delirium and tribulation.\", \"In this dense, ambitious novel, some elements fall flat. The speculative tech of the Tr\\u00f6\\u00f6 Emotions app seems to belong in a different book (although those umlauts are funny), and the more the characters tried to explain it, the less sense it made to me. And I didn\\u2019t need Sasha\\u2019s ongoing betrayal of one of his closest friends. I appreciate that Shteyngart wants to be unflinching about Sasha\\u2019s failings, but it struck me as too cruel for his character.\", \"The novel\\u2019s strengths abound. It upends clich\\u00e9s, pieties and commonplaces while also noticing salient details of the lockdown. One character can\\u2019t help obsessing over intubation, feeling for the tube in his throat and imagining the sound ventilators make. And how many writers could pull off a sex scene that climaxes with a request to put on a surgical mask for the transgressive kink of it, and also describe with exquisite precision how strange the beauty of the natural world felt during that hellscape spring and summer?\", \"Two romantic connections, and another unconventional maternal one, make an argument for love being a consolation: of the lockdown, yes, but of humanity, always. It works because the author is aware of his characters\\u2019 hypocrisies and vanities. Shteyngart doesn\\u2019t let them off the hook, but he does allow them (and us) some respite.\"]","href_hash":"4619aafe3bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4619aafe3bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}},
