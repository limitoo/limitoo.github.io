I definitely had a little water retention. It was just the right amount of dad-bod.\\u201d\", \"By all accounts, Forte, 51, is a gentle, soft-spoken person \\u2014 considerate of his family, attentive to his 9-month-old daughter, Zoe, and excited by something as simple as an unusual pair of socks.\", \"Yet something transformative happens to him when he assumes the role of MacGruber, an unapologetically crude action hero who has survived multiple explosions as well as a bomb of a movie, 2010\\u2019s \\u201cMacGruber,\\u201d that attempted to expand the comedy shorts to feature length.\", \"Now \\u2014 to Forte\\u2019s amazement as much as anyone else\\u2019s \\u2014 MacGruber is back in a streaming series more than a decade in the making, that picks up where the movie left off.\", \"The \\u201cMacGruber\\u201d series, which will be released on Dec. 16, once again allows Forte to show off fictitious combat skills, eviscerate evildoers and utter some of the most vulgar dialogue he and his co-writers can devise.\", \"The show\\u2019s arrival also provides a moment for the button-down Forte and some of his most trusted collaborators to contemplate why he connects so fully to this outlandish character.\", \"It is a question that Forte said he has occasionally pondered over a career spent making what he called \\u201csmarter things cloaked in dumb stuff,\\u201d and one that he finds himself no closer to answering.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not a complete sicko,\\u201d he said in a video interview last week. \\u201cBut I\\u2019m pretty desensitized to everything. I\\u2019ve lived inside me for a long time, so I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019m especially perverse. Maybe I\\u2019m just used to me.\\u201d\", \"MacGruber began at \\u201cS.N.L.\\u201d in the early 2000s, where the writer Jorma Taccone (who originally pitched him as a role for the guest host Lance Armstrong) imagined the character as the coarse, bumbling stepbrother of MacGyver, the inventive TV hero first portrayed by Richard Dean Anderson.\", \"Forte instead played the character, in recurring sketches that aired between 2007 and 2010, and that he wrote with Taccone and John Solomon. In almost every segment the character was shown attempting \\u2014 and failing \\u2014 to defuse an incendiary device before a timer runs out.\", \"\\u201cIt always ended with me exploding but the journey to get to the explosion was different enough,\\u201d Forte said. Still, he was surprised the character recurred on \\u201cS.N.L.\\u201d as often as he did: \\u201cEvery step of the way, it seemed like, oh, that\\u2019s the end of the road for it,\\u201d he said.\", \"Instead, MacGruber was featured in a Pepsi commercial that was shown during the Super Bowl in 2009. The following year, Forte starred in a \\u201cMacGruber\\u201d movie that he wrote with Taccone and Solomon, and which Taccone directed.\", \"The film moved beyond the character\\u2019s imitative \\u201cMacGyver\\u201d origins and made him more of a one-man army in the style of 1980s action protagonists like Rambo and John McClane. It also took full advantage of its R rating, utilizing a colorful vocabulary that would never fly on \\u201cS.N.L.\\u201d and, in one enduring scene, having MacGruber distract his enemies by strutting around nude with a celery stalk protruding from between his buttocks.\", \"Ryan Phillippe, who co-starred in the movie as Lt. Dixon Piper, a friend and ally to MacGruber, recalled the experience of attending its premiere at the SXSW festival in March 2010.\", \"\\u201cThe response was uproarious,\\u201d Phillippe said. \\u201cPeople were hooting and clapping. I thought we had a hit on our hands. Maybe not \\u2018The Hangover,\\u2019 but a modest hit.\\u201d\", \"But when it opened that May, \\u201cMacGruber\\u201d was a flop, receiving savage reviews and grossing barely more than $9 million worldwide. Forte said he and his collaborators were taken aback at first but remained \\u201coddly proud of our disgusting little movie.\\u201d He found it meaningful that the movie\\u2019s creators stuck to their own strange sensibilities of what they found funny.\", \"\\u201cOh, I have bomb experience \\u2014 that\\u2019s no \\u2018MacGruber\\u2019 pun,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been a part of things where you change things to try to make them more accessible to people and they still bomb, and that\\u2019s the hardest. This was an easier shellacking to handle.\\u201d\", \"He added, \\u201cWe certainly had a couple weeks where we questioned every decision we made. After two weeks we realized, you know what? We wouldn\\u2019t have changed a thing.\\u201d\", \"Lorne Michaels, the creator and longtime executive producer of \\u201cS.N.L.\\u201d, said that \\u201cMacGruber\\u201d and the kind of comedy it stands for were important to defend, even when the wider public has not come along for the ride.\", \"\\u201cI think it\\u2019s truly funny but it\\u2019s not something any legitimate critic is going to praise,\\u201d said Michaels, who is also a producer of the \\u201cMacGruber\\u201d film and TV series.\", \"\\u201cIt pushes so far beyond the acceptable,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt embraces dumb, in a way that most people are embarrassed to admit they like. People like better-behaved comedy, but comedy is disruptive and can be annoying. It\\u2019s freeing. Maybe it\\u2019s adolescent boy stuff. It can\\u2019t be justified, so it needs somebody to speak up for it.\\u201d\", \"Over time, the reputation of the movie had nowhere to go but up. As Phillippe recalled, \\u201cI would run into comedians and filmmakers who said, \\u2018This is my favorite thing to watch when I\\u2019m depressed.\\u2019 I heard that there were college drinking games based on \\u2018MacGruber\\u2019 \\u2014 you take a shot every time somebody says \\u2018Grubes.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Forte went on to star in films like the comedy-drama \\u201cNebraska\\u201d and on the Fox series \\u201cThe Last Man on Earth,\\u201d where Solomon was a writer and producer. Taccone directed films like \\u201cPopstar: Never Stop Never Stopping\\u201d (with Akiva Schaffer) and TV shows like \\u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine.\\u201d\", \"Yet they never gave up on the idea of a \\u201cMacGruber\\u201d sequel. \\u201cWe had a ton of ideas on a Google doc that we had been adding to for 11 years,\\u201d Taccone said. \\u201cA lot of entries like \\u2018Whoever smelt it, dealt it,\\u2019 question mark, four asterisks.\\u201d\", \"Though the writers were told their proposed follow-up wasn\\u2019t financially viable as a movie, a new window of opportunity opened when NBC introduced its Peacock streaming service, where \\u201cMacGruber\\u201d was picked up as an eight-episode series.\", \"Given this new lease on life, Taccone said the goal of the \\u201cMacGruber\\u201d creators was not to alter the character or fix perceived flaws in the film, but to provide \\u201cthe enhanced version\\u201d of the movie \\u2014 still violent and obscene, but otherwise played like a straight-ahead thriller, never winking at the audience or acknowledging its own outrageousness.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s part of the joke to us,\\u201d Taccone said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re creating an action-movie world to then destroy it, and the more real it is, the funnier it is that it has this incorrect lead.\\u201d\", \"The \\u201cMacGruber\\u201d series finds its hero once again drawn into dangerous situations with global implications and facing off against a villain from his past. Its cast includes several veterans of other authentic, non-satirical adventure films, including Laurence Fishburne, Billy Zane and Sam Elliott, as well as returning franchise regulars like Phillippe and Kristen Wiig.\", \"Wiig, who has played MacGruber\\u2019s love interest, Vicki St. Elmo, since the original \\u201cS.N.L.\\u201d sketches, said that whenever she has worked with the show\\u2019s creative team she has felt the freedom to be as ridiculous as the material requires.\", \"Often on comedy projects, Wiig said, \\u201cYou tend to doubt yourself or wonder, is this going to be funny? I don\\u2019t have that with those guys. I just fully trust them. What did you write? I\\u2019ll say it.\\u201d\", \"And no one embodies that spirit of over-the-top absurdity better than Forte himself. \\u201cThere\\u2019s just no self-awareness, in the best of ways,\\u201d Wiig said. \\u201cHe\\u2019s just like, I\\u2019m going for it. And you\\u2019re like, what is on the other side of that brain of yours?\\u201d\", \"Solomon, who has known Forte since they were students together at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that playing MacGruber offered his friend a place for creative expressions that don\\u2019t otherwise fit within his happily quotidian life.\", \"\\u201cIt is the perfect outlet for him to get everything out,\\u201d Solomon said. \\u201cWill really cares about listening to people and making them feel comfortable and heard. There\\u2019s a lot of intense stuff going on in his brain and MacGruber is opening a valve. He loves to commit and he feels comfortable with the positions that MacGruber has to take.\\u201d\", \"Forte himself said he identified with the character only up to a point: \\u201cI try to be a nice and respectful person. I don\\u2019t rip anybody\\u2019s throats out in my private life.\\u201d\", \"He added, \\u201cWe do a lot of dirty things in this series but, believe it or not, we self-police ourselves. There are times where we go, \\u2018No, that\\u2019s too gross, that\\u2019s definitely over the line.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Forte said he awaited the release of the \\u201cMacGruber\\u201d series with a certain glee to see how some of its raunchiest jokes will be received. But in perhaps the surest sign that he does not share the callousness of the character, he also expressed concern for how the show might affect his mother\\u2019s social standing.\", \"\\u201cMy mom had a couple friends who had gone to see the movie in 2010, and they really dropped her because of the movie, which is so crazy,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd there were a couple of friends on the fence, and we got those friends back with \\u2018Nebraska.\\u2019 This is going to sever it again. The \\u2018MacGruber\\u2019 series is going to get her into trouble.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"485cb6ba585811ecaf39a1376c3a2b0e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"485cb6ba585811ecaf39a1376c3a2b0e"}},
