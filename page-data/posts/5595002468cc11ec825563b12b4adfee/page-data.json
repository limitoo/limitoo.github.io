While no one has reported ash falling on houses yet, Kula advised that the public should take measures to protect their rainwater catchment and storage systems, should ash make landfall.\", \"Kula said that people need to make sure they continue to sanitise and maintain their rainwater tanks, to stop the growth of a particular algae bloom that results from ash contamination.\", \"Flight from NZ cancelled\", \"Meanwhile, the flight from New Zealand that was scheduled to arrive on Tuesday was cancelled due the volcanic activity at Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha'apai.\", \"Matangi Tonga online reports the flight was meant to bring in the funeral cortege of the late Lord Ma'afu.\", \"Tonga's Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Ma'afu, died on 12 December at the Auckland City Hospital, New Zealand.\", \"Air New Zealand's flight to Tonga on 21 December was also cancelled due to the same volcanic activity.\", \"RNZ\"]","href_hash":"5595002468cc11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5595002468cc11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
