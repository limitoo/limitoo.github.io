statewide register, and apply for permission to rent them out for more than 60 nights a year, under a draft government planning policy.\\u00a0\", \"Short-stay accommodation booking sites Airbnb and Stayz have criticised the WA\\u00a0government's move to regulate the sector, describing the draft proposals as among the strictest in the nation.\", \"They also warn\\u00a0that putting a cap on the number of nights\\u00a0homes can be let for will\\u00a0have flow-on effects for holiday towns that rely on the business tourists bring in.\", \"The\\u00a0WA\\u00a0government has stressed the draft

down on what it said was an often unregulated sector.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Incredibly damaging'</div>\", \"The draft policy comes more than two years after a parliamentary inquiry
