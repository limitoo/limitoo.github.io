A Christmas tree is a symbol. It's a symbol of a specific culture, it's a symbol of the much loved tradition that is hundreds of years old,\\\" Carlson said.\", \"\\\"But above all, it's a symbol of a religion, in this case the world's largest religion. Torching Christmas trees is an attack on Christianity.\", \"\\\"By current standards, destroying someone's religious symbol would be called a hate crime. That's a category much beloved and meticulously chronicled by the Biden Justice Department.\", \"\\\"The DOJ can tell you precisely how many Korans were burned last year in the United States, but they don't keep track of Christmas trees. Why is that? Well, because they couldn[n't] care less.\\\"\", \"Carlson also criticized the media for downplaying similar incidents of Christmas trees being burned down. He noted how this week CBS ran the headline: \\\"Search On For Grinch Who Burned Down Christmas Tree In Washington Park,\\\" after the tree at 55th and King Drive in Chicago was vandalized for the third year in a row.\", \"\\\"Oh, it's a Grinch. Not an arsonist. Not a dangerous anti-Christian psychopath,\\\" Carlson said. \\\"No, it's a Grinch and amusing dwarfishly cute cartoon character absolutely nobody can take seriously.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Wider Problem</div>\", \"The Fox News host went on to suggest that the burning of the All American Christmas Tree is part of a wider problem of wanted suspects being \\\"set free by left wing ideologues to terrorize everyone else.\\\"\", \"NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea confirmed that Tamanaha was issued with appearance tickets earlier this year, but didn't come back to court. He has also previously been arrested for drug possession and public intoxication.\", \"\\\"This has become a new wonderful tradition on FOX Square over the last three years. We will not let this deliberate and brazen act of cowardice deter us.\\\"\", \"Fox News said a new All American Christmas Tree will be lit during a broadcast of The Five on Thursday.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948212/tucker-carlson-christmas.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Tucker Carlson has suggested that the arson attack on the Christmas tree displayed outside Fox News\\u2019 offices was an \\\"attack on Christianity.\\\" </div>\"]","href_hash":"839359d658d111ec9696c9adec706c5f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"839359d658d111ec9696c9adec706c5f"}},
