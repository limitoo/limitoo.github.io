He was suspended with pay by Victoria Police but has since returned to work in the same role at the same station.\\u00a0\", \"Still, he was an outlier: the majority of those charged \\u2014 five of the eight employees, or nearly 63 per cent \\u2014 had their charges withdrawn or struck out by the court, highlighting remarkable disparities between alleged perpetrators in police ranks and offenders in the general community. For context, 12 per cent of defendants finalised in Victoria's criminal courts in the year to June 2020 had their matter withdrawn by the prosecution.\", \"The documents also show one of the officers charged was sacked: Victoria Police said he was dismissed at a disciplinary hearing \\\"due to family violence related assault\\\", ostensibly before any criminal charges could be finalised in court. But the exact circumstances of his dismissal are unclear, and police would not provide further information, such as whether he was being investigated for other misconduct.\", \"For police accountability experts, the figures are a frustrating reminder that Australia's biggest police force \\u2014 and when it comes to addressing the issue of officers who perpetrate domestic violence, the most proactive \\u2014\\u00a0will likely be grappling with an accountability \\\"crisis\\\" for as long as police are allowed to investigate themselves without robust external oversight.\", \"It comes at an awkward time, following the launch last month of Victoria Police's standalone policy for dealing with family violence involving employees and a new unit tasked with investigating \\\"high risk matters\\\", which senior police have said will stop abusive officers from being given \\\"special treatment\\\".\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ea6c38fb211d7faf0a6b16d91e063432\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> To see so few officers convicted in court is of serious concern, says Lauren Caulfield.(Supplied: Charandev Singh)</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Dozens of police employees subject to intervention orders</div>\", \"Lauren Caulfield, coordinator of the Policing Family Violence Project, said the \\\"strikingly low rate\\\" of officers charged with family violence last year and \\\"even lower rate of convictions'' were \\\"at odds\\\" with public statements by police that they take the issue seriously.\\u00a0\", \"She said the new figures were likely a fraction of the actual number of family violence perpetrators in the force given what is known about the problem in other countries, how difficult it can be for victims to report \\u2014\\u00a0and for police to take action against their own.\\u00a0\", \"For comparison, in the year ending June 2020, there were 29 domestic and family violence offenders per 10,000 persons in Victoria. Yet of almost 18,000 officers employed by Victoria Police, last year just eight were charged (or about four per 10,000).\", \"\\\"Despite more women speaking publicly about violence they've experienced by partners or ex-partners who are police, this is the lowest number of officers charged with family violence in a calendar year for at least six years,\\\" Ms Caulfield said.\", \"\\\"Given the severity and scale of the violence involved, to see so few officers convicted in court is of serious concern. Such low charge and conviction rates speak volumes about the ongoing culture of impunity within Victoria Police and the level of risk victim-survivors, mainly women and children, are facing.\\\"\", \"Ms Caulfield said she was also troubled by the number of Victoria Police employees currently subject to a family violence intervention order. Documents obtained by the ABC show 65 employees were named as respondents to interim or final orders as at November 19, while 156 employees were recorded as victims.\", \"\\\"Given Victoria Police's own policy ... states that perpetrating family violence does not align with Victoria Police's organisational values, this begs the question as to why there are 65 perpetrators still employed there, and what duties they're undertaking in the community,\\\" she said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Police lack 'meaningful' independent oversight</div>\", \"Lawyer and police accountability specialist Jeremy King said the new data suggested not a lot had changed with how police handle family violence matters involving employees, which was unsurprising given the force only recently launched its new policy and investigative unit.\", \"\\\"It shows that Victoria Police doesn't have a particularly good track record of holding accountable members who've perpetrated family violence, and that we still have a long way to go in this area,\\\" said Mr King, who leads the police misconduct team at Robinson Gill.\\u00a0\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/9fbdd4d68d2fa646f34498f60e026dbf\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> A corruption commission is not best placed to be an external police oversight body, says lawyer Jeremy King.(ABC News)</div>\", \"But while the new policy was a \\\"good start\\\", he said, the way it determines which \\\"high risk\\\" cases will be investigated by the new unit was \\\"pretty woolly\\\". \\\"It really is still police investigating themselves, providing oversight of themselves, and having complete control over the process. And I think that that is fundamentally a problem and will continue to be a problem going forward.\\\"\", \"It is a \\\"problem\\\" particularly because Victoria has what Mr King describes as a \\\"flawed\\\" external police oversight system in the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission. IBAC investigates only about 2 per cent of the complaints about police it receives, referring the rest back to police for self-investigation \\u2014\\u00a0which it has attributed to a lack of powers and resources. \\\"To me, that is not meaningful or substantive independent oversight,\\\" he said.\", \"Another issue is that it's unclear what IBAC defines as \\\"serious police misconduct\\\"\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0and therefore which cases it will investigate. Mr King said he would be surprised if it was taking on any cases of family violence involving police officers because they often don't have \\\"clear cut\\\" evidence like CCTV footage and can be difficult to deal with.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">IBAC 'needs to be overhauled'</div>\", \"Reforming and improving community confidence in IBAC is firmly on the agenda of the Victorian Government, which this year launched a systemic review of police oversight\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0a key recommendation of the Lawyer X royal commission. The review was opened for public consultation earlier this month, with the government expected to introduce legislative reforms in 2022.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\", \"Mr King said in a \\\"perfect world\\\" the review would have happened years ago, but that he was \\\"hopeful\\\" it would lead to \\\"meaningful\\\" change. \\\"In my view ... a corruption commission is not best placed to be an external police oversight body and deal with human beings making complaints about police. So really, the whole thing needs to be overhauled,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"IBAC by its very nature is a corruption commission \\u2014\\u00a0it's not a police oversight body, it's not a police ombudsman \\u2014 it's set up to deal with all government corruption. And that is a very wide remit in terms of what it has to do and what it has to deal with.\\\"\", \"Victoria Police's Acting Assistant Commissioner of Professional Standards, Andrea McAlpine, did not respond to specific questions about why relatively few officers were charged with family violence last year, why so many matters did not proceed to court, and why it was considered appropriate for the senior constable who was convicted of his charges to remain employed as a frontline officer.\", \"In a statement she said Victoria Police was \\\"committed\\\" to holding employees who commit family violence to account and hoped to see family violence reporting increase \\\"as victims have more confidence in police's investigation of and response to these crimes\\\".\", \"\\\"Family violence continues to be an underreported crime, but we want victims to come forward,\\\" Ms McAlpine said. \\\"We will continue to look at ways we can improve our data collection in this area to allow us to better monitor trends, including why matters are not reaching court.\", \"\\\"We will also look at ways we can make this data more accessible to the community as part of our commitment to be transparent.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"f3c5895c5ea511eca5d60d7cdd4d2d9d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f3c5895c5ea511eca5d60d7cdd4d2d9d"}},
