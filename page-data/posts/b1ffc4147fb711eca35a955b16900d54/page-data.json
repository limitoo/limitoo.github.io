to organise and fundraise themselves,\\\" the letter read. \\\"Current measures are proving insufficient.\\\"\", \"Among the examples of harmful and dangerous misinformation put forward by fact checkers was a\\u00a0global campaign, originating in Germany, in which so-called \\\"doctors for the truth\\\" promoted false COVID-19 cures, rejected the use of face masks and suggested the pandemic was a \\\"plan of global domination\\\".\", \"According to the open letter, \\\"millions\\\" of other YouTube users were \\\"watching videos in Greek and Arabic that encouraged them to boycott vaccinations or treat their COVID-19 infections with bogus cures\\\".\", \"Away from the pandemic, the fact checkers drew attention to the platform's role in amplifying hate speech and election disinformation.\", \"Measures proposed by the fact-checking organisations as a means of stemming the tide of misinformation included a commitment from YouTube to \\\"meaningful transparency\\\", the provision of context and debunking of misinformation in collaboration with fact checkers, and firmer action against repeat offenders, with all steps to be taken in a multitude of languages.\", \"In a statement to the US-based Poynter Institute, which oversees the IFCN, YouTube spokeswoman Elena Hernandez\\u00a0said\\u00a0the company had \\\"invested heavily\\\" in policies to combat

operate to connect people to authoritative content, reduce the spread of borderline misinformation, and remove violative videos.\\\"\", \"According to the spokeswoman, YouTube had seen \\\"important

parent company, Tencent, refuted claims the account had been hacked, stating that there was no evidence of \\\"third-party intrusion\\\".\", \"\\\"Based on our information, this appears to be a
