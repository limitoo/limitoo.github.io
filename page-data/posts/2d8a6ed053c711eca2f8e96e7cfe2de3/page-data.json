markets, and the Australian Ginger Growers Association wants to know why.\", \"Demand for ginger spiked during the height of the pandemic and combined with a poor growing season, there was a shortage of fresh ginger worldwide over the past 12 months.\", \"In February, fresh ginger sold for around $55-$60 a kilogram in most Australian supermarkets, with at least one customer telling ABC Rural she forked out a staggering $71.99/kg in Victoria.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/9be9771792065cfc80ec0f8dce4823b4\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Danelle Burns said at $71.99/kg in her local store, she is treating fresh ginger \\\"like gold\\\".(Supplied: Danelle Burns)</div>\", \"Retail prices had doubled in a year and growers were paid around $20/kg for new season ginger and $30/kg for old season ginger, which spent\\u00a0longer in the ground and was spicier.\", \"Supply has since increased, and Australian Ginger Growers Association president Shane Templeton said recent rain had resulted in one of the \\\"best starts\\\" for new ginger crops in a \\\"very long time.\\\"\", \"<img

Shane Templeton is questioning prices on behalf of farmers.(ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)</div>\", \"\\\"As of today, growers are receiving around $11/kg for old season ginger and $7/kg for new season ginger at the central markets on Australia's east coast.\\\"\", \"But a price check of the three major supermarkets showed customers were still being charged $45 a kilogram for all fresh ginger at Woolworths and Coles and $39.99/kg at Aldi.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f6c3339a0a53e14cbfd8374bd14b0344\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

relationships with supermarkets \\u2014 and he did not\\u00a0know what supermarket costs were.\", \"But with 80 per cent of Australia's ginger grown for the fresh market, he was concerned that consumers could be put off by high retail prices.\", \"\\\"Farmers are the ones who are putting all the work in, you're out there in the rain, and you're paying wages, you're taking all the risk on and we're the ones getting the least return,\\\" Mr Templeton said.\", \"Richard Shannon manages policy and advocacy for Growcom, Queensland's peak horticulture industry group.\", \"\\\"For example, in the last 12 months, the price of tomatoes at farm gate has been 80 cents/kg, and in some supermarkets, it's been $8/kg, which is a tenfold increase, and obviously difficult, I think, to justify.\", \"\\\"We do appreciate that there are transport logistics and a cold chain, the supermarkets themselves have their own costs, in terms of real estate, staff \\u2026 but a better understanding of what it costs to get our products to market would be really helpful to better understand when these price discrepancies do arise.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Ginger growers supply wholesale

price discrepancies from the ABC, a Woolworths spokesperson said: \\\"Unlike other varieties of produce, for which Woolworths buys the majority through direct relationships with growers, ginger is sourced through wholesale markets, with prices set by wholesalers.\\\"\", \"Coles said it paid above-market prices to its direct suppliers.\", \"\\\"We have long-term contracts with ginger growers in Queensland and source a small volume through the markets in Sydney and Melbourne to ensure we can continue to meet customer demand year-round,\\\" a spokesperson said.\", \"An Aldi spokesperson did not want to comment on the factors determining retail ginger prices other than to say its \\\"prices remained consistently lower than its competitors\\\".\", \"<img

Shannon said.\", \"An Australian Competition and Consumer Commission spokesperson said that \\\"Neither the Horticulture Code nor the Food and Grocery Code exerts any control over the setting of
