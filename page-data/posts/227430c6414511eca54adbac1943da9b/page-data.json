But one morning, at the age of 45, he woke up and realized that he had yet to embrace his full potential. He wanted to break into Bollywood.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve always loved performing, and I was listening to Indian classical and devotional music a lot,\\u201d at the time, Mr. Klein said. The 2001 Bollywood epic \\u201cLagaan\\u201d inspired him to try and make his passion his profession. \\u201cThings have come full circle,\\u201d he said, adding that he appears in the 2022 film \\u201cLal Singh Chaddha\\u201d with Aamir Khan, who starred in \\u201cLagaan.\\u201d\", \"Six months after that fateful morning, Mr. Klein, who is divorced and has no children, moved to Mumbai. At first, he lived in the coastal metropolis part time. He alternated between a gig editing subtitles for English-language television shows in Mumbai and tutoring back in California, where he would make enough money to underwrite another six months of trying to make it in the performing arts world in India.\", \"Eventually it paid off. Mr. Klein, now 55, has appeared in dozens of Indian films, television shows and commercials, playing such varied roles as a scientist, doctor, chef, spy, and, owing to his ability to nail a British accent, quite often, a \\u201cmean British officer.\\u201d\", \"Making the change was not without strife. Still, he said he would do it all over again. \\u201cI\\u2019m in India, you know, the land of reincarnation,\\u201d Mr. Klein said, \\u201cbut as far as I\\u2019m concerned, I have this one life that I\\u2019m dealing with. I want to make the most of it.\\u201d (The following interview has been edited and condensed.)\", \"What was your life like before you made this change?\", \"I had been living in the San Francisco Bay Area for about 20 years. Mostly, I was a teacher: math, science, computer lab. My nights and weekends were spent doing some kind of performing arts. I\\u2019ve always had an affinity toward music. I remember being a little kid, walking through the park, singing. A stranger walked by, and I sort of got quiet. My mom said: \\u201cDon\\u2019t be shy. You sing out loud and don\\u2019t worry about anybody else.\\u201d\", \"What was the watershed moment?\", \"I was working as a teacher at a Hebrew day school, and one morning I woke up and thought, \\u201cIf I don\\u2019t do something, I could be here for the next 20 years.\\u201d That wouldn\\u2019t be a terrible outcome, but it wasn\\u2019t the one I wanted.\", \"I studied India in graduate school, when I was pursuing a degree in religion. Learning about India inspired me to adopt the nickname Bhakti, which I\\u2019ve used since 1991, though I never changed my name legally. In a broad sense, Bhakti means devotion and love. The word is a reminder to lead with my heart instead of my head, so every time I hear my name, I think of that.\", \"My first trip to India was in 1995 as a backpacker. I absolutely loved it. I went back a few times after that. So I thought: what if I go there, stay, and see what happens? On one of my first nights in Mumbai, I went out to a jazz club. All the performers were foreigners. We got to talking afterward, and I ended up joining their group as a singer, which was my first foray into the performing arts world here.\", \"What was the biggest challenge that you had to navigate?\", \"When I first arrived, I was staying in fairly cheap places. A lot of times, there was no hot water in the shower. A lot of times there wasn\\u2019t even a shower \\u2014 most of my time in India, I\\u2019ve taken a bucket bath, which is actually great.\", \"How did you go from editing subtitles to acting in Bollywood productions?\", \"About four years after moving to Mumbai, I started getting opportunities for voice-over work: corporate presentations, TV and radio commercials that wanted an American or British accent. Then I started getting calls to dub Bollywood movies. Then I got invited to audition to act.\", \"At first, I got background parts. And then, because I\\u2019m blessed with an American accent and some vocal training, I started auditioning for and getting speaking roles.\", \"It was a godsend. It was another miracle of India. To be able to learn a new art form now is so incredibly beautiful and such an amazing opportunity.\", \"What\\u2019s next for you?\", \"I want to keep going with the acting. There\\u2019s so much more to learn. I\\u2019m getting a lot of good feedback, and the parts are getting better, and they\\u2019re getting more varied. I don\\u2019t always play a mean British officer anymore. I\\u2019m getting other kinds of roles, bigger roles, and I\\u2019m getting more respect. I\\u2019m in a beautiful, sci-fi love story called \\u201cX = Prem\\u201d that comes out in February. It\\u2019s my fourth time working with the director, Srijit Mukherji.\", \"Otherwise, I just want to live every day in this amazing country.\", \"How has this new act changed you?\", \"Being here gives me the opportunity to be the best version of myself. I wasn\\u2019t feeling that opportunity in the U.S. I feel like people here see me the way I want to be seen. I don\\u2019t know why. I honestly feel like it boils down to the ridiculous love that I have for this place.\", \"What advice would you give to people who are stuck and looking to make a big change?\", \"Dream a big dream, then figure out what all the little incremental steps are to get there, and hit those steps one by one. There are always obstacles. Loved ones can be an obstacle, money can be an obstacle. It\\u2019s not easy. There\\u2019s lots of sacrifice involved, but you can dream a big dream and make it come true.\", \"\", \"We\\u2019re looking for people who decide that it\\u2019s never too late to switch gears, change their life and pursue dreams.
