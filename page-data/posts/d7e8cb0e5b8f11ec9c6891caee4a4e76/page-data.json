But the government raised the Covid alert level from three to four \\u2014 its second-highest level \\u2014 amid signs that Omicron was spreading rapidly throughout the country.\", \"In raising the alert level, the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, declared in a statement that the \\u201cearly evidence shows that Omicron is spreading much faster than Delta and that vaccine protection against symptomatic disease from Omicron is reduced.\\u201d\", \"Under what Mr. Johnson called the \\u201cOmicron Emergency Boost,\\u201d the government will offer booster shots to adults ages 18 and older by New Year\\u2019s Day. Adults are eligible for a booster shot three months after their second shot. Britain has distributed 23.1 million booster shots, reaching 40.2 percent of people aged 12 and above.\", \"To reach the new goal, Mr. Johnson said the National Health Service would have to defer some other medical procedures between now and the end of the year. He said the government would deploy 42 military planning units to help open additional vaccination centers and mobile units.\", \"\\u201cIf we don\\u2019t do this now, the wave of Omicron could be so big that cancellations and disruptions, like the loss of cancer appointments, would be even greater next year,\\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \\u201cTo hit the pace we need, we\\u2019ll need to match the N.H.S.\\u2019s best vaccination day yet \\u2014 and then beat it day after day.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis will require an extraordinary effort,\\u201d he added.\", \"The videotaped address seemed calculated in part to seize the offensive in advance of a politically perilous week in which Mr. Johnson will face a difficult vote in Parliament on Covid restrictions he announced last week, as well as by an election in which the Conservative Party is at risk of losing a once-safe seat.\", \"Mr. Johnson faces a potential mutiny by members of his Conservative Party, who have threatened to vote against the new restrictions, which include urging people to work from home, wear face masks in more indoor settings, and to show a vaccine certification to enter nightclubs, and events with large audiences.\", \"The prime minister\\u2019s credibility has also come under question after reports that members of his staff held Christmas parties in 10 Downing Street, at a time when the public was instructed not to meet with friends or family members.\"]","href_hash":"d7e8cb0e5b8f11ec9c6891caee4a4e76"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d7e8cb0e5b8f11ec9c6891caee4a4e76"}},
