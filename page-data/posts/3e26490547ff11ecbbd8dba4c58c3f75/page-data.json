Stitt asked Austin to suspend the mandate in Oklahoma, but Austin has yet to formally respond.\", \"An anonymous senior defense official told the AP that governors do not have the authority to relieve the Guard of their military medical readiness requirements, and members who do not comply with the mandate will risk losing their jobs.\", \"However, who has the highest authority over the Guard is proving to be murky. When the Guard is on active state duty, they are paid by the state. But, when training or responding to larger disasters, they are paid by the federal government. In both instances, they report to the governor.\", \"Pentagon officials said Austin has the authority to set medical readiness requirements for the entire force, including the National Guard. They said the vaccine is critical to ensuring any Guard member is healthy enough to deploy at a moment's notice.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935037/lloyd-austin-defense-secretary.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has yet to formally respond to Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt's request to not require a National Guard vaccine mandate in Oklahoma.

Stitt's spokeswoman, Carly Atchison, said that about 89 percent of the Air Guard has been vaccinated. A military official said the Oklahoma Air Guard is expected to reach about 95 percent by the deadline. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss statistics not yet public.\", \"About 40 percent of Oklahoma Army Guard members are vaccinated, Atchison said. The Army Guard is not required to be vaccinated until June.\", \"Defense officials have declined to provide specifics on how the mandate will be enforced and how Guard troops may be disciplined or administratively processed out of the Guard and how quickly that could happen. They also won't say whether commanders who decline to enforce the mandate will also be subject to any punishment.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935038/oklahoma-governor-kevin-stitt.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt sent a memo to the state's National Guard telling them they are not required to get vaccinated, going against the Pentagon's vaccine mandate.
