There was so much abundance that it taxed our attentions, and even highly anticipated titles seemed to come and go quietly. I wish I had more space to highlight all of the books I read and loved in 2021, but these seven collections were personal favorites, and the ones I most want to share.\", \"BLOOD ON THE FOG, by Tongo Eisen-Martin. (City Lights, 107 pp., paper, $15.95.) Reminiscent of June Jordan in their near-embrace of violence, these poems have a powerful ambivalence about what effect they might have in the world; they are very aware of being poems: \\u201cA non-future dripping with real people/I mean, real people \\u2026 Not poem people.\\u201d \\u201cI write poems today/I kill america today.\\u201d \\u201cHas the poem started yet?/I will tuck your shirt into the earth.\\u201d The language is visionary, sometimes trancelike. \\u201cIt takes a violent middleman for me to talk to myself.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to make you relive all of this, Lord \\u2026 Lord, is that my revolver in your hand?\\u201d \\u201cI am weak first/Before anything, I first become weak.\\u201d \\u201cthere goes the poet \\u2014 killing without killing \\u2014 don\\u2019t mind this.\\u201d Words are not the revolution itself, Eisen-Martin seems to say, and yet this book disturbed me more than any other I read this year. It reminds me that poetry can rewire our thinking \\u2014 can actually change our minds \\u2014 by using nothing like the rote language we\\u2019re so used to hearing in speech and in prose. It can jolt us out of patterns, back into intelligence.\", \"LITTLE ELEGIES FOR SISTER SATAN, by Michael Palmer. (New Directions, 117 pp., paper, $16.95.) It was a good year for our older poets, with new books by legends like Frank Bidart and Louise Gl\\u00fcck, and this, with its stunning first sequence of elegies that call to mind Rilke, Celan, Inger Christensen \\u2014 there\\u2019s a way that even poetry written in one\\u2019s native tongue already feels translated, as though the language of the mind were always foreign. \\u201cOh, body, where are you going,/body of the earth, lost/double, lost copy of the body/mute body of yesterday/in tomorrow\\u2019s shredded cloth?\\u201d These are poems about confronting the end, the end of one\\u2019s own time and time in general, about repetition (\\u201cThat is why, each day, when I return/to the illegible page/I must begin again/from the beginning\\u201d; \\u201cLet us begin, let us begin again/not from the beginning but from the end\\u201d) and the paradox of poetry, its ability to say the unsayable, to exist and yet remain unsaid, the utility of futility. \\u201cWhen I think of \\u2018possible worlds,\\u2019 I think not of philosophy, but of elegy. And impossible worlds. Resistant worlds.\\u201d \\u201cNever beg for mercy/from the poem,/since it can offer none./Do not ask/what language it speaks,/since the answer is none.\\u201d\", \"LOVE AND OTHER POEMS, by Alex Dimitrov. (Copper Canyon, 119 pp., paper, $17.) A highly pleasurable, heavily Frank O\\u2019Hara\\u2013influenced collection in love with moments and New York City and the aesthetics of cyclical ephemerality (see \\u201cNovember\\u201d: \\u201cIs the first snow just snow./It feels like more\\u201d), full of exuberance and wistfulness, longing and joy. The poet is present as a self-referential persona. The last long poem, written over the course of two years in the back of different cabs, is a highlight: \\u201cOnce I was 19/and now I\\u2019m 33 \\u2026 When I was younger/all I wanted was to be taken seriously./A serious poet! Why not./Now I realize being taken seriously/is as arbitrary as how long you live./I would gladly trade wisdom for youth.\\u201d\", \"RETURNING THE SWORD TO THE STONE, by Mark Leidner. (Fonograf Editions, 85 pp., paper, $16.) Leidner is a comic genius, which is to say this book is both hilarious and profound. Every time I have attempted to read \\u201cI\\u2019m Running for President\\u201d out loud, I have cried laughing: \\u201cI sew closed the neckholes of my sweatshirts/then sew beltloops along their bottom hems/and slide my legs through the sleeves/because I wear sweatshirts like pants\\u2014/and I cut the crotches out of all my sweatpants/for my head to go through/because I wear sweatpants like shirts/with my arms through the legs/and I\\u2019m running for President.\\u201d But then there are also lines like this: \\u201cLife is long for a brief time/then brief for a long time.\\u201d\", \"THE SUNFLOWER CAST A SPELL TO SAVE US FROM THE VOID, by Jackie Wang. (Nightboat, 131 pp., paper, $16.95.) Wang is working in a kind of combination of the vivid surrealist, fabulist, scary-funny dream logic of James Tate and something more argumentative, theory-laced, dialectical, like Anne Boyer. The poems employ oneiromancy as strategy, because \\u201cinterpretation itself is always strategic \\u2026 politically and personally enabling.\\u201d Here dreams are spaces of radical possibility, and as in the real world, the possibilities are sometimes magical (Kant arrives at a party, so \\u201cdrugs are unnecessary\\u201d) and sometimes nightmarish (\\u201cYou have put yourself at the center of the battle of cosmic forces and lowered your sword./Because you were willing to die, you will be spared./But \\u2026 /But\\u201d) and sometimes both, like dress rehearsals for the apocalypse (\\u201cIn the dream I was someone clear-headed and focused under pressure. The problem didn\\u2019t consume me; all there was to do was solve it\\u201d).\", \"THE VAULT, by Andr\\u00e9s Cerpa. (Alice James Books, 85 pp., paper, $17.95.) A teacher once told me that a poem should be like a spider web \\u2014 if you touch any part, the rest of it will tremble. This whole book feels like that, full of delicate resonance, motifs of color, weather as mood. The \\u201csilence in the seam with which to break pills\\u201d trembles when we reach \\u201cthree seamless moments,\\u201d whenever anything seems. Consisting of two long poems, open and spacious, it evokes a real sense of lived-through time, of time as a problem to solve over and over. \\u201cNowhere compiles with precision/like dust into books.\\u201d \\u201cI want the past like a harvest again.\\u201d \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t draw my own face if god asked.\\u201d \\u201cI feel old/like I\\u2019ve only been alive today.\\u201d Elegiac and clean and cold, \\u201cThe Vault,\\u201d in its trueness, reminds me of Robert Lowell\\u2019s description of Plath\\u2019s posthumously published work: It \\u201cmakes one feel at first reading that almost all other poetry is about nothing.\\u201d\", \"WINGS IN TIME, by Callie Garnett. (The Song Cave, 98 pp., paper, $18.95.) There was a period last year when, everyone being understandably miserable, it was fashionable to pre-complain about all the awful books that were surely being written during and about the pandemic, to loudly dread the future when these ill-begotten books would be foisted upon us. As it happens I\\u2019ve already read several great pandemic books, this one among them. It refers to itself a few times as \\u201cscrappy,\\u201d meaning both, I think, resourceful/tough, and fashioned from scraps. (I like the way the word \\u201cscrappy\\u201d connotes something like crappiness, but in an affectionate way.) Both free and exact, the poems identifiably arise from a specific consciousness, or what we sometimes call a soul. \\u201cThe virus possibility/is heavy today; I sense a reclamation/Of the past occurring, so remotely,/but what past? \\u2026 I read about a woman whose life in ninety/Seconds changed./Well, mine is changing/slowly.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f4b8db1459a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f4b8db1459a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}},
