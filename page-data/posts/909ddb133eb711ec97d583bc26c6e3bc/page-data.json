The price of the card being sold by Showtime also helps fund the fighters\\u2019 payouts \\u2014 a reported $50 million total for the main event alone.\", \"The fighters will not divide that money evenly, of course. \\u00c1lvarez, who is known as Canelo, is guaranteed a reported $40 million, and the payday is a nod to his status as one of the top draws in boxing. His most recent bout, a knockout win over Billy Joe Saunders, attracted more than 73,000 spectators to AT&T Stadium. The money also acknowledges \\u00c1lvarez\\u2019s status as the sport\\u2019s top pound-for-pound fighter, unless Plant upsets him on Saturday night.\", \"Here are some other key subplots:\", \"\\u00c1lvarez, who is Mexico\\u2019s highest-profile active boxing star, would have preferred to fight Plant on Sept. 18, which would have lined up near Mexican Independence Day and made the title bout part of a broader celebration. His record features five Independence weekend title fights, and six more on Cinco de Mayo weekend.\", \"By midsummer, a deal for a September bout was nearly finalized \\u2014 and then it fell apart.\", \"\\u00c1lvarez and Plant agreed to terms by August, for a fight scheduled for November 6. The new contract satisfied both fighters, but the new date would place it in direct competition with U.F.C. 268 for sports fans\\u2019 attention and pay-per-view dollars.\", \"Caleb Plant is forthright about his tough upbringing. He, his sister and his father, Richie, lived in a mobile home in tiny Ashland City, Tenn. Plant has told reporters that the trailer grew frigid every winter and unbearably hot every summer, but also says the experience has made him nearly bulletproof as a boxer.\", \"\\u201cYou can\\u2019t break a poor boy\\u2019s chin,\\u201d Plant has said repeatedly in the run-up to his bout against \\u00c1lvarez.\", \"For his part, \\u00c1lvarez is familiar with Plant\\u2019s mantra, and, in an October interview, dismissed it with a smirk and a wave of his hand.\", \"\\u201cHe talks about where he\\u2019s from and what he\\u2019s been through so people feel sorry for him,\\u201d said \\u00c1lvarez, who grew up in Guadalajara, Mexico. \\u201cBut we all come from the same side. I was poor, too, but I don\\u2019t talk about it so people will feel sorry for me.\\u201d\", \"An upset win by Caleb Plant might actually simplify things for Showtime, the pay-per-view platform airing the fight card. Plant might lack \\u00c1lvarez\\u2019s star power and built-in audience, but he is signed to Premier Boxing Champions, a managerial outfit that partners with Fox and Showtime on boxing programming. A Plant win guarantees that the next super-middleweight title bout will land on a P.B.C.-partnered platform.\", \"But if \\u00c1lvarez, a promotional and broadcast free agent, wins on Saturday, Showtime will have to compete with other platforms for his next fight. This fight landed on Showtime because P.B.C. had Plant, and Plant owned the International Boxing Federation title, which \\u00c1lvarez wanted. If \\u00c1lvarez wins, Showtime will have to attempt to lure him back.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s understandable, given that he wants the biggest, legacy defining fights available at this point in his career,\\u201d said Stephen Espinoza, president of Showtime Sports. \\u201cWe\\u2019re optimistic that we\\u2019ll be able to continue the relationship. We look forward to doing a successful event, and continuing to work with both Canelo and Plant in the future.\\u201d\", \"\\u00c1lvarez \\u2019s two bouts with Gennadiy Golovkin reportedly generated a combined 2.4 million pay-per-view buys, impressive numbers which help explain his appeal to boxing broadcasters. From December 2018 until this past May, \\u00c1lvarez fought exclusively on the streaming service DAZN, first under a contract with Golden Boy, his former promoter, and then as a free agent in a series of one-offs.\", \"DAZN officials had hoped to arrange a third \\u00c1lvarez-Golovkin bout. \\u00c1lvarez has said he is not interested. Showtime could entice Saturday\\u2019s winner with potential matchups against undefeated contender David Benavidez, or Jermall Charlo, a middleweight champion open to moving up a weight class.\"]","href_hash":"909ddb133eb711ec97d583bc26c6e3bc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"909ddb133eb711ec97d583bc26c6e3bc"}},
