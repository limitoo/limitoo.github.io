Rittenhouse, 17 at the time, drove across state lines from Antioch, Illinois, armed with an AR-15 rifle during the protests against the killing of Jacob Blake by police officers. He ultimately shot and killed two people in Kenosha and injured a third. He claimed to have gone to the protests to protect a business in the area and provide medical help.\", \"This is not the first time that Moseley has compared Rehl's case to other famous legal proceedings. Last month, while attempting to get Rehl a pre-trial release from jail, the attorney invoked the case of Richard Jewell, who was falsely accused of setting up a bomb at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.\", \"\\\"In 1996, the FBI rushed to assume that Security Guard Richard Jewell who actually warned of finding the bomb before it went off was the bomber,\\\" Mosely wrote. \\\"Indeed, will a mad rush to accuse Zachary Rehl as being a James Bond supervillain mastermind end up compromising the Government's prosecution of those actually responsible for violent confrontations with police officers?\\\"\"]","href_hash":"917879de4a5b11ecb21d7f120770ce69"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"917879de4a5b11ecb21d7f120770ce69"}},
