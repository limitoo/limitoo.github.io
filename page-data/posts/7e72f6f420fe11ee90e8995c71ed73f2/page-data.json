This has humbled me more than you can know,\\\" she said, according to CBS Austin. \\\"I am willing  to  change my social media practices, and I will never livestream a  surgery  again.\\\"\", \"A medical board member was unmoved, CBS Austin reported. \", \"\\\"We've  seen an extreme lack of professionalism. Her posts are done  as a  marketing ploy,\\\" the board member said. \\\"Dr.  Grawe's  social media was more important to her than the lives of the  patients  she treated.\\\"\", \"Neither Grawe nor her lawyers responded to Wednesday messages from the Associated Press seeking comment. Grawe's TikTok account is currently private.\", \"The board warned Grawe about her actions as early as 2018, citing  concerns over patient privacy and possible ethics violations, according  to a previous board suspension notice.\", \"The notice also listed three patients of Grawe's who suffered severe  complications and needed intense medical care after she operated on  them. One woman's intestine was found to be perforated a week after her  surgery, a procedure that Grawe partially livestreamed on TikTok.\", \"The unnamed patient suffered severe damage to and bacterial  infections in her abdomen, as well as loss of brain function from the  amount of toxins in her blood, according to the notice.\", \"At the board meeting Wednesday, former patient Mary Jenkins, who went to Grawe for breast reconstructive surgery after battling cancer, expressed relief at the decision.\", \"\\\"It's finally over,\\\" she told CBS Austin. \\\"That chapter in my life is finally over, but I will never forget.\\\"\", \"While Ohio's state medical board can only affect doctors' rights to practice in the state, disciplinary actions are reported to the National  Practitioner Databank and posted online.\"]","href_hash":"7e72f6f420fe11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7e72f6f420fe11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
