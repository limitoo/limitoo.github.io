Álvarez feels he can burnish his legacy by taking all the major belts at 168 pounds.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-05T18:26:31.000Z","content":"[\"LAS VEGAS \\u2014 Sa\\u00fal \\u00c1lvarez and Caleb Plant punctuated their late-September news conference in Beverly Hills the way prizefighters often do \\u2014 by squaring off for a stare-down, nose to nose, each promising to beat the other down when they finally met for the undisputed super-middleweight title. That bout is scheduled for Saturday night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.\", \"For \\u00c1lvarez, the 168-pound champion in the World Boxing Association, World Boxing Council and World Boxing Organization, it was a routine performance. A 31-year-old from Guadalajara, Mexico, he knew the confrontation would help hype their bout but said he preferred not to invest energy in prefight photo ops.\", \"For Plant, the International Boxing Federation champion, the news conference stare-down was personal, as he says all of his bouts are. \\u00c1lvarez, who goes by the nickname Canelo, isn\\u2019t just a competitor, but a rival.\", \"Yet as the boxers inched closer, their trash talk increasing in volume and venom, it was \\u00c1lvarez, the veteran of 59 pro bouts, who professed not to like outside-the-ring skirmishes, who responded to an insult \\u2014 he says Plant called him a vulgar name \\u2014 with a two-handed shove. Plant bounced back and threw a left hand. \\u00c1lvarez answered with a right and left, all the blows delivered and answered in a split second.\", \"Photos and video replays would show that the fighters had actually traded openhanded slaps. Plant\\u2019s fingertips grazed \\u00c1lvarez\\u2019s cheek and temple. \\u00c1lvarez connected with the ridge of his right palm and the heel of his left palm.\", \"Even now, just before their bout, it\\u2019s still unclear how, exactly, a single swear word triggered the scuffle. \\u00c1lvarez said he thought that Plant intended the gravest insult possible.\", \"\\u201cIt got out of control. I\\u2019ve never been involved in anything like that. The truth is, I don\\u2019t like it at all. I\\u2019m going to take it out on him in the ring,\\u201d \\u00c1lvarez said.\", \"Plant, for his part, said both fighters used the word. It\\u2019s audible in video of the skirmish featured in Showtime\\u2019s prefight documentary series. The voice sounds like \\u00c1lvarez\\u2019s.\", \"\\u201cIt was just normal prefight banter,\\u201d Plant, who is 21-0 with 12 knockouts, said in an interview. He added: \\u201cThat\\u2019s the fight game, and if people don\\u2019t like it, they can watch Little League Baseball.\\u201d\", \"A news conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday unfolded with no such drama. \\u00c1lvarez and Plant posed for photos separately, then left the stage without the customary face-off.\", \"While it\\u2019s still unclear which of the two fighters incited the skirmish in September, the stakes for Saturday\\u2019s fight are unambiguous. \\u00c1lvarez holds three world championships at 168 pounds. Plant holds one. The winner will emerge as the division\\u2019s undisputed champion.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s really important for me because few fighters in history have done it. None in Latin America,\\u201d \\u00c1lvarez, whose only loss was to Floyd Mayweather in 2013, said. \\u201cThis is the most important fight of my career.\\u201d\", \"Professional boxing has 17 weight classes but features only one reigning undisputed champion: Josh Taylor of Scotland, at 140 pounds.\", \"Holding four titles simultaneously requires aligning all four major sanctioning bodies\\u2019 priorities, a nearly impossible act. After defeating Deontay Wilder last month, the W.B.C. heavyweight champion Tyson Fury made clear his desire to unify the heavyweight title in 2022 against the winner of a springtime rematch between Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr Usyk. But the W.B.C. wants Fury to defend his belt against the English heavyweight Dillian Whyte and could strip him of the title if he chooses otherwise.\", \"Factor in the sport\\u2019s competing promoters and broadcast platforms, who typically cooperate as willingly as Democrats and Republicans in Congress, and the goal of a unified title becomes even more elusive. Bipartisan bouts happen if the stakes are high enough. Top Rank worked with Premier Boxing Champions on the two most recent Fury-Wilder fights, and the rival outfits will partner again when the welterweight champion Terence Crawford fights Shawn Porter on Nov. 20.\", \"In this environment, \\u00c1lvarez, a promotional and broadcast free agent, operates like an independent, making the fights he wants, on all sides of boxing\\u2019s promotional divides, for the money he commands. For Saturday\\u2019s bout, which will air on Showtime pay-per-view, \\u00c1lvarez will gross a reported $40 million, while Plant is guaranteed $10 million.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s understandable, given that \\u00c1lvarez wants the biggest, legacy-defining fights available at this point in his career,\\u201d Stephen Espinoza, the president of Showtime Sports, said. \\u201cThis is a legacy-defining fight for a fighter who already has a hall-of-fame r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9. Or it could be the elevation of Caleb Plant to an entirely new level of stardom.\\u201d\", \"\\u00c1lvarez, who has held world titles in four weight classes, will enter Saturday\\u2019s bout as the betting favorite and the A-side fighter. He\\u2019s a veteran whose tactics shift as opponents and situations dictate \\u2014 a boxer-puncher in his 2013 win over Austin Trout, and a come-forward slugger in recent wins over Billy Joe Saunders and Callum Smith.\", \"\\u201cI want to make history. That\\u2019s what motivates me,\\u201d \\u00c1lvarez, who is 56-1-2, said. \\u201cI\\u2019m still improving, every day.\\u201d\", \"Plant is a technical, tactical boxer who recognizes that a series of challengers, like Saunders and Smith, have tried and failed to beat \\u00c1lvarez with skill and strategy. Their plans unraveled in the middle rounds, when \\u00c1lvarez began landing heavy punches.\", \"But Plant, a 29-year-old from Ashland City, Tenn., promises a different outcome. He has spent his whole career as a super-middleweight, and he will enter the ring with advantages in size and reach.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s been a handful of guys who have had a good amount of success against Canelo,\\u201d Plant, a national Golden Gloves champion in 2011, said. \\u201cI\\u2019m a full-fledged super-middleweight. I possess a lot of the same skills and ring I.Q. that those guys do, but I\\u2019m 6-1 and a half.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"cc25ea5a3e6511ecadcddd468b960f38"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cc25ea5a3e6511ecadcddd468b960f38"}},
