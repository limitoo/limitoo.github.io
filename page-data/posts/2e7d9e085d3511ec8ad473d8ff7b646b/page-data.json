Wood of State Supreme Court in Westchester County, came in response to a formal request from Times lawyers on Monday. In the request, The Times asked that the order be dissolved, while also requesting that the court clarify what it could and could not publish.\", \"Justice Wood\\u2019s original order, issued on Nov. 18, came about as part of a lawsuit filed by Project Veritas in 2020 that accused The Times of defamation because of its description of the group\\u2019s reporting practices. In the order, Justice Wood ordered that The Times cease further efforts to solicit or acquire attorney-client privileged material, effectively limiting the newspaper\\u2019s ability to report on Project Veritas.\", \"The Times\\u2019s executive editor, Dean Baquet, has described the initial ruling as \\u201cunconstitutional\\u201d and \\u201ca dangerous precedent\\u201d for silencing the work of reporters.\", \"Project Veritas is under investigation by the Justice Department for its possible involvement in the theft of a diary belonging to President Biden\\u2019s daughter, Ashley. In its coverage of the investigation, The Times published an article on Nov. 11 that quoted memos prepared by lawyers for Project Veritas that commented on methods for the group to practice its style of reporting without breaking federal law. The memos predate, by several years, the libel case against The Times.\", \"The Project Veritas leader, the provocateur James O\\u2019Keefe, has used false identities and surreptitious cameras to create videos aimed at embarrassing liberals, labor groups, news outlets and Democratic politicians.\", \"After the article was published, Project Veritas filed a motion with the court, arguing that The Times had breached its right to attorney-client privilege by disseminating the memos. The group also accused the paper of trying to embarrass a litigation opponent.\", \"In his clarification on Tuesday, Justice Wood wrote that last month\\u2019s order did not bar The Times \\u201cfrom receiving attorney-client privileged material\\u201d from anyone whom Project Veritas authorized to waive privilege or from publishing \\u201csuch information and material\\u201d it had obtained that way. He also specified that The Times could publish such material if it became publicly available independent of Times action. The clarification also made clear that The Times was free to interview Project Veritas lawyers.\", \"A lawyer for Project Veritas did not immediately reply to a request for comment. In a brief filed on Dec. 1, lawyers for the group argued that The Times was \\u201cdressing up its arguments in First Amendment\\u201d law.\", \"Danielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokeswoman, said in a statement on Tuesday: \\u201cWhile these changes are welcome, we continue to believe that the order is an unconstitutional prior restraint that should be dissolved.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"2e7d9e085d3511ec8ad473d8ff7b646b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2e7d9e085d3511ec8ad473d8ff7b646b"}},
