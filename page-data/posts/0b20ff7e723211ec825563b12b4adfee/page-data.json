The fossil, which researchers said is \\\"very well-preserved,\\\" is said to be the \\\"palaeontological discovery of a lifetime,\\\" according to the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust.\", \"The fossil was found at the Rutland Water Nature Reserve in central England in February 2021, according to an announcement from the wildlife trust. Joe Davis, who works on the water conservation team for the trust, found it during a routine draining procedure for re-landscaping.\\u00a0\", \"At first, he said in a statement, he thought the remains were clay pipes sticking out of the mud, except that \\\"they looked organic.\\\" He told a colleague that they looked like vertebrae, and when they got closer, they saw \\\"what indisputably looked like a spine\\\" as well as a jawbone at the spine's end.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We couldn't quite believe it,\\\" Davis said. \\\"The find has been absolutely fascinating and a real career highlight. It's great to learn so much from the discovery and to think that this amazing creature was once swimming in seas above us.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"The fossil was excavated in August and September, and has since been identified as an ichthyosaur, a marine reptile that somewhat resembled dolphins. This particular fossil, found nearly complete, is nearly 33 feet long and is roughly 180 million years old, researchers said. Its skull measures at more than 6.5 feet long.\", \"Davis told the\\u00a0BBC that the fossil was \\\"very well-preserved, better than I think we could have all imagined.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Ichthyosaur expert Dean Lomax, who helped with the fossil's research, said that the find is the \\\"largest ichthyosaur skeleton ever discovered in Britain.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"I\\u2019m absolutely thrilled to reveal the largest ichthyosaur skeleton EVER discovered in Britain!\", \"It was an honour to lead the excavation and unearth this incredible Jurassic GIANT from its ancient rocky tomb in Rutland!
