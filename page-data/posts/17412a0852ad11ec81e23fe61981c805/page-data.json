Some reveal the grittier side of San Diego, or showcase reliably stunning views of the Central Coast.\", \"I\\u2019ve shared your recommendations below, which include productions spanning nearly half a century:\", \"\\u201cThe Rockford Files\\u201d (1974), Los Angeles\", \"\\u201cRockford may have lived in a trailer on the beach in Malibu, but he spent most of his time in less rarefied parts of L.A. As a kid in Aptos, Ventura Boulevard and downtown L.A. (long before lofts!) defined L.A. for me. Even now, when I\\u2019m in some of the more workaday sections of the Southland, something I see triggers the \\u2018Rockford Files\\u2019 theme music in my head.\\u201d \\u2014 Ryan Ver Berkmoes, Monte Rio\", \"\\u201cLou Grant\\u201d (1977), Los Angeles\", \"\\u201cThe show portrayed all sections of Los Angeles, from downtown, to the beach, to Bel-Air, to like, y\\u2019know, the Valley and stuff, and to the scruffier sections in the east and south. I first watched the show when I lived back east, and was thrilled to visit many of those locations after I moved to Southern California in the early \\u201980s.\", \"Recently, I picked up several DVD box-sets of \\u2018Lou Grant,\\u2019 and was amazed at how well the show holds up after all these years. One episode, first broadcast in 1979, dealt with undocumented immigrants. Forty-two years old, and it easily could have been written 42 minutes ago.\\u201d \\u2014 Bob Haus, Oakland\", \"\\u201cNash Bridges\\u201d (1996), San Francisco\", \"\\u201cI used to watch \\u2018Nash Bridges\\u2019 in part as a scavenger hunt trying to determine exactly where in San Francisco the scenes were filmed. I even saw the crews in action around town. There\\u2019s something special about seeing the real places you know show up onscreen.\\u201d \\u2014 Mark Jones, Sacramento\", \"\\u201cMonk\\u201d (2002), San Francisco\", \"\\u201cThe opening of the show with Monk walking to his apartment at the top of one of San Francisco\\u2019s many steep hills is priceless!\\u201d \\u2014 Chick Harrity, Calistoga\", \"\\u201cTerriers\\u201d (2010), San Diego\", \"\\u201cNot only was it a very good show with intricate plotting, crackling dialogue and great acting, it also shone a light on a bit of a seedy underbelly of the San Diego beach towns. If I recall correctly it took place in Ocean Beach.\", \"I had never seen a show that took away the fun and sun of San Diego beach culture and instead replaced it with the scrappy day-to-day (or as was often the case on this show, night-to-night) living in a part of California most people consider idyllic.\\u201d \\u2014 Dan Hess, Los Angeles\", \"\\u201cBosch\\u201d (2014), Los Angeles\", \"\\u201cMy husband and I were huge fans of \\u2018Bosch.\\u2019 Sadly, my husband died in March, and months later I finally got around to watching the last season. In the last episode, Bosch\\u2019s daughter is sitting outside Du-Par\\u2019s.\", \"I have spent the past few months moving from Connecticut to Los Angeles. I now live a mile away from there \\u2014 rounded the corner one day after first moving here and there it was.\\u201d \\u2014 Marlene Cavagnuolo, Los Angeles\", \"\\u201cLucifer\\u201d (2016), Los Angeles\", \"\\u201cMy favorite is \\u2018Lucifer\\u2019 because it shows the L.A. I remember most from 11 years lived there: the kind of morally amorphous city the devil would surely choose to live in.\\u201d \\u2014 Ney M. Fonseca Jr., Teres\\u00f3polis, Brazil\", \"\\u201cBig Little Lies\\u201d (2017), Monterey\", \"\\u201cI was born and raised on Monterey Bay. I spent much of my adult life living and working there, though not since 2005. One of my family\\u2019s greatest joys was Sunday drives around the region.\", \"I adored \\u2018Big Little Lies\\u2019 for all the iconic Central Coast, Monterey peninsula and Big Sur locations that were beautifully showcased.\\u201d \\u2014 Rhoda Flint, Bellingham, Wash.\", \"\\u201cThe Rookie\\u201d (2018), Los Angeles\", \"\\u201cThe star of the show is Los Angeles. It\\u2019s a well-done police procedural with a good cast and excellent plot. It stays interesting episode to episode.\", \"Being a former Southern California girl, I have developed a love for SoCal that I didn\\u2019t have for the first 20 years of my life.\", \"I was blown away by the detailed street-to-street detail, and the different downtown L.A. neighborhoods. The cast are all very likable and tough. Plus the diversity of the cast is what it should be, with Black and Hispanic actors making up the main characters.\\u201d \\u2014 Iris Buckley-Jacobson, Atascadero\", \"\\u201cCity of Ghosts\\u201d (2021), Los Angeles\", \"\\u201c\\u2018City of Ghosts\\u2019 on Netflix is a little miracle of a show \\u2014 humane portraits of L.A. neighborhoods outside the ones we\\u2019ve seen for years, naturalistic performances and a delightful art direction and animation style.
