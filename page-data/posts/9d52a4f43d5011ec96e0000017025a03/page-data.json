Its viral stardom made a certain kind of sense: The show follows the travails of a formerly wealthy family that finds itself marooned in a roadside motel in a nowheresville town, with little hope of returning to a familiar life and the most rudimentary tools for building a new one. Who couldn\\u2019t relate to the Roses\\u2019 slow-dawning realization that the world had irrevocably changed?\", \"This week, \\u201cSchitt\\u2019s Creek\\u201d makes its debut on the best-seller list, with \\u201cBest Wishes, Warmest Regards,\\u201d an official tie-in by the show\\u2019s father-son co-creators, Eugene Levy and Daniel Levy (who are, respectively, the patriarch and the elder sibling of the Rose family).
