On Sunday night on Maui, the Kahului Airport experienced a power outage, and several roads were closed overnight, Mr. Weintraub said.\", \"On Monday morning, officials across the state were bracing for flooding.\", \"All the islands were on a flood watch on Monday, several public schools canceled classes and the governor of Hawaii, David Ige, warned residents on Twitter, \\u201cnow is the time to make sure you have an emergency plan in place and supplies ready should you need to move away from rising water.\\u201d\", \"The mayor of Hawaii County, Mitchell Roth, declared a state of emergency on Sunday, allowing state agencies to mobilize and request assistance from the federal government in the event of a disaster.\", \"About 9,000 people in Hawaii were without power on Monday morning, according to poweroutage.us, a website that tracks power failures. State officials were anticipating that number to increase throughout the day.\", \"The eastern sections of the state, including the cities of Keaau and Hilo, could experience the heaviest rainfall on Monday, Mr. Weintraub said. The cyclone is expected to shift westward on Monday night and early Tuesday morning, the Weather Service said.\", \"Officials are preparing for \\u201cfast water rescues\\u201d in significantly flooded areas, Mr. Weintraub said.\", \"Because \\u201ceverything runs off\\u201d easily from the slick volcanic rocks of Hawaii\\u2019s natural geography, including lava and water, flooding could be severe in parts of the islands, said Mr. Roth, the meteorologist.\", \"\\u201cFor areas that are volcanic, you\\u2019re dealing with steep slopes, especially in places where people are living near the base of them \\u2014 so yeah, that\\u2019s a problem,\\u201d he said.\", \"The Weather Service said that \\u201cnumerous\\u201d landslides were expected in areas with steep terrain.\", \"\\u201cDebris in streams and gulches may clog bridges and culverts resulting in dangerous flooding,\\u201d the service said.
