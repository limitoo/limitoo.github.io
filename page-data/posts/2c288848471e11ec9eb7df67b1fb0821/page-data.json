All three groups are affiliated with the NewsGuild of New York.\", \"The Times Guild has been negotiating for a new contract since March 2021. The Wirecutter Union, formed in 2019, has yet to reach a contract. The Times has not recognized the Times Tech Guild, which was organized in April and has since filed for an election with the National Labor Relations Board.\", \"Bill Baker, the Times Guild unit chair, said at the rally that he had seen The Times \\u201cdo the right thing\\u201d in his 16 years with the union, but now \\u201ceverywhere I look, management is fighting union members at this company.\\u201d\", \"The Wirecutter Union said last week that its members would not work from Black Friday, on Nov. 26, to Cyber Monday, on Nov. 29, if it had not reached a deal by then. Nick Guy, a union chair, said that the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board last week after Times management refused to provide wage information to the union.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re actively working with The New York Times NewsGuild and the Wirecutter Union to put in place collective bargaining agreements that fairly reward our employees for their work and contributions to The Times\\u2019s success,\\u201d Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokeswoman for The New York Times, said Tuesday. She also said the company would respect the N.L.R.B. process for a Times Tech Guild election.\"]","href_hash":"2c288848471e11ec9eb7df67b1fb0821"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2c288848471e11ec9eb7df67b1fb0821"}},
