But the countdown never resumed after a final built-in hold.\", \"Despite the significance of the testing, NASA has declined to provide realtime launch control commentary because of concern export control laws might be violated if technical information is released before it can be reviewed. Instead, the agency is using social media \\u2014 tweets and blog posts \\u2014 to update reporters and the public.\", \"The helium valve problem that prevented upper stage fueling cannot be repaired at the launch pad and it's not known yet whether NASA will attempt a fourth core stage fueling test or opt to haul the rocket back to the Kennedy Space Center's iconic Vehicle Assembly Building for repairs.\", \"At that point, the agency could roll it back out to the pad for another fueling test or press ahead for launch. Or both. NASA managers have declined to outline even tentative plans beyond the now-delayed fueling test, saying they want that data in hand before making any decisions on how to proceed.\", \"The Space Launch System rocket is the most powerful launcher ever built for NASA, a key element of the agency's Artemis program to send astronauts back to the moon. With the \\\"mega rocket\\\" years behind schedule and billions over budget, NASA plans to launch an unpiloted Orion crew capsule beyond the moon and back during a maiden test flight this summer.\", \"The dress-rehearsal countdown and fueling exercise is a critical milestone on the road to launch, allowing managers and engineers to put complex ground systems and the SLS rocket through their paces under launch-day conditions for the first time.\", \"Problems are not unexpected given the huge amounts of super-cold cryogenic propellants involved and the intricate systems needed to safely manage them. A planned six-day countdown test for the first Apollo Saturn 5 moon rocket took 17 days to complete. Surprisingly, perhaps, the SLS dress rehearsal now appears likely to take even longer.\", \"Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News. He covered 129 space shuttle missions, every interplanetary flight since Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune and scores of commercial and military launches. Based at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Harwood is a devoted amateur astronomer and co-author of \\\"Comm Check: The Final Flight of Shuttle Columbia.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"3a8fb70abc3d11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3a8fb70abc3d11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
