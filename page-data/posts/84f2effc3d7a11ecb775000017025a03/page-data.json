The audience watches him struggle to write \\u201cSuperbia,\\u201d a retro-futuristic musical, while he frets about whether he should choose a more conventional career.\", \"To help you keep \\u201cSuperbia\\u201d (Larson\\u2019s never-produced musical) straight from \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!\\u201d (Larson\\u2019s autobiographical show about writing \\u201cSuperbia\\u201d) straight from \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!\\u201d the new film that tells Larson\\u2019s story, we\\u2019ve created this guide:\", \"Who was Jonathan Larson?\", \"The composer and playwright is best known as the creator of \\u201cRent,\\u201d a musical loosely based on Puccini\\u2019s 1896 opera, \\u201cLa Boh\\u00e8me.\\u201d\", \"But Larson never got to see the smash-hit success of his rock opera, which went on to win four Tony Awards. The composer died unexpectedly at age 35 in 1996 from an aortic aneurysm \\u2014 on the morning before the first Off Broadway preview of \\u201cRent\\u201d and a few months before its Broadway debut.\", \"But \\u201cRent\\u201d was hardly his first musical, and was in many ways shaped by an autobiographical show he was writing at the same time, about his struggles to write \\u201cSuperbia.\\u201d\", \"What was \\u201cSuperbia\\u201d?\", \"No up-and-coming playwright in New York City is living in the lap of luxury, but Larson\\u2019s digs were especially hardscrabble. He lived and worked in a fifth-floor walk-up in Lower Manhattan, an apartment with no heat and a bathtub in the kitchen that he shared with two roommates and a couple of cats. He would write for eight hours on days off from his weekend job waiting tables at the Moondance Diner in SoHo.\", \"The musical he was working on was \\u201cSuperbia\\u201d (based on George Orwell\\u2019s dystopian novel \\u201c1984,\\u201d even though he had been denied the rights). He won a number of grants and awards to continue writing the show, including the Richard Rodgers Development Grant, chaired by Stephen Sondheim, which paid for a workshop production at Playwrights Horizons in 1988.\", \"But effort did not equal success. Though the music and lyrics won high praise among some downtown theater people, the show was considered too big and too negative, and no producer was ready to take it on, according to a 1996 article by Anthony Tommasini in The New York Times.\", \"So, Larson decided to do a monologue.\", \"Where does \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!\\u201d come in?\", \"Not dissuaded by the flop of \\u201cSuperbia,\\u201d Larson began working on a new musical \\u2014 \\u201cRent\\u201d \\u2014 as well as another idea: an autobiographical \\u201crock monologue\\u201d that chronicled his struggles writing \\u201cSuperbia.\\u201d Initially titled \\u201c30/90\\u201d \\u2014 because he was turning 30 in 1990 \\u2014 and then \\u201cBoho Days,\\u201d the one-man show that would later become \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!\\u201d was first staged, starring Larson, in a 1990 workshop at the Second Stage Theater. The show \\u2014 part performance-art monologue, part rock recital \\u2014 captivated a young producer named Jeffrey Seller, who became a champion of Larson\\u2019s work and later persuaded his fellow producers to bring \\u201cRent\\u201d to Broadway.\", \"But \\u201cBoho Days\\u201d was difficult to pull off: Larson had to nail long monologues, often while playing several characters; sing musical numbers that represented multiple points of view; and simultaneously accompany himself on the piano and direct his band through a score that was a combination of pop, rock and Sondheim pastiche.\", \"Tommasini described the show as an \\u201cintense, angry solo\\u201d in which a man \\u201cwakes on his 30th birthday, downs some junk food and complains for 45 minutes about his frustrated ambitions, turning 30 in the tenuous \\u201990s and much more.\\u201d\", \"After the workshop, Larson continued to revise the piece, including changing the title to \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!\\u201d \\u2014 a reference to the clock he felt was continually ticking on his life and career \\u2014 and presented it at New York Theater Workshop in 1992 and 1993. It was still a work-in-progress when he died in 1996, and he left behind at least five versions of the script and a bevy of song lists.\", \"How did the solo show become a three-person musical?\", \"After Larson\\u2019s death in 1996, the playwright David Auburn, who won the Pulitzer Prize for drama for \\u201cProof,\\u201d revised the show as a three-person chamber musical that lessened the burden on the actor playing Jon. Now two additional actors played Michael, Larson\\u2019s advertising-executive best friend, and Susan, his dancer girlfriend, in addition to each portraying a variety of ancillary roles. Songs were rearranged for three voices, though the music and lyrics remained Larson\\u2019s.\", \"With the permission of Larson\\u2019s family, Auburn also excised most of Larson\\u2019s references to his terror of growing older and the feeling of being under so much pressure that his heart was about to burst in his chest, which would only seem callous given the audience\\u2019s knowledge of the composer\\u2019s fate.\", \"The revised \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!\\u201d premiered Off Broadway in 2001 at the Jane Street Theater, and went on to have a West End production, an Off West End production, two Off Broadway revivals, in 2014 and 2016, and an American national tour.\", \"Reviews were positive, with the New York Times critic Ben Brantley noting that the songs \\u201cglimmer with hints of the urgency and wit\\u201d that lend the musical score of \\u201cRent\\u201d irresistible momentum.\\u201d\", \"Miranda \\u2014 who\\u2019d found success with \\u201cIn the Heights\\u201d but had not yet debuted his smash hit \\u201cHamilton\\u201d \\u2014 played Jon in a 2014 revival at New York City Center, a performance that the Times critic Charles Isherwood said \\u201cthrobs with a sense of bone-deep identification.\\u201d\", \"Isherwood pointed out that it hadn\\u2019t been long since Miranda was \\u201cteaching high school English while scribbling songs on the side,\\u201d trying to make it as a musical-theater composer.\", \"How does the film adapt all this?\", \"Twenty years after seeing the Off Broadway revival of \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!\\u201d as a 21-year-old theater major struggling to write \\u201cIn the Heights,\\u201d Miranda directed the new film adaptation, which follows a young composer named Jon in the eight chaotic days leading up to a workshop production of his musical \\u201cSuperbia.\\u201d As in the Off Broadway revival, Larson\\u2019s rock monologue has been expanded, this time to a cast of more than a dozen characters. (Bradley Whitford now plays an encouraging Stephen Sondheim.) The film cuts between Jon\\u2019s performance of Larson\\u2019s original staging of \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!\\u201d and the story as it unfolds in real time.\", \"Miranda has said the show is a combination of Larson\\u2019s rock monologue, the 2001 Off Broadway revival, and a cinematic exploration of Larson\\u2019s thought process. He used the Library of Congress archives to craft the film\\u2019s score entirely using Larson\\u2019s music, both from \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!\\u201d and the composer\\u2019s larger body of work.\", \"\\u201cIt was like we were putting together an original musical with Jonathan Larson\\u2019s songs,\\u201d Miranda told Entertainment Weekly, explaining the process as finding the best way to \\u201cunlock\\u201d the songs and stories.\", \"Did Larson himself feel the urgency of his work? Sometimes it seems, to quote a \\u201cRent\\u201d anthem, that he understood \\u201cThere was no day but today\\u201d to do it.\"]","href_hash":"84f2effc3d7a11ecb775000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"84f2effc3d7a11ecb775000017025a03"}},
