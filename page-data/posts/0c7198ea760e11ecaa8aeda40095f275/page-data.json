Bozzi has always been one of the chosen ones, a Ken doll who runs with other Ken dolls. They\\u2019re smart, muscled and successful. They all seem to have been photographed on Barry Diller\\u2019s yacht. The Met Gala? Been there, done that, sat with Tom Ford.\", \"Mr. Bozzi recently added a vintage, shirtless photo of himself looking buff in the Hamptons to his Instagram profile. The actor-singer Cheyenne Jackson (see above qualities) left a one-word comment (\\u201csex\\u201d), and Kathy Hilton responded with five fire emojis.\", \"But even Adonises have dilemmas. Mr. Bozzi, 55, has lately been working through a tricky one.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not sure I would call it an identity crisis,\\u201d he said over lunch at the Sunset Tower in West Hollywood. \\u201cBut it has been unnerving. And it has involved an identity that I lost \\u2014 that died. So maybe \\u2018crisis\\u2019 is the right word.\\u201d\", \"For 35 years, Mr. Bozzi worked at the Palm Restaurant Group, most recently holding the title executive vice president and running its celebrity-strewn Beverly Hills outpost. He previously oversaw Palm branches in New York City, East Hampton and Washington, becoming cozy with the A-list of the A-list along the way. At one point, he orchestrated a refresh of the Palm brand and became the international chain\\u2019s public face, cooking Palm Shrimp Bruno with Al Roker on the \\u201cToday\\u201d show. (\\u201cTa-da!\\u201d) His Instagram handle was PalmStkMan.\", \"Mr. Bozzi\\u2019s restaurant career was in many ways preordained: He is the great-grandson of Pio Bozzi, who opened the first Palm in 1926 in Manhattan with John Ganzi, a fellow immigrant from Italy. Over the decades, the Palm and its offshoots became luxury clubhouses for the media, political and legal elite. \\u201cI was the fourth generation in my family to do this, and I always kind of felt like I had to see it through, that I didn\\u2019t have a choice,\\u201d said Mr. Bozzi, who was raised in Queens and, later, Manhattan.\", \"A court battle over inheritances (on the Ganzi side) ended that notion. Long, bitter story short, a judge in 2018 ruled against the chain\\u2019s owners \\u2014 Mr. Bozzi\\u2019s father and a Ganzi heir \\u2014 to the tune of $120 million, which led to bankruptcy. Landry\\u2019s, a hospitality company owned by the Texas billionaire Tilman Fertitta, bought the Palm\\u2019s remnants for $45 million in 2020. Mr. Bozzi quit as the deal was closing.\", \"\\u201cIt was a bad, bad ending to what had been a great family business,\\u201d Mr. Bozzi said. \\u201cEven though I didn\\u2019t own it, and it still exists in this new form, a part of me died.\\u201d\", \"He went silent for a minute before shaking off the gloom. \\u201cIn a way, it has been freeing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI get to do what I want. The question is: What do I want? And that question leads to more questions. Who am I? What does my life mean?\\u201d\", \"The more Mr. Bozzi thought about it, the more he realized that much of his identity came from others. He was \\u201cthe son of\\u201d at the Palm. In 2016, Mr. Bozzi married Bryan Lourd, the all-powerful Hollywood agent, and became \\u201cthe husband of.\\u201d In celebrity tabloids, Mr. Bozzi has long been identified as \\u201cthe best friend of\\u201d Andy Cohen, the boisterous media personality; they have been BFFs for nearly 30 years. (Yes, Mr. Diller has hosted them on his yacht.)\", \"\\u201cThese relationships are extremely important to Bruce,\\u201d said Sarah Jessica Parker, who has been close to Mr. Bozzi since the 1990s. \\u201cBut so much of his Palm life was about others \\u2014 everybody else, everybody else \\u2014 that I think he wants to be his own person and be seen as his own man.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Bozzi toyed with opening a restaurant of his own, maybe a bo\\u00eete with the speakeasy vibe of the original Palm. He looked at real estate in New York\\u2019s theater district but decided against it. \\u201cI still have too many wounds from the other,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Bozzi and Mr. Lourd, who live in Beverly Hills, also have a 14-year-old daughter. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to be an absentee father,\\u201d Mr. Bozzi said quietly. \\u201cI almost never saw my dad as a kid.\\u201d\", \"Instead, he has set out to become a liquor magnate and star podcaster.\", \"Mujen Spirits, founded by Mr. Bozzi and a friend, Sondra Baker, began rolling out in November. It\\u2019s a line of Japanese shochu, a colorless and odorless spirit distilled from rice. Ms. Baker\\u2019s husband, Kenneth Orkin, a start-up investor and entrepreneur, is also a Mujen partner. The moneymaking opportunities are enticing: Casamigos, the tequila brand fronted by George Clooney, sold in 2017 for roughly $1 billion, and Aviation American Gin, co-founded by Ryan Reynolds, traded in 2020 for $610 million.\", \"Mujen received a burst of publicity on Dec. 31, when Mr. Cohen and Anderson Cooper drank it while hosting CNN\\u2019s \\u201cNew Year\\u2019s Eve Live.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s like a lovely Siren licking you from the seas of Odysseus,\\u201d gushed Mr. Cooper of the alcohol, which he was sipping on the rocks. Full-on soused, Mr. Cohen let loose on topics that included politics and rival shows, generating headlines.\", \"\\u201cIt can sneak up on you,\\u201d Mr. Bozzi said afterward, with a giggle.\", \"Friendships with celebrities also inform Mr. Bozzi\\u2019s podcasting ambitions. In September, he fired off a text message to Jennifer Aniston. He has known Ms. Aniston since 1992 when, after graduating from the University of Southern California with a degree in communication, Mr. Bozzi spent several years trying with little luck to become an actor. (He worked nights at the Palm in West Hollywood.)\", \"Would \\u201cJen\\u201d be the first guest on \\u201cLunch With Bruce,\\u201d his new SiriusXM podcast series? She texted him back in under a minute to say yes.\", \"The resulting 53-minute conversation started in typical celebrity-interview fashion. Ms. Aniston dutifully recited her how-I-made-it story. He dutifully plugged \\u201cThe Morning Show.\\u201d Then Mr. Bozzi asked about her love life, and Ms. Aniston actually dropped her armor. \\u201cI think I\\u2019m ready to share myself with another,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t want to for a long time.\\u201d (Her marriage to Justin Theroux ended in divorce in 2017.)\", \"\\u201cEntertainment Tonight\\u201d raced to recycle the interview, as did People magazine and seemingly every other celebrity news outlet.\", \"Mr. Bozzi made an even bigger \\u201cLunch With Bruce\\u201d splash in October. The guest: Daniel Craig, who was staying with Mr. Bozzi and Mr. Lourd while promoting \\u201cNo Time to Die,\\u201d his final James Bond movie. (Mr. Lourd is his agent.) Instead of chatting over a meal, they reminisced over rounds of martinis \\u2014 uh, oh \\u2014 and ended up on the topic of gay bars. Mr. Craig, who is married to the actress Rachel Weisz, once partied with Mr. Bozzi at a seedy one in Los Angeles.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve been going to gay bars for as long as I can remember,\\u201d Mr. Craig said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t get into fights in gay bars.\\u201d\", \"Ka-boom! Global news coverage.\", \"\\u201cJames Bond in a gay bar is apparently a great headline,\\u201d Mr. Bozzi said, feigning innocence.\", \"Since then, Mr. Bozzi and SiriusXM have parted ways, a result, in part, of his wanting to own the podcast. He said it would return in February, perhaps with a different name (\\u201cHot Lunch\\u201d or \\u201cServed Fresh\\u201d are possibilities) and with sponsorship and distribution arranged through Kevin Huvane, a managing partner with Mr. Lourd at Creative Artists Agency.\", \"\\u201cThe chassis has been built,\\u201d Mr. Bozzi said of the podcast. \\u201cNow we\\u2019re going to lean in and make it more raw. No more working for the man!\\u201d\", \"Mr. Bozzi\\u2019s knack for drawing celebrities out of their shells (alcohol aside) reflects his time as a restaurateur, friends say. \\u201cBruce is an expert host who knows how to make everyone feel special, and that is a much harder job than anyone realizes when you are dealing with very wealthy, entitled, successful people,\\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\", \"\\u201cI remember being in an airport once with him,\\u201d Mr. Cohen continued, \\u201cand we ran into someone who I just find kind of awful. And Bruce goes up to them and gives them the biggest kiss. He\\u2019s the nicest, most welcoming and open person to everyone, and it\\u2019s so wildly annoying to me.\\u201d\", \"Because Mr. Bozzi is prone to oversharing, conversations with him rarely go where you expect.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t even have a lot of sex then,\\u201d he told me, seemingly out of nowhere, about trying to become an actor in the early 1990s, a time when he was coming to terms with his sexuality. \\u201cIt\\u2019s frankly a regret. You think you\\u2019re always going to have that 26-year-old-ness.\\u201d He paused to chug some water. \\u201cAnd now I\\u2019m on the cusp of 56. Fifty-six! I have to work hard to keep myself up \\u2014 nutrition, fitness. Luckily, I like to sweat.\\u201d\", \"I reminded him that he was speaking on the record. Yes, fine, he was aware. He then veered into his fondness for ice baths and infrared saunas; his daughter\\u2019s bus route to school; hanging out with drag queens; and Tootsie, his daughter\\u2019s pet Yorkie.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s not na\\u00efve,\\u201d Ms. Parker said. \\u201cBut he\\u2019s not ruined, either \\u2014 he\\u2019s not cynical. What you see is what you get, and that\\u2019s not typical anymore.\\u201d They call each other \\u201cSmokey,\\u201d she added, having once put heavy eye makeup on each other.\", \"There is one topic, however, that Mr. Bozzi froze up around: Mr. Lourd, who declined to be interviewed for this article.\", \"Whenever I steered the conversation toward their life together \\u2014 they dated for 10 years before marrying \\u2014 Mr. Bozzi politely shut it down. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to talk too much about that whole side of my life,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOur life is great. I\\u2019m a really lucky guy.\\u201d\", \"Awkward silence.\", \"\\u201cBryan is the introvert, and Bruce is the extrovert,\\u201d Ms. Parker said. \\u201cDuring the early part of the pandemic, Bruce had a mask with sequins on it. Bryan had whatever he could get his hands on from Duane Reade.\\u201d The \\u201cextremely private\\u201d Mr. Lourd, she added, \\u201cfinds Bruce\\u2019s flashy surface amusing.\\u201d\", \"Perhaps. But one gets the impression that Mr. Lourd wouldn\\u2019t complain if Mr. Bozzi was a bit more reserved in public. Or a lot.\", \"\\u201cI got in trouble with Bryan,\\u201d Mr. Bozzi told Mr. Craig on the podcast about their visit to the gay bar. In a 2020 appearance on Hot Takes & Deep Dives, a podcast, Mr. Bozzi told a story about how he had once kissed Madonna at a party \\u2014 \\u201cfull tongue\\u201d \\u2014 and how Mr. Lourd had (jokingly?) responded with, \\u201cI can\\u2019t take you anywhere.\\u201d\", \"During the same interview, Mr. Bozzi was asked whether Mr. Cohen, who produces the \\u201cReal Housewives\\u201d shows, would ever cast him as the franchise\\u2019s first male participant. Mr. Bozzi laughed. \\u201cBryan would say, \\u2018The minute you do it is the minute I divorce you,\\u2019\\u201d he said.\", \"In typical fashion, Mr. Bozzi then lightened the moment. Besides, he added, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what my tagline would be as I do my turn holding my diamonds.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"0c7198ea760e11ecaa8aeda40095f275"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0c7198ea760e11ecaa8aeda40095f275"}},
