Career politicians will call it radical, but to me, it's just common sense,\\\" Youngkin said in a campaign video posted on his Twitter page in September.\", \"The proposed tax elimination is one of several tax cuts that Northam plans to include in his outgoing budget proposal, in which Youngkin had encouraged the governor to include such cuts.\", \"\\\"Governor Northam's budget proposal is a step in the right direction but does not entirely fulfill Virginians' mandate,\\\" said Macaulay Porter, a Youngkin transition aide. \\\"We appreciate the Northam administration laying the foundation for these elements of the Day One game plan so that Governor-Elect Youngkin can hit the ground running on January 15th to begin executing on his key campaign promises and finish the job. \\\"\", \"If the tax is eliminated, Virginia will leave a group of 14 states that tax groceries.
