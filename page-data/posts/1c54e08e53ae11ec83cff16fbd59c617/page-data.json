Security eventually intervenes and forces the children outside, but the fight continues out there.\", \"Bermudez told Fox 13 that her son was not hurt, adding that she used the incident as a learning opportunity.\", \"\\\"I tried to use it as an opportunity to teach him if this ever happens in the future, the first thing you need to do is pull yourself away from the crowd,\\\" she said.\", \"Following last month's Astroworld tragedy\\u2014in which 10 people died as a result of crowd surge\\u2014NPR spoke with research scientist Mehdi Moussa\\u00efd, who provided useful tips to follow should someone ever find themselves trapped within a dangerous crowd.\", \"First and foremost, Moussa\\u00efd said that a person should leave the crowd the moment things start to feel wrong. But if someone is unable to leave, there are a few things that can be done to ensure survival.\", \"\\\"If you can maintain sufficient space for you to breathe, you're going to be OK. Put your arms out just in front of your chest and hold them there,\\\" he said. \\\"In this position, you would have some space, just a little bit, to push for half a centimeter or just 1 centimeter\\u2014enough for you to keep breathing.\\\"\", \"Moussa\\u00efd also said that it is important for those in crowds to remain on their feet and to avoid solid objects such as walls.\", \"Additionally, people in large crowds should not push. Instead, they should \\\"move with the crowd.\\\"\", \"\\\"If you feel a push, don't push back. Don't amplify this wave. Just go with the flow,\\\" he advised.\", \"The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office told Fox 13 that one child was detained and then later released.
