The major questions facing the team came into sharp relief.\", \"Who are the Nets without Irving? What do they do best? When will they get the James Harden of old?\", \"Despite these questions, the Nets (12-5) have figured out how to win enough to stay atop the Eastern Conference, tied with the Chicago Bulls through Sunday.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s very early for this group,\\u201d Nets Coach Steve Nash said. \\u201cSeventeen games. We\\u2019ve had multiple guys injured. We have 10 new players. A lot of guys with different backgrounds, different histories, different habits trying to blend together.\\u201d\", \"For the Nets, the early part of this season has been an exercise in figuring out who they are given their current circumstance. Irving has been barred from practicing or playing until he\\u2019s vaccinated for the coronavirus, and Harden and Durant have dealt with injuries. That has meant that sometimes the Nets don\\u2019t look like title contenders.\", \"There were certainly moments like that during their 2-point win over the bottom-dwelling Magic. Without Durant, and without a key scorer in Joe Harris, they had a big deficit early after surrendering 41 points in the first quarter. They trailed by 19 in the second quarter.\", \"This early in the season, the Nets aren\\u2019t terribly worried about struggling against subpar opponents \\u2014 particularly on nights when they are as short-handed as they were Friday.\", \"But there has been cause for concern as they take aim at a championship. Their five losses have been dramatic \\u2014 all by double digits. And they have come against teams that might stand in their way during the playoffs.\", \"They fell by 23 points to the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks and to the resurgent Chicago Bulls. Starting the season 2-3 by losing to the Bucks, Charlotte Hornets and Miami Heat raised alarm bells, as did Harden\\u2019s lackluster play during that period.\", \"\\u201cWe got to find our identity,\\u201d Harden said Tuesday after an 18-point loss to Golden State. \\u201cWe\\u2019re still a fairly new team. We got to find out what we\\u2019re good at, what we\\u2019re great at, what we can be great at.\\u201d\", \"Harden has been slowly progressing after a hamstring injury hampered him toward the end of last season. He has said the injury was a Grade 2 sprain, and required constant rehabilitation during the off-season, a time when Harden otherwise could have been working on his game and conditioning.\", \"To compound that, rule changes in officiating that have made it more difficult to draw fouls on 3-pointers have been particularly detrimental to Harden, whose ability to draw fouls has irritated opponents for years.\", \"Harden\\u2019s struggle to get foul calls has begun to lift. It wasn\\u2019t until the sixth game of the season that he reached the free-throw line for double-digit attempts. Now he\\u2019s done so in four of his last five games. He averaged at least 10 free-throw attempts per game for six straight seasons before last year, when he missed dozens of games because of injury and his wait to be traded from Houston.\", \"Harden shot 20 free throws on Friday night, making 19 of them.\", \"\\u201cI just try and attack the basket,\\u201d Harden said afterward.\", \"Nash attributed the change in part to officials better understanding how to call fouls within the parameters of the new rules.\", \"The ability to draw fouls is, of course, not the only part of Harden\\u2019s game that has needed time to resurface. He hasn\\u2019t been shooting or moving as well as he normally does, either. That\\u2019s why late in Friday\\u2019s game, he deferred to LaMarcus Aldridge.\", \"\\u201cI couldn\\u2019t finish,\\u201d Harden said. \\u201cI had plenty of opportunities. LA had it going. He got over 20,000 points, he can score the ball. So I took my time, fed him.\\u201d\", \"He made only 7 of 25 field-goal attempts for the night.\", \"The Nets\\u2019 offensive plans coming into the season depended on having Irving, Harden and Durant play together. It is in part because that hasn\\u2019t happened that the Nets have found more success defensively.\", \"\\u201cThe defense has come earlier for us than the offense,\\u201d Nash said.\", \"They rank ninth in defensive rating, which calculates points allowed per 100 possessions. They\\u2019ve allowed the 10th-fewest points per game and the fourth-lowest field goal percentage per game.\", \"The bigger picture helps create a sense of calm around the organization.\", \"\\u201cI think everybody\\u2019s trying to put a lot of pressure on us because they didn\\u2019t think we started the way we should,\\u201d Bruce Brown said the morning of the Magic game. \\u201cBut I think we\\u2019re fine.\\u201d\", \"They have a veteran-laden team, even beyond Harden and Durant, and those veterans remind them not to get too wrapped up in the ebbs and flows of the early part of the season. Patty Mills, Blake Griffin and Aldridge have a combined 38 years of N.B.A. experience.\", \"\\u201cWe know what\\u2019s at stake here,\\u201d said DeAndre\\u2019 Bembry, who started Friday in place of Durant. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been around. We know what\\u2019s going on and we want to win a championship, so that\\u2019s also the biggest thing for us because we\\u2019re looking forward to trying to do that.\\u201d\", \"Nash made waves last week when he declared after the Golden State game that his team wasn\\u2019t yet among the top teams in the league.\", \"His take on the team, though, is a bit more nuanced than that.\", \"\\u201cI feel proud of the guys,\\u201d Nash said. \\u201cThey\\u2019ve dealt with some things so far this year and continued to work for us.\\u201d\", \"He added later: \\u201cFor them to have 12 wins at this stage of the season is a credit to their professionalism and effort.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8a7316a04c6111eca29b6f2e57ed8dc4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8a7316a04c6111eca29b6f2e57ed8dc4"}},
