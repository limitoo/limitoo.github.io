I know! Now you get to find out if watching live theater about the pandemic, during a pandemic, is your thing. And because it\\u2019s set in the pandemic, there are mentions of death, illness, poverty, mental health stressors, racism, trauma.\\u201d A pause, and then she adds one more possible trigger: \\u201cThe last U.S. president.\\u201d\", \"Truth be told, I have not been clamoring for theater about dire recent events. And I confess that, en route to Wong\\u2019s show, I was feeling particularly ground down by all the barefaced people I\\u2019d seen, once again, on the subway.\", \"Yet \\u201cKristina Wong, Sweatshop Overlord\\u201d turns out to be a spiky comic tonic for just such gloom. Directed by Chay Yew, it\\u2019s the first post-shutdown live performance at New York Theater Workshop, and it\\u2019s ideally suited as such: almost a debriefing after the crisis we have endured, even though we haven\\u2019t reached its end.\", \"Don\\u2019t be fooled by the bluster in the show\\u2019s title. The tale that Wong tells isn\\u2019t truly self-aggrandizing. It\\u2019s about the Auntie Sewing Squad, a far-flung group of volunteers she assembled from her home in Los Angeles in March 2020 to make face masks, which were desperately needed then and perilously hard to come by. Selflessness and human connection are dominant themes of this narrative.\", \"\\u201cSweatshop Overlord\\u201d is also about mothers and daughters and heritage \\u2014 sewing skills passed down from one generation of Asian American women to the next \\u2014 and how at a time of horrific anti-Asian bigotry and violence in this country, some of those women harnessed perennially undervalued skills for an urgent common good. Amid corrosive cultural discord, as President Trump and others loudly blamed Asians for the coronavirus, they acted with a kind of ferocious grace.\", \"Wong, whose Zoom version of the show was part of New York Theater Workshop\\u2019s online programming last May, didn\\u2019t mean the Auntie Sewing Squad to last more than a few weeks.\", \"\\u201cThere is a rumor that the U.S. post office will be delivering five masks to every address in America,\\u201d she tells the audience, one month into the project, \\u201cand that will make us obsolete very soon.\\u201d\", \"Remember that rumor? \\u201cSweatshop Overlord\\u201d is full of little memory jolts like that. Those deliveries never happened, of course, and Wong\\u2019s group grew to include hundreds of people \\u2014 including her own mother \\u2014 who sewed more than 350,000 face masks for vulnerable communities before disbanding in August 2021.\", \"\\u201cIs America a banana republic disguised as a democracy?\\u201d Wong asks more than once, aghast at what she sees as the government\\u2019s failure to protect its citizens from the pandemic threat.\", \"Alternating dark humor and wry social commentary with anger, sorrow and fear, she tells the story of the Aunties inside the chronology we all lived through. These were ordinary Americans \\u2014 many Asian, mostly female \\u2014 enlisting in a fight for the health and well-being of their country. Sort of like a patriotic war movie in which the hostilities involve a lethal virus and belligerent resistance to mask wearing, and where people under fire volley back with the copious fruits of traditional \\u201cwomen\\u2019s work.\\u201d\", \"To immerse herself in this battle, Wong dons a wonderfully playful action-hero costume by the Tony Award winner Linda Cho. The bandoleer that Wong slings across her chest holds bright spools of thread, not bullets; a jumbo pair of scissors is strapped to her back.\", \"As vital as her humor is to the tone of the performance, the production design is just as important. The set, by Junghyun Georgia Lee, has an upstage wall made of about 1,400 surgical masks \\u2014 an ideal screen for Caite Hevner\\u2019s many projections \\u2014 but the real eye-catcher is the candy-colored sewing room laid out before it.\", \"The objects there are built on an Alice in Wonderland scale: tomato-shaped pincushions as big as chairs, a gargantuan seam ripper in royal blue, bobbins a giant could use. It feels heightened and hallucinatory, like the first year of the pandemic, but also safe, like a child\\u2019s playroom. Amith Chandrashaker\\u2019s saturated lighting aids the shift between those moods.\", \"\\u201cSweatshop Overlord\\u201d sags a bit in its last third, and one moment meant to be solemn is puzzling instead. But Wong is good company and an accomplished storyteller, and she and Yew have made a show that is both heartening and cathartic. Tripping our collective memories of a strange, scary, isolated time, it asks us to recall them together. Which helps, actually.\", \"Back out on the street afterward, we\\u2019re lighter \\u2014 and, thanks to the Aunties, imbued with hope.\", \"Kristina Wong, Sweatshop OverlordThrough Nov. 21 at New York Theater Workshop, Manhattan; nytw.org.
