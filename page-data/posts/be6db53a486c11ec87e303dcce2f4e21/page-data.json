It\\u2019s clear he was granted a remarkable degree of access to make this documentary. The camera watches from the bedside of flat-lining patients as their doctors try to resuscitate them.Heineman pans close to intubated faces, and the audience sees the desperation of patients who try until their last breaths to expel fluid from their lungs.\", \"In the scenes that follow, the film\\u2019s central figure, Dr. Nathalie Doug\\u00e9, is overwhelmed by a new disease that doesn\\u2019t follow familiar patterns. It\\u2019s agonizing to witness the degree of suffering that this movie documents, all the more so because the pandemic is still ongoing.\", \"Heineman doesn\\u2019t include talking heads to contextualize the images that are presented, preferring to allow doctors and nurses to explain the chaos surrounding them. The deliberate lack of an external perspective adds to the crushing atmosphere at the hospital. This is not a comprehensive portrait of diagnostics, treatment plans or even the political circumstances that produced such a deadly first surge. But the film succeeds in presenting an on-the-ground view of what it felt like to be inside a hospital in the spring of 2020. It was harrowing, death was everywhere and there was no end in sight.\"]","href_hash":"be6db53a486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"be6db53a486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}},
