Gen. Sami D. Said, found no violations of law and does not recommend any disciplinary action. The general blamed a series of assumptions, made over the course of eight hours as American officials tracked a white Toyota Corolla through Kabul, for causing what he called \\u201cconfirmation bias,\\u201d leading to the Aug. 29 strike.\", \"\\u201cThat assessment was primarily driven by interpretation,\\u201d the general said on Wednesday during an unclassified briefing on the report to news media at the Pentagon. \\u201cRegrettably, the interpretational assessment was inaccurate.\\u201d\", \"While General Said acknowledged that the military had video footage showing a child at the site two minutes before the launch, he said that he was unsure whether anyone who was not specifically looking for evidence of a child would have picked up on it.\", \"\\u201cTwo independent reviews that I conducted, the physical evidence of a child was apparent at the 2-minute point,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut it is 100 percent not obvious; you have to be looking for it.\\u201d\", \"Planners involved in the strike \\u201chad a genuine belief that there was an imminent threat to U.S. forces,\\u201d the general said. He acknowledged that was \\u201ca mistake\\u201d but added that \\u201cit\\u2019s not negligence.\\u201d\", \"General Said insisted that the strike has to be considered in the context of the moment, with American officials at a heightened state of alert after a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport three days earlier killed about 170 civilians and 13 U.S. troops.\", \"Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III ordered the review of the military\\u2019s initial inquiry into the drone strike to determine, among other issues, who should be held accountable and \\u201cthe degree to which strike authorities, procedures and processes need to be altered in the future.\\u201d\", \"Almost everything senior defense officials asserted in the hours, days and weeks after the drone strike turned out to be false. The explosives the military claimed were loaded in the trunk of a white sedan struck by the drone\\u2019s Hellfire missile were probably water bottles. And a secondary explosion in the courtyard in the densely populated Kabul neighborhood where the attack took place was probably a propane or gas tank, officials said.\", \"The driver of the white sedan that was struck by the American drone, Zemari Ahmadi, was employed by Nutrition & Education International, a California-based aid organization.\", \"Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of Central Command, said in a news conference in September that the strike was carried out \\u201cin the profound belief\\u201d that ISIS was about to launch another attack on Hamid Karzai International Airport.\", \"Since then, the Pentagon offered unspecified condolence payments to the family of the 10 civilians, including seven children, were who killed in the Aug. 29 drone strike.\", \"The Pentagon has also said it was working with the State Department to help surviving members of the family relocate to the United States.\", \"Congress has authorized the Pentagon to pay up to $3 million a year for payments to compensate for property damage, personal injury or deaths related to the actions of U.S. armed forces, as well as for \\u201chero payments\\u201d to the family members of local allied forces, such as Afghan or Iraqi troops fighting Al Qaeda or ISIS.\", \"Condolence payments for deaths caused by the American military have varied widely in recent years. In fiscal 2019, for instance, the Pentagon offered 71 such payments \\u2014 ranging from $131 to $35,000 \\u2014 in Afghanistan and Iraq.\", \"The acknowledgment of the mistaken strike came a week after a New York Times investigation of video evidence challenged assertions by the military that it had struck a vehicle carrying explosives meant for the airport.\"]","href_hash":"9603e6263ce311eca6cd000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9603e6263ce311eca6cd000017025a03"}},
