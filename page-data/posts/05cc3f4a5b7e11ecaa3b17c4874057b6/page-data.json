The cause of his death has not been revealed.\", \"During a career that spanned over half a century, Fern\\u00e1ndez became the rightful heir of popular Mexican folk music and the legendary composers and performers that fill its ranks. His voice was the soundtrack to weddings, funerals, and every memorable occasion in between. Generations celebrated life and love while Vicente Fern\\u00e1ndez   sang in the background.\", \"Fern\\u00e1ndez   started his musical journey singing for tips in the streets of the mariachi capital of the world, the city of Guadalajara in western Mexico.
