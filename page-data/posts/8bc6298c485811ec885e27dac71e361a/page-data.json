Since Mr. Biden took office, the particulars of that Trump-era revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement, called the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, have been in dispute. The accord sought to update Mexico\\u2019s labor laws, encourage more auto production in North America, and open Canadian markets for American dairy farmers.\", \"In recent weeks, the Canadian government has argued that the tax credit offered to American consumers who buy American-made electric vehicles is in breach of the accord. Speaking to reporters in a news conference on Monday, Mr. Trudeau said that the Biden administration\\u2019s buy-American ethos was \\u201ccounterproductive\\u201d to promoting commerce between the two countries.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s an issue that I\\u2019ve already underlined very often with President Biden and it will certainly be part of important conversations that we\\u2019ll have later this week,\\u201d Mr. Trudeau said. \", \"For its part, the Biden administration has accused the Canadian government of practices that favor Canadian dairy farmers and raised concerns that Mexico\\u2019s energy policies give an unfair advantage to state-owned companies. Administration officials said on Wednesday that Mr. Biden planned to reaffirm U.S.M.C.A. provisions in support of labor rights protection, a reference to a dispute settled against Mexico earlier this year.\", \"Officials expect agreements to be reached over vaccine sharing. Leaders in Canada and Mexico will agree to share \\u201cmillions\\u201d of doses with poorer countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, an official said. The three countries will sign onto a pact to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas industries by as much as 75 percent by 2030, and form a working group to address supply chain issues.\", \"The more delicate discussions will come with Mr. L\\u00f3pez Obrador. Mexico, long an underdog in the relationship with its neighbors, has earned considerable leverage in a year that saw a wave of pandemic-fueled migration from Latin America. Mr. Biden has had to rely ever more on Mexico to keep the flow of people from overwhelming the southwestern border, and to house tens of thousands of migrants who might otherwise head north.\", \"For Biden officials, the importance of maintaining strong Mexican enforcement was made clear in September, when thousands of Haitians walked across the border to Texas.\", \"\\u201cThe power balance between the Mexican government and the U.S. government has shifted because of the circumstances,\\u201d said Duncan Wood, the vice president of strategy at the Wilson Center. Mexican officials, Mr. Wood said, \\u201cknow they can hurt the Biden administration, and they know that the Biden administration knows that.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden\\u2019s dependence on Mexico has put the fate of a key piece of his domestic agenda in the hands of Mr. L\\u00f3pez Obrador, who has lashed out at the United States and pursed policies that run counter to American interests.\", \"Mr. L\\u00f3pez Obrador\\u2019s government has sought to jail university professors, gutted funding for civic organizations, attacked journalists by name at national news conferences and championed a constitutional reform that would ensure the dominance of the state-owned electricity giant in Mexico\\u2019s energy market.\", \"\\u201cThey view Mexico as critically important to a number of their high profile goals, the largest of which of course is immigration,\\u201d said Roberta S. Jacobson, who previously served as the ambassador to Mexico and spent four months as Mr. Biden\\u2019s border coordinator. \\u201cBut I think they equally view Mexico as, at best, an extremely complicated partner and at worst an unreliable one on the number of things they care about.\\u201d\", \"While the Mexican leader lavished praise on President Donald J. Trump for not interfering in Mexican affairs, he has taken a more openly confrontational stance toward U.S. policies since Mr. Biden took office.\", \"Just this week, Mr. L\\u00f3pez Obrador skewered the American embargo on Cuba as \\u201cvile\\u201d and attacked the Biden administration for helping to fund Mexican media groups that he described as \\u201copposition publications.\\u201d (The president previously said that American financing for Mexican civil society amounts to \\u201cpromoting a coup mentality.\\u201d)\", \"Vice President Kamala Harris met with Mr. L\\u00f3pez Obrador during her trip to Mexico over the summer and has since been seen as an internal keeper of that relationship. Mr. L\\u00f3pez Obrador will meet with her on Thursday morning before he has a bilateral meeting with Mr. Biden.\", \"Ken Salazar, the ambassador to Mexico, has publicly expressed \\u201cserious concerns\\u201d about the energy reform designed to boost the state-controlled electricity company over private firms. But the administration has stayed mostly quiet on Mr. L\\u00f3pez Obrador\\u2019s provocations, and Mr. Salazar steered clear of offering an assessment of the Mexican president\\u2019s treatment of civil society and the media in a September interview with the Times.\", \"\\u201cFreedom of the press is very valued by President Biden,\\u201d Mr. Salazar said. \\u201cI\\u2019m sure we\\u2019ll have conversations on some of these issues.\\u201d\", \"Mr. L\\u00f3pez Obrador, for his part, has seized the opportunity to assertively pursue his own agenda, particularly on security issues.\", \"For months, the Mexican government delayed granting visas to several agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration who had been waiting for permission to work in the country, according to officials in the two countries.\", \"The delay was partly a response to the arrest of Mexico\\u2019s former defense minister in a Los Angeles airport on charges of drug trafficking at the end of Mr. Trump\\u2019s term last year, the officials said, a move that prompted outrage at the highest levels of the Mexican government.\", \"During discussions over security cooperation after Mr. Biden took office, Mexico asked that the United States allow Mexican security agents into the country to work with local law enforcement officials on efforts to combat the trafficking of American weapons south of the border.\", \"The Biden administration agreed to that proposal, and in the coming weeks, officials expect that the D.E.A. agents will be let into Mexico and the Mexican officials will go to the United States.\", \"Roberto Velasco, the Mexican Foreign Ministry\\u2019s chief officer for North America, said in an interview that the move was part of Mr. L\\u00f3pez Obrador\\u2019s focus on \\u201ca vision of security cooperation that was reciprocal and took into account the priorities of both countries.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8bc6298c485811ec885e27dac71e361a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8bc6298c485811ec885e27dac71e361a"}},
