The new leader campaigned largely by convincing voters that he would be like his predecessor.\", \"Scholz and his coalition partners from the progressive Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats yesterday announced a governing deal that they had been negotiating in secrecy since the Sept. 26 election.\", \"Scholz is expected to be sworn in next month. He will immediately face a pressing roster of crises, including a coronavirus pandemic that is spiraling quickly with a spike in cases and border conflicts in Belarus and Ukraine.\", \"Changes ahead: Germany\\u2019s new government wants to legalize marijuana, a plan that Merkel\\u2019s party blocked for years.\", \"At least 27 people drowned off the coast of France yesterday after an inflatable boat carrying migrants trying to reach Britain capsized in the English Channel. The dead included five women and a girl, said G\\u00e9rald Darmanin, France\\u2019s interior minister. Two people were rescued and hospitalized with severe hypothermia.\", \"The local maritime authorities said they quickly sent out rescue ships and helicopters after a fishing vessel alerted them that several people were lost off the coast of Calais in France. The drownings came a few days after the French and British authorities reached an agreement to do more to stem the number of people taking to the sea.\", \"Attempts to reach Britain by boat have increased as the authorities have cracked down on the smuggling of migrants inside trucks crossing the Channel Tunnel. Many migrants perceive Britain as an ideal destination because English is spoken, they may know people there and the job market is more loosely regulated for undocumented workers.\", \"Responses: \\u201cFrance won\\u2019t let the Channel become a graveyard,\\u201d Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said. He called for an immediate tightening of border controls. Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, said t he was \\u201cshocked and appalled and deeply saddened.\\u201d\", \"Related: In Poland, the Law and Justice party\\u2019s tough stance on migrants seeking to enter the E.U. from Belarus has lifted its popularity, which had taken blows because of Covid and rising inflation.\", \"As England settles into a disquieting new normal of more than 40,000 new cases of Covid-19 a day and around a thousand fatalities each week, Neil Ferguson, a top government scientific adviser, has revived the debate over herd immunity, claiming that the country is close to the threshold at which most of the population is protected against the coronavirus.\", \"The high caseloads may leave the country well placed to resist the fresh wave of infections sweeping across continental Europe, he said, in part because so many Britons had been infected since the lockdown was lifted in July, giving the population as a whole greater immunity.\", \"Ferguson's comments are likely to raise new questions about Britain\\u2019s decision to tolerate a widely circulating virus and a steady death toll as the price of a return to economic normalcy. Other public health experts are skeptical of the herd immunity theory, which, they say, does not consider factors like new variants or waning protection from vaccines.\", \"Analysis: \\u201cI don\\u2019t think modelers have enough data to assess whether we\\u2019ve reached the mythical herd immunity stage,\\u201d said Devi Sridhar, head of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh. \\u201cWith Covid, it will either be when everyone has had Covid and survived, died of it or been vaccinated against it.\\u201d\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"For the past 50 years, Francisco Luis Ram\\u00edrez has healed Mexico City\\u2019s ailing accordions.

Now the genre-bending novel, translated into English, is available in the U.S., Roger Cohen reports for The Times.\", \"The story, in a nutshell: A flight from Paris to New York lands on March 10, 2021, after passing through a terrifying storm.
