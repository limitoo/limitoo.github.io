In an analysis of almost 450 military special victims cases filed between 2018 to 2020, the Department of Defense's inspector general found that 64% did not have properly trained prosecutors assigned to them.\", \"This is a developing story and will be updated.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"12c76e1e7efa11ec805d7f3164fefe3e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"12c76e1e7efa11ec805d7f3164fefe3e"}},
