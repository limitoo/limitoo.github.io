Right now I'm a research scientist, but I'm stuck at home and therefore I can potentially help someone, and obviously I support vaccination and also just learning science. It's really fun teaching as well.\\\"\", \"Even Kaipara deputy mayor Anna Curnow offered to teach an online class on local government and civics.\", \"\\\"This is a time of great stress for schools and this is a way for people to offer their support. I really liked that sense of 'we understand the stress and we can bring what we can, use it if it helps' and for me that just happens to be local government.\\\"\", \"So far Taylor Davies-Colley has had three teachers contact him to arrange Zoom classes.\", \"\\\"I think one of the things that blew me away the most is just how many other people are offering up their time.
