People are terrified of a lot of new things,\\\" Pogue said, adding that through human history we have survived by being wary of the unknown. \\\"You can't see the virus. You can't see the software in a self-driving car, you can't see radio waves for 5G. So those two things \\u2014 recent technologies that are invisible \\u2014 are the ones that people are going to reject, are going to be suspicious of.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"My job is to make these things not unfamiliar,\\\" Pogue added.\\u00a0\", \"In early 2021, Pogue published a book,\\u00a0How to Prepare for Climate Change,\\u00a0that offers advice on how humans can prepare for changing climates around the world.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Unfortunately, the climate crisis did not take a year off during the pandemic. [In] 2020, we had the hottest temperature ever recorded on the planet \\u2014 one hundred and thirty-one degrees. We had the greatest number of hurricanes, so many that they ran out of the alphabetical male and female names \\u2014 had to start using Greek letters. We had record wildfires,\\\" Pogue said. \\\"So, I can't predict when a climate crisis will hit you by name, but I know that you will be stuck with something. 25 million Americans a year get face-to-face with some kind of weather disaster. And so, if you know it's coming, why wouldn't you want to prepare for it?\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Pogue also had a take on Facebook's recent corporate rebrand to \\\"Meta.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The whole thing kind of cracks me up. I mean, Facebook is in dire public relations trouble right now, and it's just the perfect misdirection. 'Look over here! We've got a new name!'\\\" Pogue said. \\\"So they wanted to make their name \\\"Meta\\\" in the same way that Google made their name Alphabet... The Metaverse is just this goofy name for augmented reality.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Listen to Pogue's podcast \\\"Unsung Science\\\"\\u00a0here\\u00a0or listen wherever you get your podcasts.\\u00a0\", \"Executive producer: Arden Farhi\", \"Producers: Jamie Benson, Jacob Rosen, Sara Cook and Eleanor Watson\", \"CBSN Production: Eric Soussanin\\u00a0Show email:\\u00a0TakeoutPodcast@cbsnews.comTwitter:\\u00a0@TakeoutPodcastInstagram:\\u00a0@TakeoutPodcastFacebook:\\u00a0Facebook.com/TakeoutPodcast\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"9a1f4ac43e1f11ec934f3b36334620fa"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9a1f4ac43e1f11ec934f3b36334620fa"}},
