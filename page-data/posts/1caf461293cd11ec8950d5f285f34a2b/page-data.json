TCC is restoring fiber cable internet services,\\\" the company said in a message to customers.\", \" The January 15 eruption was so powerful it was heard as far away as Alaska and caused a tsunami that flooded coastlines around the Pacific.\", \"It covered Tonga with ash and mangled a long stretch of the undersea cable that proved more difficult than expected to fix.\", \" Immediately after the disaster, contact with Tonga was only possible via a handful of satellite links.
