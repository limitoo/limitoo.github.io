I canceled plans and stayed home. When I did venture out, I used crutches and a knee brace. Today, my knee isn\\u2019t perfect, but it doesn\\u2019t hold me back. I\\u2019ve just accepted that I have to do things a little differently.\", \"We regularly take this holistic approach to our personal health. During the crisis phase of an injury or an illness, we do whatever is needed to take care of our bodies. But we never lose sight of the goal: to recover and enjoy life again.\", \"By now, you may have figured out that the point of this story isn\\u2019t my knee injury.\", \"In Friday\\u2019s edition of The Morning, David Leonhardt wrote about how we might navigate this point in the pandemic, where the coronavirus remains in our lives but vaccinated people in many parts of the country are not in crisis. Today, I\\u2019m going to explore how those ideas can help you plan for Thanksgiving and holiday gatherings.\", \"Many of us are now in the recovery phase of this pandemic. During the early crisis, we needed to stay home to stay safe. But now that vaccines are available, it\\u2019s time to think holistically \\u2014 focusing on the mental, emotional and social aspects of our health, too.\", \"\\u201cHolidays are so important; they have meaning,\\u201d Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told me. \\u201cPeople have been isolated and fearful for almost two years.\\u201d\", \"Of course, a holistic approach works only if you\\u2019ve been vaccinated and continue to take a few reasonable precautions. For unvaccinated adults, the pandemic remains a daily threat, and a personal choice to stay unvaccinated will continue to put you and those around you at risk.\", \"The rules are different if you\\u2019re celebrating what I like to call \\u201cVax-giving,\\u201d a Thanksgiving gathering where everyone who is eligible is fully vaccinated and boosted. Even children ages 5 to 11 can have at least one shot, and some level of protection, by then. Children who are 4 and younger aren\\u2019t eligible for shots yet, but they\\u2019re still largely protected if they\\u2019re surrounded by vaccinated people.\", \"I spoke with Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, about how parents with children too young to get the vaccines should navigate the holidays. Mina is one of those parents, and will be traveling with his infant daughter to a fully vaccinated, four-generation Thanksgiving celebration. Before the gathering, everyone but the infant will take a rapid test. He said his main concern was protecting his 95-year-old grandfather.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s still a lot of virus in the community, but the truth of the matter is, little kids are not exceedingly susceptible to disease with this virus,\\u201d Mina said. \\u201cI do think that by everyone testing the morning of Thanksgiving or even two hours before dinner, it\\u2019s going to massively decrease any risk and make everyone feel more comfortable to be around each other without masks.\\u201d\", \"For many people, coping with the anxiety of getting out and about may be the hardest part of adjusting to this new phase of pandemic life.\", \"Linsey Marr, an aerosol scientist from Virginia Tech whom many of us have come to rely on for sage advice during the pandemic, is planning a multigenerational gathering for Christmas and New Year that will include air travel. But she said that she and her family had only recently dined indoors for the first time.\", \"\\u201cIt was a restaurant in a university town where the vaccination rate is high,\\u201d Marr said. \\u201cI asked if the staff had all been vaccinated. I calculated \\u2014 almost everyone here, if not everyone, is probably vaccinated; at some point we want to eat out. Let\\u2019s go for it.\\u201d\", \"Marr said it took a mental adjustment to spend time indoors and unmasked with strangers. \\u201cIt was a little nerve-racking,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe kept our masks on until the food came. Baby steps.\\u201d\", \"Going forward, part of living with Covid will mean doing these sorts of on-the-spot calculations to assess risk. It sounds difficult, but it\\u2019s the kind of mental calculus that comes naturally with more familiar dangers.\", \"Think about winter driving. We know that thousands of people are injured or killed each year on icy roads, but we don\\u2019t stay home all winter. We check the forecast and whether the roads have been plowed. We make sure our cars and tires are in good condition, and then we buckle our seatbelts and hit the road to shop for groceries, go to school or see family for the holidays.\", \"Assessing risk for Covid will be similar and, eventually, just as natural.\", \"It starts with staying aware of local Covid conditions, like hospitalizations and vaccination rates, and avoiding crowds and high-risk gatherings where we don\\u2019t know the vaccination status of others. We\\u2019ll wear masks when needed and use rapid home tests to keep gatherings Covid-free. And anyone who is sneezing or coughing should always stay home.\", \"Jha says that he remains cautious about Covid when he\\u2019s not sure of the vaccination status of those around him, and that he\\u2019s willing to skip things \\u201con the margins.\\u201d He recently met a friend at a restaurant, and they decided to go somewhere else because it was packed. But he\\u2019s planning a Thanksgiving celebration that includes grandparents and children. Everyone who is eligible will be fully vaccinated and have a booster shot.\", \"\\u201cCan we do it with 100 percent safety? I don\\u2019t know that we could do it with 100 percent safety in 2019,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI feel like we now know how to manage the risks, and we can do things in a way to keep everyone safe. There\\u2019s no reason to keep missing these really important, meaningful times together.\\u201d\", \"Inflation and great-power rivalry give Republicans a chance to campaign like it\\u2019s the 1980s, says Ross Douthat.\", \"A letter from Pope Francis gives Michael O\\u2019Loughlin hope that dialogue is possible between L.G.B.T. Catholics and church leaders.\", \"Bret Stephens discusses his breakthrough Covid case and Gail Collins talks about the Kyle Rittenhouse trial.\", \"Mr. Spears: The man marrying one of the world\\u2019s biggest pop stars wants his own fame.\", \"Quiz time: The average score on our latest news quiz was 9.3.

She died at 46.\", \"The M+ Museum in Hong Kong, meant to be Asia\\u2019s premier art institution, recently opened its doors after a long and difficult development period. But as Vivian Wang writes in The Times, its greatest challenge is just beginning: the threat of censorship.\", \"The original vision for M+ was tied to Hong Kong\\u2019s relative autonomy. \\u201cWe have the freedom of speech here,\\u201d Lars Nittve, the first executive director, said in 2011. \\u201cWe can show things that can\\u2019t be shown in mainland China.\\u201d Last year, though, Beijing imposed a national security law that allows the government to prosecute subversive speech in Hong Kong. Officials say they will inspect every M+ exhibit.\", \"The museum must walk a delicate line. This year, after a pro-Beijing lawmaker singled out a photograph by the dissident artist Ai Weiwei \\u2014 one with his middle finger raised before Tiananmen Square \\u2014 the museum removed the piece from its website. But two more of Ai\\u2019s works remain, as does a painting inspired by a photograph from the Tiananmen massacre.\", \"Wong Ka Ying, a local artist, was optimistic about the museum\\u2019s efforts. \\u201cIt\\u2019s safe, but it also touched on humanity and social issues,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019m still looking forward to what they can do under so many constraints.\\u201d\", \"This lemony chicken soup is lighter than a traditional stew.\", \"Turkey\\u2019s fine, but sides are the low-key stars of the table.
