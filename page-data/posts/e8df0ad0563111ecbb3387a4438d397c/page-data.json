Mark Pestrella, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, said in an interview on Sunday that the warehouse contained \\u201clarge vats of ethanol\\u201d and \\u201ceverything from hand wipes to bottles of hand sanitizer.\\u201d\", \"The chemicals then passed into the sewage system, the air quality district said, and ultimately drained into the Dominguez Channel, a flood-control waterway that runs more than 15 miles from Los Angeles International Airport to Los Angeles Harbor. This led to the decay of organic materials in the channel, resulting in the emission of hydrogen sulfide gas that far exceeded the state\\u2019s nuisance standard, the agency said.\", \"The resulting \\u201cputrid, sulfur-like odor,\\u201d as the Public Works Department described it in a letter to the county\\u2019s board of supervisors, generated thousands of complaints. In the span of less than a week, the authorities fielded more than 4,000 complaints from residents of Carson and surrounding communities, the air quality district said, noting that the smell of hydrogen sulfide can trigger headaches and nausea.\", \"One resident, a high school football coach, told The Los Angeles Times that the smell was \\u201clike a dirty gym sock\\u201d or \\u201can unclean locker room.\\u201d Another compared it to the stench of rotting fish and dirty diapers.\", \"A class-action lawsuit filed in mid-October accuses three companies that were doing business at the warehouse at the time of the fire of negligence, which led to the noxious gas exposure.\", \"In the days after the fire, the companies failed to properly discard large quantities of \\u201csoggy, charred debris\\u201d that were piled up in and around the warehouse, \\u201cdespite the dangers and high likelihood that the debris would make its way into nearby storm drains,\\u201d according to the complaint.\", \"For a week after the blaze, residents of communities along the waterway had no information about the source of the odor, the lawsuit says. Local officials speculated about the cause of the fire. In early October, Mayor Lula Davis-Holmes of Carson said that the gas was from a \\u201cleaking pipeline.\\u201d\", \"Monique Alvarez, 40, a plaintiff in the lawsuit who lives a \\u201c30-second jog\\u201d from the channel, said in an interview on Sunday that \\u201cno one was really helping\\u201d or \\u201cproviding tangible resources.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t really have answers at the time,\\u201d Ms. Alvarez said, adding that her three children broke out in welts and woke up struggling to breathe.\", \"\\u201cOne day living in this environment felt like an eternity,\\u201d she said.\", \"A week after the fire, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health declared that it had found \\u201cvery low levels of hydrogen sulfide\\u201d in the air. Two days later, the department said the odors were \\u201csufficiently pervasive\\u201d and urged residents to get air filters, shut their windows and doors, and keep their pets indoors.\", \"At one point, members of about 3,400 households were staying in hotel rooms paid for by Los Angeles County, said Kerjon Lee, a spokesman for the Department of Public Works, adding that the county also provided 40,000 air purifiers.\", \"These efforts and the emergency work to mitigate the odor from the channel had cost the county $54 million as of last week, Mr. Lee said.\", \"The warehouse is owned by Liberty Properties Limited Partnership and its parent company, Prologis Inc., according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Two other companies, Virgin Scent and Day to Day Imports, were storing wellness and beauty products there at the time of the fire, the air quality district said.\", \"The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Prologis told The Los Angeles Times that the company was working with the Los Angeles County Fire Department to clean up the debris from the fire and to protect the property from storm water runoff.\", \"The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors did not respond to a request for comment.\", \"Mr. Pestrella, the county Public Works Department director, said that the department was seeking an emergency designation from the state and that Los Angeles County was \\u201cpreparing potential litigation\\u201d against the companies.\", \"He added that the odor had lifted, and that while water conditions were much improved, it could take up to two years for the channel to fully recover.\", \"Ms. Alvarez said that after a month in a hotel room, she and her family returned to their home just after Thanksgiving. Their neighborhood no longer smells, she said, but her children still occasionally experience symptoms, including bloody noses.\", \"\\u201cMy home does not feel safe anymore,\\u201d she said. \\u201cPeople in our area are still getting sick. The symptoms are still here and our bodies are still saying something is wrong.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e8df0ad0563111ecbb3387a4438d397c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e8df0ad0563111ecbb3387a4438d397c"}},
