Do they think we're dumb?\\\" asked Greene, (played by Cecily Strong) to which Boebert (Chloe Fineman) replied, \\\"Please, would they give a dumb person a gun? Yes.\\\"\", \"\\\"First, they said the shutdowns were until they found a vaccine,\\\" Greene continued. \\\"Then they found a vaccine and said it worked. Then they said everyone should get it. Then people got it and it saved their lives. If that's not communism, then honey, I might not know what communism is.\\\"\", \"\\\"So Merry Christmas, and remember,\\\" Boebert added, \\\"Guns don't kill people\\u2014people people people.\\\"\", \"On Sunday morning, Boebert responded by issuing an attack against the long-running NBC comedy show on Twitter.\", \"\\\"Just saw the poorly-acted SNL skit from last night. Seeing the poor trigger discipline from the no-name actress who played me makes me think Alec Baldwin did the gun safety training over there. BTW, when are they moving SNL over to CNN to die out of irrelevance?,\\\" Boebert wrote.\", \"Saturday's latest episode also poked fun at Dr. Anthony Fauci (Kate McKinnon), former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (Pete Davidson), and his brother, the recently fired CNN host Chris Cuomo (Andrew Dismukes). The episode starred musician Billie Eilish as both the host and musical guest.\", \"Boebert's attack on the show echoed similar remarks made by Donald Trump, who railed against SNL on multiple occasions throughout his presidency. At one point, Trump even called for \\\"retribution\\\" against the show and asked the federal government to \\\"look into\\\" its comedic criticism.\", \"\\\"It's truly incredible that shows like Saturday Night Live, not funny/no talent, can spend all of their time knocking the same person (me), over & over, without so much of a mention of \\\"the other side.\\\" Like an advertisement without consequences. Same with Late Night Shows,\\\" Trump tweeted in 2019.\", \"\\\"Should Federal Election Commission and/or FCC look into this? There must be Collusion with the Democrats and, of course, Russia! Such one sided media coverage, most of it Fake News. Hard to believe I won and am winning. Approval Rating 52%, 93% with Republicans. Sorry! #MAGA,\\\" he added.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949932/lauren-boebert-marjorie-taylor-greene-snl.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Representative Lauren Boebert attacked SNL on Sunday after the comedy show poked fun of her and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene.
