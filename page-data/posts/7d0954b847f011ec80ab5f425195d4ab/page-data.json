W.H.O. officials and other experts have criticized the U.S. for rolling out boosters before many people in lower-income countries have gotten their first doses.\", \"It comes as the administration also plans to spend $5 billion on Pfizer\\u2019s new Covid pill and billions more on rapid over-the-counter tests, to build a multifaceted treatment framework.\", \"Quotable: \\u201cThe goal, in the case of a future pandemic, a future virus, is to have vaccine capability within six to nine months of identification of that pandemic pathogen, and to have enough vaccines for all Americans,\\u201d said Dr. David Kessler, who oversees vaccine distribution for the administration.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"President Biden asked the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. agency that oversees consumer protection, to look into whether \\u201cillegal conduct\\u201d by large oil and gas companies is pushing up gasoline prices for American consumers.\", \"The president noted in a letter to the F.T.C. that prices have risen even as the costs of refined fuel have fallen and industry profits have gone up. The two largest producers, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, have doubled their net income since 2019, he wrote, while announcing billions of dollars in plans to issue dividends and buy back stock.\", \"The move is unlikely to spur immediate action or materially affect gas prices anytime soon.\", \"Context: Soaring gas prices around the world have been pushed by an OPEC choke on production and renewed driving after a pandemic hiatus, and have fueled inflation. In Britain, energy prices sent inflation in October to its highest level in nearly a decade.\", \"Pandemic stocks: Shares of companies that had an early pandemic boom \\u2014 like Peloton and Zoom \\u2014 have dropped in recent months, as people try to get back to their normal activities.\", \"Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of Ethiopians belonging to the Tigrayan ethnic group have been rounded up and detained in recent weeks.\", \"Tigrayans had dominated the Ethiopian government and army for decades until Abiy Ahmed, Ethopia\\u2019s prime minister, took power in 2018 and sidelined their leaders. For the past year, Abiy has been waging a grisly war against Tigrayan rebels in the country\\u2019s northernmost region.\", \"But since the war began, the Tigrayans have routed the Ethiopian military in Tigray and swept south. They recently captured two strategic towns and threatened to advance toward the capital.\", \"The resulting government roundups have swept up anyone of Tigrayan descent, many of whom had no ties to the rebels or even any affinity for them.\", \"Blinken\\u2019s trip: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kenya on Wednesday as the Biden administration focuses on the chaos in the Horn of Africa, plagued by spreading war and famine in Ethiopia and a recent military coup in Sudan that threatens to derail its transition to democracy.\", \"Instability in Sudan: Sudanese forces fired into crowds of demonstrators in Khartoum on Wednesday, killing 10 people and wounding many others, medics report.\", \"On social media, Refaat Alareer, a professor at the Islamic University of Gaza, rages against Israel. But in the lecture hall, he studiously analyzes the work of some of the country\\u2019s leading poets \\u2014 and surprises some of his students.\", \"\\u201cMaybe this changed something in my mind about their experience,\\u201d one Palestinian student said of studying Israeli poetry. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like we share things. We relate.\\u201d\", \"Pageants are no longer \\u201cthe degrading Mindless-Boob-Girlie Symbol\\u201d that the New York Radical Women protest group described in 1968. The swimsuits and sashes are still there, but in recent years, beauty queens have used contests to raise awareness of social issues, as Miss Universe Myanmar, Ma Thuzar Wint Lwin, did this year about her country\\u2019s junta.\", \"But few have been asked to make the decision South Africa\\u2019s newest beauty queen must make: Live out her childhood dream or show global solidarity.\", \"Activists and the South African government have called on Lalela Mswane to boycott the Miss Universe pageant in Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians, with whom the governing African National Congress has longstanding and close relationships.\", \"\\u201cWe would be very disingenuous and really quite frankly pathetic to associate ourselves with such inhumanity,\\u201d the spokeswoman for the Sport, Arts and Culture Ministry said.\", \"The ministry is threatening to \\u201cdisassociate\\u201d itself from the pageant, but it\\u2019s unclear what this will mean \\u2014 whether Mswane will be allowed to wave the South African flag or identify herself as Miss South Africa if she competes.\", \"Miss Malaysia and Miss Indonesia have said they will not take part.
