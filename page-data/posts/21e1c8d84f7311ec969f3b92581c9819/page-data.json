Instead, I'd rather focus on gift ideas that will make the other person feel comfortable and special and/or items that you can use together. Below are helpful gift ideas that individuals can use and a few that promote spending time with each other.\", \"It can be hard to figure out what women might want when it comes to things to wear, so I enlisted the help of my wife for some of those gift ideas. Plenty of the items below are gender-neutral, too.\", \"But, in an attempt to find things that can directly benefit a relationship, I also found perfect things for couples to use together, such as cooking and eating or playing a sport.
