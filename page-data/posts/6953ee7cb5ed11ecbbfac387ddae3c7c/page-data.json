If you don't have to sell and you can ride out whatever the next one to two years brings... because what we always get off the back of a slow or declining market is another boom.\\\"\", \"However, he said while recent buyers were stress-tested to make home loan repayments on higher interest rates there was no doubt the next few years would be tough for some.\", \"\\\"There's genuinely going to be people that bought and paid, certainly in the last 12 months, at 2.5 percent interest and now they're going to be going at 5 percent... so if you've borrowed $1 million your interest cost was $25,000 a year, it's now going to be $50,000. That's genuinely going to hurt some people.\", \"\\\"Young people I'm not so worried about because they're at the beginning of their work life and they genuinely tend to have income increases on a regular basis. It's probably anybody that's highly geared and they're on a fixed income, and the prospects of of income going up are limited, they will be the ones that will be struggling.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/137517/eight_col_220112_Housing-Chch_02.jpg?1643695471\\\" alt=\\\"Christchurch based housing\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPeople on fixed incomes may struggle to service mortgages with higher interest rates, a mortgage broker says.  \\nPhoto: RNZ / Nate McKinnon\\n</div>\", \"Professional renovator and property developer Tom Faye said those who recently purchased properties with the intention of selling quickly might find themselves refinancing or selling for less.\", \"\\\"That's the one that's going to catch people out.
