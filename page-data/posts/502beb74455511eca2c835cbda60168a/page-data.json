They won 90 games, the team\\u2019s highest total since 2003. Their hopes of reaching the postseason for the first time since 2001 \\u2014 the longest playoff drought among teams from the four major North American men\\u2019s professional sports leagues \\u2014 were alive until the final day of the regular season.\", \"So the mission for Jerry Dipoto, Seattle\\u2019s president of baseball operations, this off-season is clear: continue shaping the young team into a contender \\u2014 with loosened purse strings from Mariners owners. For an aggressive and restless executive like Dipoto, though, this winter is likely to offer a unique challenge.\", \"At midnight on Dec. 1, the foundation of the sport \\u2014 the collective bargaining agreement between the owners of the 30 Major League Baseball clubs and their players \\u2014 expires. Both sides have publicly expressed some tepid optimism that a new deal will be reached by then. But given the many negotiating hurdles and fraught labor relations between M.L.B. and the players\\u2019 union, this hot stove season may be chillier and slower burning.\", \"Baseball has not had a work stoppage since the strike that prematurely ended the 1994 season, canceled that year\\u2019s World Series and bled into the next season. But if no agreement is reached in a few weeks, M.L.B.\\u2019s owners could enact a lockout to freeze transactions. If that were to happen, team executives wouldn\\u2019t be allowed to talk to players, make major-league signings or swing trades.\", \"\\u201cI can\\u2019t let those things affect me,\\u201d Dipoto said. \\u201cWe are focused on how we make our team better and playing within the same parameters that we\\u2019ve always played in. All I can focus on is putting the team together. For us, that started a while ago. We\\u2019re engaged with free agents and we\\u2019re engaged in trade discussions. We\\u2019ll push and this is how we operate. We generally operate sooner rather than later. We tend to move pretty quickly and that part of our personality isn\\u2019t likely to change.\\u201d\", \"Dipoto\\u2019s comments were mirrored by many of his counterparts at M.L.B.\\u2019s annual general managers meetings this week at a Southern California hotel. In many ways, it had the trappings of a normal start to the off-season despite the elephant in the room (or lobby). Team executives gathered at the lavish Omni La Costa Resort and Spa for meetings with each other, M.L.B. officials and agents. Discussions about trades and free-agent signings were held in the courtyards, hotel suites and at the bar.\", \"Even Steven Matz \\u2014 the free agent pitcher who had a resurgent season with the Toronto Blue Jays this year following an up-and-down tenure with the Mets \\u2014 was spotted at the hotel.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re talking to a man who has been up until 3 o\\u2019clock in the morning every night I\\u2019ve been here,\\u201d said agent Scott Boras when asked about the possibility of a slower, interrupted off-season ahead. He doesn\\u2019t represent Matz but he has other top free-agent clients like pitcher Max Scherzer and infielders Corey Seager and Marcus Semien.\", \"Boras continued, \\u201cI would say that this marketplace is very aggressive because there are really good players out there.\\u201d\", \"Not a lot, though, typically happens this early in the off-season. Atlanta won the World Series on Nov. 2. In the weeks that follow, free-agent players are often fielding initial overtures from teams, which are conversely figuring out how much players are seeking in their contracts and future homes. Trade talks are happening simultaneously.\", \"\\u201cThis is the feel-out period of time,\\u201d Derek Falvey, the chief baseball officer of the Minnesota Twins, said of this stage of the off-season. \\u201cFor us, we\\u2019re talking with agents, we\\u2019re talking with other clubs, we\\u2019re talking about trades. We\\u2019ve had some conversations with players already and even made offers at different junctures. So for us, it doesn\\u2019t change.\\u201d\", \"Added John Mozeliak, the St. Louis Cardinals\\u2019 president of baseball operations: \\u201cThese meetings so far have gone like the last 20 I\\u2019ve attended.\\u201d\", \"The biggest signing so far: The Los Angeles Dodgers inked the left-handed pitcher Andrew Heaney to a one-year, $8.5 million contract. But without much clarity on the future economic structure of the sport \\u2014 the union has proposed, for example, ways for younger players to get paid more and sooner in their careers \\u2014 mapping out budgets and building rosters might be more challenging. Pacts bigger and longer than Heaney\\u2019s might not be as common before a new labor deal is struck, which leaves players like Carlos Correa, the star shortstop of the Houston Astros, in limbo as he waits to sign what could be baseball\\u2019s next $300 million contract.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s no different than \\u201915, \\u201916,\\u201d said Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers president of baseball operations, referring to the current collective bargaining agreement that was completed ahead of the previous pact\\u2019s Dec. 1, 2016 expiration.\", \"\\u201cYeah, there are things that could change. And there are decisions we made before and decisions we made after they reached an agreement. You, at least, directionally have a sense of different things. You may not have all the details. But for the most part, it shouldn\\u2019t materially change any one decision. It may change a collection of decisions.\\u201d\", \"According to the payroll tracking site Cots Baseball Contracts, the Dodgers ($262 million) were believed to be the only team to exceed the current luxury tax threshold of $210 million in 2021. Five other teams \\u2014 including the Yankees ($208 million), Houston Astros ($207 million) or San Diego Padres ($206 million) \\u2014 were within $10 million of that line.\", \"In its August proposal to players, M.L.B. offered a hard salary floor of $100 million \\u2014 which would be a first for the sport and is something the union has long opposed \\u2014 in addition to a lower luxury tax threshold of $180 million with steeper rates for going over. (Draft-pick penalties would begin at $210 million.) So how do team executives plan for what could be moving goal posts?\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve had really no discussion with Hal on that because I don\\u2019t know what that is,\\u201d said Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman in reference to Hal Steinbrenner, the team\\u2019s managing general partner.\", \"\\u201cNor would he or anybody else because they\\u2019re openly negotiating on that aspect,\\u201d Cashman continued. \\u201cSo at the end of it all, we\\u2019ll operate under the current system knowing we have some latitude. And hopefully, obviously, regardless of what happens, the intent is to find a better team to enter spring training with than the one we ended the season with.\\u201d\", \"Cashman said he didn\\u2019t have a set budget from Steinbrenner but he had some direction on where payroll would go (up) given the Yankees\\u2019 needs (shortstop chief among them) and the money already committed to current players. As a result, the team will be connected to high-profile free agents like Correa and Seager.\", \"Sandy Alderson, the Mets\\u2019 president, said his team\\u2019s working assumption was that there will be no work stoppage starting on Dec. 2. Spring training is to begin in February, with the 2022 regular season scheduled to start on March 31. \\u201cWe\\u2019re obviously mindful that things may come to a halt in early December or some time thereafter, but right now we\\u2019re building for the season and for the future,\\u201d he said.\", \"Perhaps, though, this normally slow start to the off-season could be a prime opening for a team to pounce given the potential pause ahead. Alderson said the Mets would be \\u201copportunistic\\u201d but \\u201cwe\\u2019ll see how players feel about the next three or four weeks, and whether there\\u2019s a mutual interest in doing something before Dec. 2.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"502beb74455511eca2c835cbda60168a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"502beb74455511eca2c835cbda60168a"}},
