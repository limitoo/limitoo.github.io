The result: a raft of cancellations unlike any in history.\", \"On Wednesday, \\u201cTina,\\u201d a jukebox musical about Tina Turner, canceled both of its performances, and \\u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\\u201d a stage sequel to the novels, canceled its matinee. A new musical adaptation of \\u201cMrs. Doubtfire\\u201d had already canceled four performances between Sunday and Wednesday, while Lin-Manuel Miranda\\u2019s improv troupe, \\u201cFreestyle Love Supreme,\\u201d canceled three, and \\u201cAin\\u2019t Too Proud,\\u201d the Temptations jukebox musical, canceled one. At an Off Broadway theater down the street, a strong-selling revival of \\u201cLittle Shop of Horrors\\u201d scrapped four weekend shows.\", \"All cited Covid.\", \"In each case, at least one member of the show\\u2019s cast or crew tested positive for the coronavirus, and, either because of a lack of enough people to replace those who test positive or a concern about contagion, performances had to be canceled. They were not the first, and almost certainly won\\u2019t be the last, as the persistent pandemic continues to pose a challenge to an industry struggling to get back on its feet after a lengthy and damaging shutdown kept theaters dark for more than a year.\", \"Broadway has taken many precautions \\u2014 there is an industrywide vaccine mandate for audiences and workers, and patrons must wear masks \\u2014 but nobody lives in a bubble, and frequent testing (daily at some shows) is turning up a steady stream of breakthrough infections. And as the Omicron variant causes caseloads to rise, some performing arts institutions are starting to go further: The Metropolitan Opera said Wednesday that, starting Jan. 17, it would require booster shots for both employees and audience members.\", \"In many cases, those testing positive have been asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, but they are not allowed to return until they are deemed no longer contagious.\", \"\\u201cWe have to accept that there is going to be some percentage of performances lost to this,\\u201d said Hunter Arnold, a producer whose shows this season included a new comedy, \\u201cChicken & Biscuits,\\u201d that had to close for 10 days last month because of coronavirus cases in its company.\", \"The cancellations are not only disruptive to consumers \\u2014 many of them have been announced just minutes before showtime \\u2014 but are also costly to producers, many of whom already struggle to achieve profitability in an industry where far more shows fail than succeed. For a show grossing $1 million a week, each missed performance would mean a loss of about $125,000; cancellations on weekends are costlier, because that\\u2019s when many shows are most full, and cancellations at this time of year are especially painful, because Broadway traditionally sees an attendance spike during the holiday season.\", \"At \\u201cMrs. Doubtfire,\\u201d for example, the Covid cancellations ate up all of last week\\u2019s anticipated profits \\u2014 about $300,000 \\u2014 according to Kevin McCollum, the show\\u2019s lead producer. But he said he is optimistic that many of those whose tickets were canceled will rebook for a later performance.\", \"\\u201cWhat\\u2019s happening is a challenge for all of us in the industry, because we\\u2019re in the business of gathering,\\u201d Mr. McCollum said. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t pretend no one has Covid when they have Covid. I\\u2019m hoping this will be put into the level of the common cold in the future, but until then, we have to respect it fully.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cChicken & Biscuits,\\u201d which was already struggling at the box office when infections hit its company, cited the costs of canceled shows in deciding to close down the production for good.\", \"The industry\\u2019s leaders say cancellations show their commitment to safety, but are nonetheless worrisome.\", \"\\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on was contemplated \\u2014 we hoped that it wouldn\\u2019t happen in the numbers that it\\u2019s happening, but it was contemplated, because we know there\\u2019s an ongoing pandemic,\\u201d said Mary McColl, the executive director of Actors\\u2019 Equity, a labor union representing performers and stage managers. \\u201cThe fact that cases are being caught, and performances are being paused, shows that both sides are paying attention \\u2014 the producers and the unions \\u2014 and that\\u2019s what all of the safety protocols are there for. And my hope is that makes audiences feel more secure.\\u201d\", \"The Broadway League, a trade organization representing producers and theater owners, agreed that the cancellations are not a surprise, but also noted that most shows are continuing to run. As of Sunday, there had been 2,351 Broadway performances, seen by 2.3 million people, since plays and musicals returned to Broadway in late summer.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s no question that this current rash of breakthrough cases is concerning, but the industry has not shut down,\\u201d said Charlotte St. Martin, the League\\u2019s president. \\u201cI\\u2019m knocking on wood so much I have bruised knuckles, but so far we\\u2019re still open, and a two- or three-day shutdown, now and then, I think is to be expected.\\u201d\", \"Fans have been upset, frustrated, rattled, but also understanding.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not insane \\u2014 of course they\\u2019re going to cancel a show if someone has Covid,\\u201d said Karleigh Kebartas, a 21-year-old psychology student at Pace University, who had a ticket to the canceled Saturday matinee of \\u201cLittle Shop,\\u201d \\u201cbut it\\u2019s disappointing.\\u201d Ms. Kebartas was already at the theater when the show was canceled \\u2014 in fact, much of the audience was held in the lobby until several minutes after the scheduled start time, when an announcement was made with no explanation of the reason. But Ms. Kebartas got lucky \\u2014 on Tuesday, she was able to buy another ticket to that night\\u2019s performance, enabling her to catch the show\\u2019s star, Jeremy Jordan, before heading home to Massachusetts for the holidays.\", \"The closings began almost as soon as Broadway reopened. On Sept. 28, the Disney musical \\u201cAladdin\\u201d resumed performances at the New Amsterdam Theater; the very next day, the show closed for 12 days, citing breakthrough cases.\", \"Since then, there have been a handful of closings at other shows \\u2014 the lengthy shutdown at \\u201cChicken & Biscuits,\\u201d and shorter Covid-related shutdowns at \\u201cChicago,\\u201d which went dark for a five-day stretch last month, and \\u201cWicked,\\u201d which lost a weekend early this month. And it\\u2019s not just theater: The acclaimed Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater canceled its performances Wednesday and Thursday, citing positive coronavirus tests.\", \"Plus there have been additional cancellations of \\u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\\u201d and \\u201cAmerican Utopia\\u201d that the producers said were not Covid-related.\", \"\\u201cCanceling random performances can only hurt \\u2014 it just puts the whole confidence that a performance will happen up in the air,\\u201d said Ted Chapin, a longtime industry leader and the former president of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization. \\u201cIt would be nice if Covid could calm down, but it does seem as if during this time when people are not being as diligent as they should be, we may be in this longer than we would like.\\u201d\", \"But thus far, patrons still seem to be flocking to shows. The cancellations are still \\u201ca small number of performances relative to the whole,\\u201d said Victoria Bailey, executive director of the nonprofit Theater Development Fund, which runs the TKTS booth in Times Square. \\u201cWe\\u2019re hyper-aware of it because within the industry we all have this underlying anxiety: \\u2018We need this to last. We need this to last. We need this to keep going.\\u2019 But the average consumer: not so much.\\u201d\", \"Understudies are helping some shows keep going. But in some instances, particularly for new shows, there are not enough replacements ready to go on.\", \"\\u201cIt may be that certain shows have to think about how much coverage they have, and economically whether we can afford to expand coverage,\\u201d said Tom Kirdahy, a lead producer of \\u201cLittle Shop.\\u201d \\u201cIt can\\u2019t be that if one person tests positive, an entire production shuts down \\u2014 that model is unsustainable.\\u201d\", \"One unresolved question: compensation. Thus far, most shows have paid company members even when performances have been canceled, but it is not clear whether that practice will continue.\", \"The cancellations are happening elsewhere as well. Canceled performances are now widespread in London, where theaters have had less stringent safety rules. In Paris, a performance of the ballet \\u201cDon Quixote\\u201d was canceled this week at the Op\\u00e9ra Bastille because of positive cases in its company. And over the summer, lockdowns forced reopened shows to shutter in Australia.\", \"Melissa Castor, a 31-year-old graphic designer, was still at home on Long Island on Saturday when she saw on Twitter that that night\\u2019s performances of \\u201cFreestyle Love Supreme\\u201d had been canceled. \\u201cI was upset, but it\\u2019s not like I had to buy a plane ticket or get a hotel, and I know going in that a show could be canceled,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThis is the age we live in.\\u201d\", \"The reversal of fortune was particularly abrupt for Ben Ratner, a 29-year-old digital producer, who on Sunday morning won a virtual lottery ticket to that day\\u2019s \\u201cMrs. Doubtfire\\u201d matinee, but 90 minutes later got an email saying the show was canceled. \\u201cI was a little annoyed, but also understanding,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI will never blame a production for doing the right thing for safety.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"2a96698a5de611ec88b9511de08d1ced"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2a96698a5de611ec88b9511de08d1ced"}},
