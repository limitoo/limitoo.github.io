But among living filmmakers, the most prodigious world builder might be Pedro Almod\\u00f3var. Plenty of directors have a style. Almod\\u00f3var conjures a cosmos \\u2014 a domain of bright colors, piercing music (often by Alberto Iglesias) and swirling melodrama. If you\\u2019ve visited in the past, you will be eager to return.\", \"This isn\\u2019t to say that Almod\\u00f3varia, as I sometimes think of it, is a realm entirely apart from the drab planet where most of us live. It\\u2019s a version of Spain (most of the time), informed by that country\\u2019s aesthetic and literary traditions, a legacy that encompasses the perverse whimsy of Surrealism and the openhearted pathos of flamenco. \\u201cParallel Mothers,\\u201d Almod\\u00f3var\\u2019s new feature, adds an element that he had previously avoided: the legacy of the Spanish Civil War and the nearly 40 years of dictatorship that followed.\", \"At first, the war seems like an unlikely, poignant entry point into a uniquely Almod\\u00f3varian swirl of present-day romantic complication and domestic anguish. Janis (Pen\\u00e9lope Cruz, never better) is a photographer shooting a very handsome forensic anthropologist for a magazine spread. His name is Arturo (Israel Elejalde), and his grim specialty is examining the remains of Franco\\u2019s victims, many of whom were buried in unmarked mass graves. One of those graves is in Janis\\u2019s hometown. Her great-grandfather was part of a group of men taken from their homes early in the war and never seen again. She asks Arturo if he can help in the investigation.\", \"He offers to do what he can, and then he and Janis sleep together. She gets pregnant \\u2014 he is married \\u2014 and decides to raise their child on her own. All of this happens quickly, and seems like a complicated narrative mechanism designed to introduce Janis to Ana (Milena Smit), a teenager she meets in the maternity ward. Almost simultaneously, they give birth to girls and promise to keep in touch.\", \"Their relationship will pass through friendship, love, devastating loss, deceit and despair. The central plot of \\u201cParallel Mothers\\u201d is vintage Almod\\u00f3var: a skein of reversals, revelations, surprises and coincidences unraveled with style, wit and feeling. The contrasts of background and temperament between Janis and Ana provide the dominant tones. Janis, the child of a hippie mother (who named her after Janis Joplin), was raised by her grandmother. She has grown up to be a practical, independent Madrile\\u00f1a, warmhearted but unsentimental. Her best friend is an elegant magazine editor played by Rossy de Palma, a statuesque avatar of Almod\\u00f3varismo in its purest essence.\", \"Ana is the child of an (unseen) father, who lives in Granada, and a mother, Teresa (Aitana S\\u00e1nchez-Gij\\u00f3n), caught up in her acting career. In spite of Ana\\u2019s unhappy circumstances (her pregnancy is the result of rape), an aura of privilege clings to her family. Teresa, the kind of woman who might have been the heroine of an earlier Almod\\u00f3var picture \\u2014 he is often drawn to theater, and to the toughness and vulnerability of actresses \\u2014 is something of a villain here, an entitled narcissist who can\\u2019t fully acknowledge the reality of her daughter\\u2019s experiences.\", \"Janis doesn\\u2019t exactly replace Teresa in Ana\\u2019s life. She has her own problems to confront, some of which resemble Ana\\u2019s, some of which put them in conflict with each other. \\u201cParallel Mothers,\\u201d in effect, critiques its own title. The two characters mirror each other in some ways, but nobody\\u2019s story moves in a straight line. Entanglement is unavoidable. Almod\\u00f3varian geometry is hyperbolic, non-Euclidean, kinked and convoluted.\", \"But Almod\\u00f3var\\u2019s art is also characterized by emotional precision and moral clarity. What happens to Ana and Janis isn\\u2019t just a matter of accident or narrative artifice; there is a political dimension to their relationship that is the key to the film\\u2019s structure.\", \"When Arturo comes back into the picture, he brings a reminder of unfinished historical business. If, at first, the horror of the past had seemed like the scaffolding for a modern story, the final sections of \\u201cParallel Mothers\\u201d suggest the opposite. Injustice festers across generations. The failure to confront it casts a persistent, ugly shadow.\", \"That shadow is a new element in Almod\\u00f3var\\u2019s imagined universe, and it challenges some of his artistic assumptions. A reality as stark, as brutal, as unresolved as the fascist terror that dominated Spain in the middle decades of the 20th century doesn\\u2019t fit comfortably within his elegant frames and melodramatic conceits. That may be the point of \\u201cParallel Mothers,\\u201d and the rawness of its final scenes is a measure of its accomplishment. We build new worlds to understand the one we\\u2019re in.\"]","href_hash":"f09cbae5642111ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f09cbae5642111ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
