It has just made a bad situation worse.\\\"\", \"Fertiliser Association chief executive Vera Power said the international market is being squeezed.\", \"''At the same time a lot of other countries are looking to secure their own supplies, so they are exporting less and this comes on top of already strained shipping challenges around the world.\", \"\\\"It is certainly making for a very complex international environment.''\", \"Power said the two major fertiliser companies, Ballance Agri Nutrients and Ravensdown, have not been importing product from Russia recently.\", \"She said fertilisers come from a number of countries, including China, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and South Africa.\", \"''There's a huge range of countries.''\", \"''The relationships that the major co-ops have internationally become increasingly important,\\\" she said.\", \"Renwick said the two co-ops, which are responsible for about 95 percent of the imports, will continue to source supplies elsewhere.\", \"''Maybe not a case of we can't get the fertiliser but the fact is we are going to have to pay top dollar to get that fertiliser and that is where the pressure is going to come on to our cost of production, particularly in our dairy sector, where they obviously use a lot for grass to increase dairy production.''\", \"Last year 2.7m tonnes of fertiliser was imported into New Zealand.\", \"Colin Hirst from Federated Farmers said farmers can use less fertiliser for a while, but there's a limit.\", \"''... we can normally handle a year or two of not putting as much on or not at all. It is that whole price versus value thing that farmers will always try and work out and see how it all might pan out.\", \"\\\"Potentially they will use a whole lot less until the prices come back to a more reasonable figure I suppose.''\", \"''It will catch up with you eventually, so it's about maintaining the existing levels of the elements in the soil. If you don't maintain those levels, your productivity will fall away.''\", \"He said the reduction in the use of fertilisers applies to phosphate and potassium, but not nitrogen.\", \"Hirst said the three big expenses for farmers are interest rates, fertiliser and then labour.\", \"On his South Canterbury arable farm he spends about $250,000 a year on fertiliser.\", \"''And we are facing probably a 30 percent rise on that.''\", \"Professor Renwick said when prices rise farmers need to think very carefully how they use fertiliser and to consider other options.\", \"''Maybe use legumes or nitrogen-fixing plants in our system. We can move to perhaps more use of organic fertilisers.\", \"\\\"There is a range of things we can apply to make sure we are getting the maximum out of the fertiliser we are using. It is as much about timing and reducing a little bit but it has a major impact on the system, that is for sure.''\", \"Power said there is no risk of the country running out of fertiliser.\"]","href_hash":"ee4ef51ab71211ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ee4ef51ab71211ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
