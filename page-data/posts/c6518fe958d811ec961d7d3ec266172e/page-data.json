On Oct. 17, 1971, the 765-page volume was reviewed by Frank Freidel, a historian who was four volumes into his own six-volume biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Freidel credits Lash, a lifelong friend of Eleanor Roosevelt\\u2019s, with bringing a fresh eye to her career. \\u201cTo her opponents, Mrs. Roosevelt was the butt of innumerable jokes, a na\\u00efve do-gooder, or even a dangerous radical,\\u201d Freidel writes. \\u201cTo her friends she was a beacon of hope and humanity, both during the Depression and in World War II, when she traveled even to the South Pacific to visit troops. She was the president\\u2019s conscience, and in some ways that of the nation.\\u201d\", \"In a letter dated Nov. 14, 1971, Earl and Dolores Schmidt of Slippery Rock, Pa., respond to Freidel\\u2019s review. They write, \\u201cHere at Slippery Rock State College, in a study of women in American history textbooks used for college survey courses, we chose one woman from each American century as the woman who should be included. Eleanor Roosevelt was our choice for the 20th century. Of 27 textbooks we examined, 15 did not mention her at all. One had a picture, but no textual references. Two mentioned only her name. Five devoted one sentence to her.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c6518fe958d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c6518fe958d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}},
