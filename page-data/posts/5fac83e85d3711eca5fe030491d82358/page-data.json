She also said a male colleague ran his hand up her torso in 2018 at a company event.\", \"She reported the 2017 episode that year to her manager, she said, and the 2018 episode to SpaceX\\u2019s human resources department the day after it happened. She said she never received responses to those complaints. \\u201cGiven my tenuous position at the company, I felt powerless,\\u201d she wrote in the essay.\", \"Ms. Kosak said she reported other incidents to human resources. In one instance, she said, she used an internal tip line that was supposed to be anonymous, but after submitting the complaint, she was contacted by human resources staff who asked her questions about the reported harassment. She took a medical leave of absence last month and resigned from the company later in the month.\", \"Ms. Kosak\\u2019s account shared similarities with accounts from other former interns at the company. The second woman commented on the record, and a third woman who interned for the company and then worked there for five years said she witnessed other instances of harassment, although she did not experience them herself. She also spoke on condition of anonymity because she signed a nondisclosure agreement. A fourth woman who says she experienced harassment also spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity out of concern for her reputation with employers in the space industry.\", \"SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment.\", \"SpaceX has become a dominant company in spaceflight, launching many of the world\\u2019s new satellites and also routinely carrying NASA\\u2019s astronauts to the International Space Station. Earlier this year the company, which was founded by Elon Musk, was awarded a contract to build NASA\\u2019s next ride to the lunar surface.\", \"While Mr. Musk\\u2019s tweets, media appearances and feuds with senators and regulators attract outsize attention, SpaceX highlights the work of female engineers from the company prominently in its live video streams of launches and other media coverage. The company\\u2019s president and chief operating officer, Gwynne Shotwell, is considered essential to its success.\", \"But in the aerospace industry broadly, men outnumber women roughly eight to one, according to census data compiled by Data U.S.A. More women have been sharing stories of sexism and harassment while on the job. Women who work as interns and seek full-time jobs may be particularly vulnerable to harassment and other forms of discrimination, especially when anti-sexual harassment education is scant, as Ms. Kosak said. Human relations departments, including SpaceX\\u2019s, employees say, have not always been quick to discipline or terminate employees who have been the subject of an investigation.\", \"Women at other space companies have also described discriminatory workplace dynamics. In September, a group of 21 current and former employees of Blue Origin, the space company owned by Jeff Bezos, wrote in an essay on Lioness that the company was rife with sexism and retaliated against those who speak up about safety issues. The company has denied the accusations.\", \"Ms. Kosak said in an interview that she felt compelled to go public with her experience at SpaceX after seeing the essay about Blue Origin, which was written by Alexandra Abrams, the company\\u2019s former head of employee communications, who was fired by Blue Origin in 2019.\", \"On Nov. 8, Ms. Kosak said in an interview, she met with Ms. Shotwell and Brian Bjelde, the company\\u2019s human resources chief, about her complaint against the man who she said had groped her in 2018 as well as other sexual discrimination complaints, but made no progress. \\u201cIt was a meeting where I spoke at them, they spoke at me, and we all left and that was that,\\u201d she said.\", \"When Ms. Kosak resigned on Nov. 22, she said the man who touched her in 2018 was still working at SpaceX. The man\\u2019s LinkedIn profile shows he is still employed with the company.\", \"Julia CrowleyFarenga interned for SpaceX from 2015 through 2017 while she was a student at Purdue University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She accused SpaceX in a lawsuit in 2020 of retaliation after she reported uncomfortable interactions with her manager, who would schedule longer performance meetings with her than her male colleagues and repeatedly ask questions about and comment on her dating life. Another manager allowed her to transfer to a different department, she said. But when she applied for a job in 2018, the lawsuit says, she learned the second manager blocked her from getting an offer despite high performance ratings. Ms. CrowleyFarenga and SpaceX settled the lawsuit earlier this year.\", \"The former intern who went on to work for the company for five years said she witnessed and heard about sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior. While rooming with other women during her internships in 2016 and 2017, \\u201chalf of them had stories about situations that made them uncomfortable,\\u201d she said.\", \"The fourth former intern said she, like Ms. Kosak, was harassed while living in housing offered by SpaceX for interns and employees that often put men and women together, sometimes sharing bathrooms. The company buys or rents homes and apartments near SpaceX\\u2019s launch sites, where other housing may be scarce.\", \"In 2012, one former intern said she encountered a male employee who was invited over for drinks by her male housemate. The man became drunk and tried entering her bedroom as she was coming out of the shower, banging on the door and rattling the doorknob after asking her if she was naked.\", \"During the episode, she said, she was also afraid that the drunk co-worker would enter her room through a bathroom door that only her fellow male intern could lock. After a human resources investigation into the episode, the intern said she was told that SpaceX would put in place a new housing policy where bathrooms would be shared only by people of the same sex.\", \"The man remained at the company. \", \"\\u201cIf SpaceX\\u2019s strategy is to hire all these young people, and then not provide any resources on creating an equitable workplace, they\\u2019re sort of setting themselves up for failure,\\u201d Ms. Kosak said.\"]","href_hash":"5fac83e85d3711eca5fe030491d82358"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5fac83e85d3711eca5fe030491d82358"}},
