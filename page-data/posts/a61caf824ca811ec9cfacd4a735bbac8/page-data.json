month, its state boss says, as the negative impacts of rising living costs and COVID-19 continue to hit home.\", \"Foodbank SA and Central Australia chief executive officer Greg Pattinson said the charity's latest annual hunger report found one in six Australians had been \\\"food insecure\\\" this past year.\", \"\\\"It spiked last year when COVID hit because of the hospitality sector closures, and also later in the year when those international students who weren't able to get access to the government support packages identified themselves,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"It\\u00a0levelled off, but then there's been a gradual increase and we're still finding people coming forward and saying:\\u00a0'Look, we need help'.\\\"\", \"The food relief charity categorises\\u00a0food insecurity as when a person experiences\\u00a0multiple disruptions to their eating patterns and often has\\u00a0to reduce their intake.\", \"Its Foodbank Hunger Report 2021 found that while\\u00a017 per cent of Australians could be categorised as being severely food insecure, a further 11 per cent were categorised as being moderately so, meaning the two categories combined at 28 per cent represented a quarter of Australian adults.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Hunger pains for\\u00a01.2 million children</div>\", \"Based largely on a four-stage national survey involving nearly 3,000 Australians and weighted to forecasted population segments, Foodbank's report\\u00a0found that 57 per cent of people impacted by food security went an entire day without eating every week.\", \"<img

serve\\u00a0about 800,000 meals this calendar year.\\u00a0(ABC Radio Adelaide: Malcolm Sutton)</div>\", \"It estimated some 1.2 million children across the country were being impacted by food insecurity, with 43 per cent of affected parents saying every week their children go an entire day without eating.\", \"\\\"What that means for South Australia is, we're currently supporting about 135,000 people a month, and about 74,000 of those are children,\\\" Mr Pattinson said.\", \"He said demand for\\u00a0Foodbank's SA services, particularly in the country, had been increasing by up to 10 per cent annually for the past four to five years.\", \"Mr Pattinson said the survey found the cost of living was by far the biggest contributor, with large utility bills a key factor, along with rising housing and associated rental costs.\", \"\\\"While there might be reasonable prospects for jobs as we come into the next 12 months, the costs that a regular family is going to have to incur look like they're going to get worse.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Daily walk-ins</div>\", \"Woodville Foodbank hub coordinator Brigette Odgers said demand had picked up \\\"enormously\\\" since the new facility on Port Road opened during September to replace its smaller hub at nearby Bowden.\", \"By the end of the calendar year, the hub (along with the former Bowden site)\\u00a0was expected to have provided about 800,000 meals.\", \"Ms Odgers said about 50 to 60 families were coming through the hub daily, including about five to 10 walk-ins who \\\"didn't know much about Foodbank but were just asking how to get food\\\".\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/579fc84ff51baafc54187936f469f9e4\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Foodbank hubs experienced a spike in demand during 2020's onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\u00a0(Image supplied: Foodbank)</div>\", \"She said people were coming from all walks of life, but international students were common, along with hospitality workers who had been stood down during the pandemic.\", \"\\\"It's people who have suffered domestic violence, people caring for sick loved ones, people with kids at home, even people who just can't afford their mortgage,\\\"\\u00a0Ms Odgers said.\", \"\\\"It's such a wide range of people.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Last-resort service\\u00a0</div>\", \"Foodbank is a last-resort service available to people after they have been financially assessed through a community support service.\", \"It can include anyone from the unemployed and socially disadvantaged, to international students and low-income households struggling to keep up with skyrocketing utility bills.\", \"<img

buy heavily discounted foods as well as get free bread, fruit and vegetables.\", \"Because the food is heavily discounted, a typical $30 voucher can buy a customer the equivalent of about $180 worth at a regular supermarket.\", \"Chamath, from Sri Lanka, was among those shopping from the Woodville Foodbank Hub on Monday.\", \"A trained chef living in Australia with his student\\u00a0wife, he said they lost their jobs last year when the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Australia and had been relying on\\u00a0Foodbank for much of the past two years.\", \"\\\"This has been very helpful,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Because of this we can balance our budget.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Supermarkets donating</div>\", \"Foodbank relies heavily\\u00a0on public donations and while it was currently getting enough, Ms Odgers said \\\"it always needs more\\\".\", \"\\\"We buy in goods like your staples, such as rice, pasta, mince and things like that;\\u00a0but the more donations we get, the more variety we can give people,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"It's massively important.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/8c39f9dc06c1ed85b1c5e43a52406b32\\\"

Pattinson said the increasing demand on Foodbank had resulted in the Australian food industry, including supermarkets, \\\"stepping up\\\" their support for the charity.\", \"\\\"At the peak of COVID we had tremendous support right across the country, and indeed in SA from the major retailers and food manufacturers, and the general public themselves,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We're very happy with the response we're getting from the public, but it's an ongoing thing.\", \"\\\"We're a charity and we do need ongoing help to continue to do what we
