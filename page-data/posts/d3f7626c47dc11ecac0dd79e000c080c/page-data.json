For many of us, it's been years or perhaps never.\", \"Sightings of $50 and $100 notes are increasingly rare. During the pandemic, online sales boomed as shops closed. Those that remained open preferred the more hygienic tap-and-go method with bank cards or\\u00a0phone.\", \"So it may surprise you to learn there is a record amount of bank notes circulating in the economy. The\\u00a0problem is, they're mostly stuffed between mattresses or hidden in the nation's sock drawers.\", \"\\\"I'm sure this surprising to many people given their own experiences, as people are using cash less and less,\\\" said Melissa Hope, Head of Note Issue at the RBA.\", \"Before the pandemic, there were about $80 billion in\\u00a0notes circulating in Australia. Within a year, that figure increased to $100 billion \\u2014\\u00a0a 20 per cent increase in a very short period.\", \"As Ms Hope put it, that's \\\"an awful lot of money\\\".\", \"Cash hoarding was noticed earlier in the pandemic but the latest figures from the RBA show that\\u00a0hoarding is continuing.\", \"Most of the cash withdrawn from ATMs during the pandemic was in $50 and $100 notes.\", \"These notes are generally not being used to purchase goods and if you ask your local barista, not many people are buying a latte with a pineapple.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Why is this happening?</div>\", \"The RBA has two theories.\", \"\\\"The first is around economic uncertainty,\\\" Ms Hope said.\", \"\\\"When people are uncertain, you see a sizeable surging in cash demand \\u2014 we saw this during the financial crisis in 2008.\", \"\\\"But there's another reason, too:\\u00a0interest rates are low. People don't lose as much in the way of interest by having their money under the mattress compared to in a bank account.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e20a1541a2684296b49f6bbb691da583\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Most of the bank notes withdrawn were $50 or $100 bills.(Adobe Stock)</div>\", \"In reality, this trend is an anomaly.\\u00a0\", \"People are still moving away from cash, there's no doubt about it.\", \"Cash is still being used to buy coffees or pay for parking, but the long-term trend is clearly moving towards digital transactions.\", \"These changes are one reason why the RBA has announced a review of how banknotes are distributed around the economy.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We are conducting a public consultation to determine what changes we might need to make to the distribution system to make it fit for purpose, acknowledging that cash usage will continue to change,\\\" Ms Hope said.\", \"\\\"We print as many bank notes as what we think will be needed by demand.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"d3f7626c47dc11ecac0dd79e000c080c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d3f7626c47dc11ecac0dd79e000c080c"}},
