John Raymond said the GSSAP satellites, built by Northrop Grumman, provide \\\"a neighborhood watch capability.\\\"\", \"Atlas \\\"allows us to better understand what's going on in the domain, especially in a really critical orbit like geosynchronous orbit,\\\" he said earlier this week. \\\"Historically, the way we have surveilled or had awareness of the domain is we've taken observations from radars or optical capabilities, and we've come up with an address in space, if you will, of objects.\\\"\", \"But he said knowing a satellite's general location is not enough.\", \"\\\"If you move into a war fighting domain, you have to have more knowledge than just where something is,\\\" he said. \\\"You have to have some insights into what those capabilities are, and this neighborhood watch capability has provided us a fuller look at what's in space, specifically in the geosynchronous domain.\\\"\", \"GSSAP satellites provide more accurate tracking data and have the ability to rendezvous with other satellites \\\"enabling characterization for anomaly resolution and enhanced surveillance while maintaining flight safety,\\\" according to an Air Force Space Command fact sheet.\", \"Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News. He covered 129 space shuttle missions, every interplanetary flight since Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune and scores of commercial and military launches. Based at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Harwood is a devoted amateur astronomer and co-author of \\\"Comm Check: The Final Flight of Shuttle Columbia.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"a72ed2bc7af511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a72ed2bc7af511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
