He or Max Verstappen will become champion on Sunday.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-09T02:15:29.000Z","content":"[\"For only the second time in Formula 1 history, two drivers go into the final Grand Prix of a season tied for the championship.\", \"After 21 races, Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen head into the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday facing a winner-takes-all showdown. \\u201cIt is a dream scenario,\\u201d said Daniel Ricciardo of McLaren.\", \"Hamilton of Mercedes is chasing a record-breaking eighth title, Verstappen of Red Bull his first.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s definitely an incredibly intense year and time,\\u201d Hamilton said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve raced for 28 years. I\\u2019ve had so many intense battles through karting, through single-seaters, and this is one of them.\", \"\\u201cOf course, this is the pinnacle of the sport, so everything\\u2019s heightened, everything\\u2019s at the absolute max and so much weighs on it, but it\\u2019s great for the sport, it\\u2019s great for the fans. They\\u2019re enjoying it more than ever, and I\\u2019m enjoying it as a racing driver.\\u201d\", \"There is tension between them on the track, and they have had a number of incidents, including crashes in the British and Italian Grands Prix.\", \"At the last race, in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, Hamilton beat Verstappen, who served two time penalties. The first, of five seconds, was for forcing Hamilton off the circuit. Over the radio, Hamilton described Verstappen as \\u201ccrazy.\\u201d\", \"A 10-second penalty followed for \\u201cerratic\\u201d braking, described in a report by the race stewards, which led to Hamilton running into the back of Verstappen.\", \"After leading by 19 points after consecutive wins in the United States and Mexican races, Verstappen\\u2019s advantage has been erased following three successive victories for Hamilton.\", \"\\u201cBasically, we start again like we started the season,\\u201d Verstappen said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re equal on points now, and that\\u2019s really exciting for the whole championship and Formula 1 in general.\\u201d\", \"Many people hope that the race will be clean on Sunday and the title decided without penalties.\", \"\\u201cOf course, we do care how we win the title,\\u201d Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, said. \\u201cWe want to win it on the track, not in the stewards\\u2019 room, not in a gravel trap.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s been a tough fight all the way through the year, there has been some fantastic racing between these two drivers, and I hope it\\u2019s a fair and clean race in Abu Dhabi.\\u201d\", \"Despite the run of defeats to Hamilton, Horner said he would have no problem raising the morale of Verstappen or his team.\", \"\\u201cAt the beginning of the year, if you\\u2019d given us this chance, this one shot to win this world championship at the last race in Abu Dhabi after 21 races of intense battle with Mercedes, we would have all, as a team, bitten your arm off for that,\\u201d Horner said.\", \"If neither driver scores a point, Verstappen would be champion because he has won nine times, Hamilton eight.\", \"Formula 1 has a history of last-race incidents that have decided championships. Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve collided in 1997 at Jerez, Spain.\", \"Schumacher was stripped of all his points for the season for what was ruled a deliberate attempt to end his rival\\u2019s race. Villeneuve became champion.\", \"Three years earlier, Damon Hill lost the chance to win the title in Adelaide, Australia, after being hit by Schumacher. The stewards did not impose a penalty.\", \"Looking to the race on Sunday, Hill, the 1996 champion, said: \\u201cThere are some people who drive with absolutely no compromises whatsoever, and I think Max is one of those people. He\\u2019s very skillful, brilliant, and it\\u2019s exciting to watch. I think Lewis, who has to deal with that, is now very cautious. He\\u2019s not intimidated, but he\\u2019s very wary of Max and probably rightly so.\\u201d\", \"Current drivers are also enthralled by the battle.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s really what this sport needs, it\\u2019s what you hope for every year, a battle like this,\\u201d said Ricciardo, who was a teammate of Verstappen\\u2019s at Red Bull from 2016 to 2018. \\u201cYou have the veteran with the most records in Lewis on one hand, and then you have the youngest race winner on the other.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re going toe to toe and it\\u2019s a really cool battle, a great story. Some envy not being a part of it, but ultimately for the sport, and as a fan of the sport, it\\u2019s a dream scenario.\\u201d\", \"George Russell of Williams joins Hamilton at Mercedes next season. He can appreciate what both drivers have achieved this season.\", \"\\u201cRed Bull and Max probably had the upper hand at the start of the year, but things have swayed more in Lewis\\u2019 hands in recent events,\\u201d Russell said.\", \"\\u201cThey are both driving excellently, and it is great to see a proper battle going on between the two.\\u201d\", \"Mercedes outscored Red Bull by 23 points in Saudi Arabia and leads the constructors\\u2019 championship by 28.\", \"One of the reasons for the close fights between the drivers and teams has been the success of the budget cap.\", \"In the past, teams had no limit on the amount of money they could spend. This season, they have been capped at $145 million.\", \"\\u201cThis is the first year we\\u2019ve applied the cost cap, and Mercedes and Red Bull have been unable to turn the dial up to 11,\\u201d said Ross Brawn, Formula 1\\u2019s managing director, motorsports. \\u201cThey\\u2019re not allowed to.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s meant the championship has stayed close the whole season. We\\u2019ve not had one team running away with it because they\\u2019ve been able to throw massive resources at any issue.\\u201d\", \"It has led to \\u201ca battle for the ages\\u201d between Hamilton and Verstappen.\", \"\\u201cHaving two drivers within the same team brings an odd dynamic, but when you\\u2019ve two teams, and every mechanic, engineer and team principal on those teams are trying to beat the other, it adds a whole different aspect to it, so we are blessed this year,\\u201d Brawn said.\", \"History beckons for Hamilton. If he wins on Sunday, he will become the first driver with eight championships. He is level with Schumacher at seven.\", \"Hamilton and Mercedes have found form at the right time of the season when it was most needed to reel in Verstappen.\", \"\\u201cIn Saudi Arabia, I saw a passion and excitement within my team that I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019d seen in 10 years, which was amazing,\\u201d Hamilton said.\", \"\\u201cWe continue to fight, no matter what we\\u2019ve experienced as a team. Probably all of us, no matter what we face, we just keep pushing, never give up.\\u201d\", \"Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, said, \\u201cIt is all or nothing in Abu Dhabi.\\u201d\", \"Will the emotions of both drivers and teams be kept in check?\", \"\\u201cThe emotions are running very high, but I don\\u2019t think we need to keep a lid on it,\\u201d Wolff said.\", \"\\u201cThere is a lot of respect between the teams for each other\\u2019s achievements,\\u201d he said, \\u201cand that is why, as long as we have a clean race, fighting for a drivers\\u2019 world championship, it was a great season.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c3e3bce058d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c3e3bce058d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}},
