Andrew Cuomo, as he faced sexual harassment allegations earlier this year.\", \"It was announced on Saturday that he had been fired.\", \"\\\"Chris Cuomo was suspended earlier this week pending further evaluation of new information that came to light about his involvement with his brother's defense,\\\" CNN said in a statement.\", \"\\\"We retained a respected law firm to conduct the review, and have terminated him, effective immediately. While in that process of that review, additional information has come to light. Despite the termination, we will investigate as appropriate.\\\"\", \"CNN's media correspondent Brian Stelter discussed the matter with anchor Jim Acosta on the network on Saturday, saying his former colleague had violated journalistic ethics and norms \\\"not once or twice, but many times.\\\"\", \"Stelter said the recently released information shows Chris Cuomo was \\\"basically acting like a staffer\\\" as his brother fought to keep his job. \\\"And he was doing that at the same time he was working for CNN,\\\" he added.\", \"He also brought up the \\\"additional information\\\" mentioned in the network's statement.\", \"\\\"Just to be completely transparent with the audience, it says there's additional information that also came to light sometime this week,\\\" Stelter said. \\\"We don't know what that is. I've asked. There's no answers coming on what that could be.\\\"\", \"Acosta then asked: \\\"Do we know when this new information might be brought out to the public and will have a sense as to what this additional information was?\\\"\", \"Stelter replied: \\\"I don't know actually if it ever will.

So let me now say as disappointing as this is, I could not be more proud of the team at Cuomo Prime Time and the work we did as CNN's #1 show in the most competitive time slow.
