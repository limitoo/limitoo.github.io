Sometimes, a bit of strategy with finances is required when purchasing a home, which could mean one person's name is on the legal paperwork despite both people contributing to the household. A woman took to Reddit's \\\"Am I the A**hole\\\" forum to ask if she was wrong for telling her friend's fianc\\u00e9 that their new house is not his.\", \"In infinite_zerohero's viral post, which has received more than 12,000 votes and nearly 4,000 comments, she explained her friend, \\\"Ren,\\\" purchased her first house with her fianc\\u00e9 \\\"Jack.\\\"\", \"The Redditor wrote that while at a housewarming party, Ren showed her the county auditor's website where she saw Ren's name on the property records but not Jack's name.\", \"\\\"She said that her credit score alone qualified them for a better interest rate and since her parents gave her the $35k down payment that she didn't want his name on it since she and her family had the most to lose should something negative happen to their relationship or one of them passes away,\\\" infinite_zerohero wrote.\", \"Ren told infinite_zerohero that although his name is not on various legal documents for the house, she sees Jack as a homeowner because they were getting married. Later that evening, while they and other friends at the party were chatting, the Redditor wrote Jack asked her why she referred to the house as \\\"Ren's house\\\" and not \\\"their house.\\\"\", \"\\\"I didn't notice I was saying it, but I told him that maybe it was because the house is not his,\\\" infinite_zerohero wrote. \\\"He asked what I meant and I mentioned the house on the auditor website only had Ren's name on it.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927139/house-sold-sign.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A Redditor received backlash after she told her friend's fianc\\u00e9 he was not a homeowner because his name didn't appear on the property records. Above, a sold sign is pictured outside of a property.</div>\", \"Ren interjected and said that Jack contributed to the bills and the upkeep and lives in the house, so the house belonged to him as well.\", \"\\\"I said with all due respect, it isn't legally,\\\" infinite_zerohero wrote.\", \"Their friends fell silent and Jack told her to leave his property. When the Redditor said it wasn't his property, Ren told infinite_zerohero to leave.\", \"Although the Redditor's father said she wasn't technically wrong and that Ren shouldn't have shown her that Jack's name wasn't on the house, her sister said his name not being on the documents was not relevant and she was out of line.\", \"Fellow Reddit readers agreed with infinite_zerohero's sister.\", \"\\\"Not your business to point this out in such a way,\\\" one of the top comments on the post read. \\\"This sounds as if you wanted the couple to fight and you got your wish, they did fight\\u2014with you.\\\"\", \"Another commenter wrote that while infinite_zerohero was \\\"technically correct\\\" about the paperwork, she shouldn't have said anything to the couple, especially because her friend called it \\\"their house.\\\"\", \"\\\"It's not your place to 'correct' them when they're both happy with the way they've organized things,\\\" a comment read. \\\"You don't get to police [others'] lives.\\\"\", \"Some Redditors wrote that they've done the same thing as Ren and Jack by having just one name on their house. They explained it came down to the opportunities presented to them based on their respective credit scores.\", \"One person commented that it may have made sense for infinite_zerohero to say something if everyone at the housewarming party assumed Jack was responsible for buying the house for Ren and he took full credit.\", \"\\\"But OP steamrolled Ren's feelings in a weird ploy to make Jack look as if he was a deadbeat for taking advantage of her and that she didn't have the agency to want and agree to this arrangement,\\\" the comment read.\", \"The first thought that a commenter had was that infinite_zerohero was jealous and wanted to \\\"stir the pot.\\\"\", \"\\\"I would honestly cut ties with OP immediately if I were this couple,\\\" they wrote. \\\"OP doesn't mean them well. And, she seems to have wanted to cause damage to their relationship & publicly shame the fianc\\u00e9.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"c09dbd293e4e11ecae10d1423d0034f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c09dbd293e4e11ecae10d1423d0034f2"}},
