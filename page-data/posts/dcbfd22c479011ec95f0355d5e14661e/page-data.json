We decided a few years ago that\\u2019s not going to impede us anymore from playing a sport when we want.\\u201d\", \"Four years ago, women in the team\\u2019s small community, Hondzonot, began playing a modified version of baseball in the afternoons. The idea was to get some exercise after completing household chores, and it grew from there. The Diablillas had no gloves and only a homemade bat whittled from wood. They played with a tennis ball. The game followed the rules of baseball, though as in kickball, a runner would be considered thrown out if struck with the ball.\", \"A women\\u2019s team in a nearby town also played the modified baseball game with a tennis ball and challenged the Diablillas to a match. The women of Hondzonot won, received 1,500 pesos (about $75) and uniforms, and were assigned a coach by the local municipality to teach them the rules of softball.\", \"Though they now had jerseys, the Hondzonot women preferred to play softball as they had before \\u2014 barefoot and in huipil dresses, which they make themselves and wear often in the community. This decision would become the defining feature of the Diablillas, and it helped propel them to fame.\", \"\\u201cWe wear the huipil with a lot of pride, and it is something that represents us as Mayan women,\\u201d May Chulim said. \\u201cWe also aren\\u2019t accustomed to wearing shoes, and when we did we just got blisters. Why would we wear something that makes us uncomfortable?\\u201d\", \"As the Diablillas play more games, all friendlies because there is no established softball league for them, in the Mexican states of Quintana Roo and Yucat\\u00e1n, their fame in the region grows. Now, just a few years after learning the rules of softball, they have played in stadiums before thousands of fans. and their faces are on a mural in the nearby resort town Playa del Carmen. Last spring President Andr\\u00e9s Manuel L\\u00f3pez Obrador of Mexico invited May Chulim to appear at one of his daily news conferences in Mexico City.\", \"The team\\u2019s stardom has brought change in perceptions among men in the town. While members of the Diablillas used to request permission for something as simple as leaving the home, they now say they feel more liberated and empowered.\", \"\\u201cAs we have improved on the field, my life has improved as well,\\u201d said Alicia Canul Dzib, who plays second base and pitches for the Diablillas. \\u201cI used to really only leave the house to help my husband with our crops. Now thanks to softball, I have permission to leave the house, enjoy myself with friends and visit new towns. It motivates me to keep playing and set an example for my daughter.\\u201d\", \"The example set by the Diablillas has made women on the Yucat\\u00e1n Peninsula \\u2014 and in the rest of the country \\u2014 hopeful about more resources for a sport that, despite a fourth-place finish by the Mexican team at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, has received intermittent and limited support at a national level. Though for nearly a century Mexico has had a countrywide professional baseball league that at times features Major League Baseball players, women\\u2019s softball leagues are offered only at state and municipal levels.\", \"There is hope, however, that the popularity of the Diablillas and the Amazonas will represent a \\u201cwatershed moment\\u201d for the growth of the sport in Mexico, Abel Fern\\u00e1ndez, president of the Quintana Roo state baseball association, said in a recent telephone interview.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not common for Mayan or Indigenous women to be involved in sports in their communities, and the Diablillas are breaking those stereotypes,\\u201d Fern\\u00e1ndez said, adding that Quintana Roo had recently created a state softball association. \\u201cThey\\u2019ve generated a lot of attention, and now we\\u2019re seeing a boom in interest in softball and sports among women in the region.\\u201d\", \"At a recent practice, the Amazonas, 15 players ages 15 to 64, communicated in a mix of Mayan and Spanish, roared with laughter and tossed the ball around the diamond as some of the their goats bleated from the outfield, where they were tied to trees.\", \"Like the Diablillas, the Amazonas have become increasingly sought as opponents for teams of women who wear cleats and typical uniforms. And in July, the Amazonas were invited to appear on the field of the Yucat\\u00e1n Leones, the professional baseball organization based in M\\u00e9rida, the state capital.\", \"The team captain, Fermina Dzid Dzul, said that since forming three years ago the team had fought to alter gender paradigms about sports participation in Yaxunah.\", \"\\u201cWhen I first started playing, the men in my family said jokes and comments like \\u2018You\\u2019re just wasting your time playing softball,\\u2019\\u201d said Alvi Yajaira Diaz Poot, who plays several positions for the Amazonas. \\u201cNow when I come home from games they are eager to know how the game went and even bring me something to drink.\\u201d\", \"And while the Amazonas and Diablillas know of each other and are aware of their similarities, neither is pushing for a head-to-head match to determine the best Mayan women\\u2019s softball team on the Yucat\\u00e1n Peninsula.\", \"They understand their success and inclusion in the sport mean that they have already both won.\"]","href_hash":"dcbfd22c479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dcbfd22c479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}},
