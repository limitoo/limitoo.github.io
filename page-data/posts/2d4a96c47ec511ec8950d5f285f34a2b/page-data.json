The terror group swarmed sleeper cells from the region around the facility and then waited for the right moment. Last week, as guards huddled up against bitter cold weather, about 200 ISIS militants stormed the prison, led by suicide car bombs targeting the facility and fuel tankers at a nearby gas station. They used the smoke to help shield them from U.S.-led coalition helicopters and drones.\", \"SDF sources told CBS News the operation to reassert control over the prison took almost a week partly due to the forces' concern about the lives of nearly 800 underaged prisoners, know as ISIS \\\"cubs,\\\" who they said the terrorists were using as human shields.\", \"Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said on Friday that the U.S.-led coalition in Syria had \\\"provided some airstrikes to support them [SDF] as they deal with this prison break.\\\"\", \"Journalists on the ground posted videos showing what appeared to be American special forces working closely with the Kurdish fighters.\", \"The #SDF, with @Coalition support, is valiantly leading ops securing the Hasakah Detention Facility.

They discussed tightening security along the Syrian border.\", \"Iraqi journalist and activist Dlovan Barwari told CBS News that almost a third of the prisoners held at the facility in al-Hasaka were believed to be Iraqi ISIS fighters, so Iraq has legitimate fears about the fate of any who did manage to escape - especially after ISIS proving that it remains capable of conducting such a large-scale, organized operation.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"2d4a96c47ec511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2d4a96c47ec511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
