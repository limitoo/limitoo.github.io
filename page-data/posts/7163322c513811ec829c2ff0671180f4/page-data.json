But it will likely be a week, possibly two weeks, before experts know more about the new variant. It has mutations that scientists fear could make it more infectious and less susceptible to vaccines \\u2014 though evidence to support those fears has yet to be established.\", \"Despite significant questions about the variant itself, countries around the world have rushed to defend against its spread, with a cascade of border closures and travel restrictions that recalled the earliest days of the pandemic. The variant has yet to be detected in the United States.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re learning more about this new variant every single day,\\u201d he said, \\u201cand as we learn more, we\\u2019re going to share that information with the American people candidly and promptly.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden was elected on a promise to bring the pandemic under control \\u2014 a task that is proving easier said than done. Viruses are by nature wily creatures, dedicated to ensuring their own survival, and that is especially true of the virus that causes Covid-19. Just as Mr. Biden was about to declare \\u201cindependence from the virus\\u201d on the July 4 holiday, the Delta variant swept across the United States, causing another wave of hospitalizations and deaths.\", \"Now there is Omicron, discovered in southern Africa and designated by the World Health Organization on Friday as a \\u201cvariant of concern.\\u201d \", \"Mr. Biden is trying to project an image of calm, and to keep the country from panicking, while also ensuring that Americans remain vigilant by getting vaccinated and taking other steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, including masking and social distancing.\", \"The emergence of the new variant is also stepping up pressure on Mr. Biden and his administration to do more to share vaccines with the rest of the world, though there are some complicating factors.\", \"South Africa, whose scientists detected the variant, has fully vaccinated only 24 percent of its population, according to data from the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. It has a better vaccination rate than most countries on the continent, but has asked vaccine makers to stop sending doses; it is having trouble getting shots into arms, in part because many people are hesitant to take it.\", \"Some experts argue those vaccine inequities are the reason for the emergence of the variant.\", \"\\u201cThis is precisely what experts have been predicting was going to happen \\u2014 that the extraordinary inequities and gaps between low income countries and high income countries creates this massive vulnerability and its going to continue to generate these dangerous variants,\\u201d said J. Stephen bbring Morrison, a global health expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \\u201cThat point is glaringly obvious and it\\u2019s painful.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden\\u2019s top health advisers, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, spent much of the holiday weekend consulting with their South African counterparts. The White House said that Mr. Biden met on Sunday with members of his Covid response team, including Dr. Fauci, the nation\\u2019s top infectious disease expert.\", \"With much still unknown about the Omicron variant, Dr. Fauci told the president that it would take approximately two more weeks to learn more about its transmissibility and severity, the White House said, but that \\u201che continues to believe that existing vaccines are likely to provide a degree of protection against severe cases of Covid.\\u201d\", \"Administration officials \\u2014 including the president himself \\u2014 are encouraging the public to maintain vigilance and safeguard public health through inoculations, masking indoors and distancing.\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t know the level of severity of it; we don\\u2019t have enough information yet,\\u201d Dr. Fauci said in an interview over the weekend, adding, \\u201cThis is all the more reason to get vaccinated.\\u201d\", \"Appearing on morning talk shows on Sunday, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, cautioned Americans that the emergence of Omicron and the uncertainty that surrounds it are reminders that the pandemic is far from over.\", \"\\u201cI know, America, you\\u2019re really tired about hearing those things, but the virus is not tired of us,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd it\\u2019s shape-shifting itself.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cPlease, Americans, if you\\u2019re one of those folks who\\u2019s sort of waiting to see, this would be a great time to sign up, get your booster,\\u201d Dr. Collins said on Fox. \\u201cOr if you haven\\u2019t been vaccinated already, get started.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"7163322c513811ec829c2ff0671180f4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7163322c513811ec829c2ff0671180f4"}},
