As everyone hollered, spilled drinks and accused each other of double-dipping chips, the clamor made me lightheaded.\", \"I stole downstairs to the basement, blessedly cool and quiet, and took a few breaths.\", \"\\u201cHello,\\u201d a voice behind me said quietly. It was my father, leaning against the washing machine in the dark.\", \"I squinted. \\u201cDad? Is everything OK?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYep,\\u201d he said cheerfully.\", \"I realized we were doing the same thing: hiding.\", \"I didn\\u2019t want to encroach on Dad\\u2019s refuge, so I pretended to look for an extra platter, then headed back upstairs.\", \"We both knew that, even in the best of times, holiday social gatherings can be overwhelming.\", \"Last winter, with the Covid-19 pandemic in full force, some families sat out the festivities, keeping celebrations with friends and family small or virtual. Some even admitted that the slower pace worked for them, said Thema Bryant, President-Elect of the American Psychological Association and a professor of psychology at Pepperdine University. Now, with nearly 60 percent of the country fully vaccinated and restrictions loosened, all the things we took a pass on last year seem to be roaring back \\u2014 and many are feeling uncomfortably out of practice when it comes to social situations. Not everyone, it turns out, is ready to party like it\\u2019s 2019.\", \"\\u201cAfter being isolated for so many months, I found I needed baby steps to reintegrate,\\u201d said Dalia MacPhee, a fashion designer in Los Angeles. At first, MacPhee said, she \\u201cfelt like Tom Hanks\\u2019 character from Castaway as he re-enters society. I\\u2019m definitely feeling some social anxiety.\\u201d\", \"That\\u2019s a refrain that Paula Zimbrean, a psychiatrist and associate professor at Yale School of Medicine, has heard a lot. \\u201cHonestly, if a patient tells me that he or she has no anxiety about resuming life as usual, I start worrying,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThere will be a good deal of relearning and readjusting about being in social situations, and we have to be forgiving with ourselves and others about it.\\u201d\", \"If your calendar is filling up this month, here\\u2019s how to ease into the holiday spirit.\", \"As the holiday season cranks up, said Dr. Zimbrean, \\u201cit\\u2019s a great opportunity to re-evaluate what relationships are meaningful to us and how much time we want to invest in them.\\u201d Some people realized that accepting every invitation \\u201cwas actually not enjoyable and made things unnecessarily frenetic.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe all only have so much social energy these days,\\u201d said Ty David Lerman, a psychotherapist with Southwest Psychotherapy Associates in Houston. To determine whether he really wants to go to an event, Mr. Lerman devised what he called a \\u201cHell, Yes\\u201d philosophy. \\u201cThis is to only commit to events where your response is, \\u201cHell, yes, I want to do that!\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf I\\u2019m not that excited about it, I will likely pass.\\u201d He tells clients that while it may be tempting to dive headlong into the holiday season, it\\u2019s important to seek middle ground. As he puts it, \\u201cGoldilocks your life.\\u201d\", \"Sarah Ahmed, co-founder of Wellnest, a psychotherapy clinic in Toronto, agreed. \\u201cI know for me, I cap out at two events a week, a number that was much higher prepandemic,\\u201d she said. Use your body, she suggested, as an indicator to tell if you\\u2019ve reached capacity. \\u201cOur bodies are constantly talking to us,\\u201d said Ahmed. Common symptoms of social anxiety, she said, include exhaustion, headaches, sweating, difficulty speaking, nausea and increased heart rate. \\u201cIf you are feeling particularly fatigued after a social event, I\\u2019d revisit future commitments that week.\\u201d\", \"If you\\u2019re turning down an invitation, Dr. Lerman said, do it as early as possible, and keep your explanation brief and polite. (\\u201cThat sounds fun, but I will need to pass this time,\\u201d or \\u201cThanks for the invite, but I already have plans.\\u201d)\", \"On the day of a holiday get-together, vow to be extra gentle with yourself, said Dr. Bryant. \\u201cDo things that you know will soothe and calm you, like playing music beforehand that puts you in a festive mood.\\u201d\", \"Make a post-event plan of self-care, too, she advised. \\u201cIt may be that you promise yourself, \\u2018I\\u2019m going to have a bubble bath after and a hot cup of green tea,\\u2019 or maybe you schedule a call with a person that you trust, and as soon as you get in that parking lot you know you can call them to debrief.\\u201d\", \"If you are feeling overwhelmed at an event, create a little space to reorient yourself. \\u201cDepending on the neighborhood, you can take a quick walk, just to get fresh air,\\u201d said Dr. Bryant. If the walls are closing in at a family affair, \\u201cvolunteer to be the errand person: \\u201cOh, we didn\\u2019t get enough butter? I\\u2019ll go!\\u201d\", \"And it\\u2019s a perfectly acceptable conversation-starter to \\u201cacknowledge and normalize the awkwardness\\u201d during this transitional phase, said Ahmed. \\u201cYou can say, \\u201cMy brain is remembering how to socialize, so pardon me if I\\u2019m still a bit rusty.\\u201d\", \"If you only feel up to attending an event for an hour, tell the host as soon as possible, said Monica Lewis, co-founder (with her husband, Darian) of the Monica Lewis School of Etiquette in Houston. Or you can ask when the best time would be to swing by. \\u201cThey may say, \\u2018Oh, make sure you\\u2019re here for the cocktail hour,\\u2019 or \\u2018I don\\u2019t want you to miss the gift exchange,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Lewis said.\", \"If the host has no time preference, added Mr. Lewis, the ideal time to show up for the socially anxious is \\u201cright when it starts, because most people won\\u2019t get there on time, and you can ease your way into conversations. You\\u2019re not walking into a fully packed event.\\u201d\", \"If you plan to limit your time during a family gathering, let them know as soon as they start making plans. \\u201cDo it early,\\u201d he suggested. \\u201cIt is not the time to have the conversation while you\\u2019re standing on the doorstep.\\u201d\", \"Nervousness before coming into a social setting is common, said Itai Danovitch, an associate professor and chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. \\u201cBut if you find that your anxiety is distressing and disproportionate and interferes with your daily living, and is preventing you from doing things that you would otherwise be doing, then that impact on function is an indicator that there\\u2019s a problem.\\u201d If this anxiety is persistent and recurs in multiple settings, Dr. Danovitch added, \\u201cit\\u2019s a good idea to be evaluated by a professional to determine if you have an anxiety disorder.\\u201d\", \"In a social setting, said Mr. Lewis, first \\u201cdo what you have to do to feel safe and comfortable.\\u201d After that, he said, \\u201ctry your best to relax and have fun. We have waited almost two years for this moment! Be as present as you can.\\u201d\", \"To loosen up, suggested Dr. Lerman, give yourself an internal pep-talk on why you\\u2019re there to begin with. \\u201cTell yourself, \\u2018I\\u2019m going to focus on celebrating my friend,\\u2019 or \\u2018I really love my partner and know this means a lot to them, so I\\u2019m going to try to be here for them and let go of things I cannot control.\\u2019\\u201d Dr. Lerman calls deep breathing his favorite coping tool \\u201cbecause it\\u2019s so covert \\u2014 you can be deep breathing while in conversation. It helps us ground ourselves inside our body and naturally combats any fight, flight or freeze that may arise from a stress response.\\u201d\", \"Who knows? Maybe you\\u2019ll be having so much fun that you\\u2019ll be the last to leave. In which case, Mr. Lewis has a final bit of etiquette advice. \\u201cIf your host has started taking out their contact lenses,\\u201d he said, \\u201cit\\u2019s time to go.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f5cd3f144d4e11ecbae72dc5012f6949"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f5cd3f144d4e11ecbae72dc5012f6949"}},
