Two dogs, who happen to be best friends, just went viral for their sweet reunion. A dog named Olive has a special friendship with another dog named Solo, and after two weeks apart, it's clear these two missed each other.\", \"The Dodo tweeted the video, which now has over 135,000 views. Olive and her owner go to a park every morning where she will wait patiently for her best bud to join her. The video showed her looking all around, including just staring off in the direction Solo usually comes from. The video then goes on to show how the pair repeat their greeting every morning.\", \"However, when Solo doesn't come one morning, the video showed Olive waiting patiently for her best friend to arrive, but to no avail.\", \"\\\"She's very disappointed when Solo doesn't turn up,\\\" Olive's owner explained in the video.\", \"Dogs are very sociable animals dog behaviorist Dr. Nicholas Dodman said, according to Animal Wellness Magazine. Dodman stated that it is beneficial for them to have other dogs to interact with, which will fulfill their \\\"social needs.\\\"\", \"\\\"The best way to fill your dog's social needs is to get him out every day to mix with other dogs, or to get another dog,\\\" explained Dodman.\", \"For two weeks, Solo was gone for the holidays, and therefore Olive and Solo didn't see each other during that time, the narrator explained in the video.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952374/two-dogs-milan-snow.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Two dogs named Olive and Solo reunited after two weeks apart in a sweet moment captured in viral video. Two dogs in Milan in the snow on December 8. </div>\", \"\\\"We couldn't go to the same park because Olive knows that's Solo's park, so we actually had to go and find a different park for two weeks,\\\" Olive's owner said in the video. \\\"Otherwise, Olive will just sit and wait on the hill for Solo to turn up.\\\"\", \"The reunion between the pair was caught on camera as Olive sat as she waited patiently for Solo to arrive. When she finally saw Solo, she ran toward her friend, and they proceeded to run and play together. Olive even toppled Solo over during the encounter. They also spent some time sniffing and reacquainting themselves with each other before the play continued.\", \"\\\"They both were so excited to see each other that morning,\\\" Olive's owner said in the video.\", \"Viewers were taken with the video. \\\"It's so cute how they're playing together,\\\" said one Twitter user.\", \"Another admits the video actually brought tears to their eyes. \\\"This made me cry,\\\" they said.\", \"One viewer called Olive and Solo's friendship \\\"beautiful,\\\" and it's clear to see why.\", \"\\\"Oh my heart!\\\" a Twitter user wrote. \\\"Such a beautiful friendship.\\\"\", \"Olive and Solo's owners actually met because of their dogs, and they are \\\"close friends\\\" as well, Olive's owner said in the video. The dogs hang out regularly, and not just at the park. These two have a solid bond, and it's sweet to see their friendship.\", \"Follow Olive's story on her Instagram page @olivethebmd.\"]","href_hash":"9da43f625dcd11ec87d345d49f11332b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9da43f625dcd11ec87d345d49f11332b"}},
