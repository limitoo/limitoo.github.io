Although the government did move quickly to reduce fears, rumors began to circulate online about a possible escalation with Taiwan.\", \"The tensions between the two countries have been heightening. According to AP, China has been sending more warplanes near the island nation amid the U.S. beginning to sell arms to Taiwan. However, analysts and Chinese citizens do not predict that war is coming to either country.\", \"Despite this hesitancy, rumors regarding a potential escalation spread throughout social media and prompted many to begin mass purchasing and hoarding supplies. Stores have also started posting messages on their windows asking customers to purchase a reasonable amount of goods. These messages also urge consumers not to listen to unfounded rumors online.\", \"\\\"I do not believe that the country wants to send a signal to the public at this time through a notice from the Commerce Ministry that people need to 'hurry up and prepare for war,'\\\" wrote Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Chinese newspaper The Global Times, in a statement.\", \"The government-owned newspaper The Economic Daily clarified that the advice was meant to prepare citizens for another potential COVID-19 lockdown.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926322/chinese-supermarket-notice.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">China has recommended that citizens purchase and store supplies in case of an emergency, sparking speculation and stockpiling.

One person shared a screenshot of a list of recommended emergency equipment for families issued in August by the government in Xiamen, a coastal city near an outlying Taiwanese island. An unverified report\\u2014denied Wednesday by a military-affiliated social media account\\u2014said veterans were being called back to service to prepare for combat.\", \"It's difficult to gauge how many people interpreted the notice as a possible prelude to war, but the reaction was strong enough to prompt a state media response the next day.\", \"Zhang Xi, another Beijing resident, ruled out the possibility of war and counseled patience in a dispute extending to when Taiwan and China split during the civil war that brought Mao Zedong's Communists to power in 1949.\", \"\\\"This is a leftover from history, and it's impossible to solve this right away,\\\" she said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926317/chinese-supermarket-2020.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">China has recommended that citizens purchase and store supplies in case of an emergency, sparking speculation and stockpiling.</div>\"]","href_hash":"5f018b063d8811ecb19a000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5f018b063d8811ecb19a000017025a03"}},
