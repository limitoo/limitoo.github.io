Earlier he reported powerful explosions in Lviv's eastern outskirts from the strikes.\", \"\\\"Stay in shelters! Do not go out into the streets!,\\\" he warned after the first strike.\", \"The rockets fell as US President Joseph Biden, speaking in Warsaw during a visit to Poland, condemned Russian aggression and assured Ukraine of the United States's unwavering support.\", \"In his speech, Biden addressed the Russian people on their leader President Vladimir Putin, telling them: \\\"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power.\\\"\", \"The Kremlin responded that was not for the US leader to say.\", \"\\\"That's not for Biden to decide.
