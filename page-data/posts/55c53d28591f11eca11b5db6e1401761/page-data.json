Officials at the United Nations organization worried that the emergence of the Omicron variant would scare richer nations into hoarding vaccine supplies, potentially prolonging the lingering pandemic.\", \"\\\"What is going to shut down disease is for everybody who is especially at risk of disease to become vaccinated,\\\" said Dr. Kate O'Brien, head of the WHO's department of immunization, vaccines and biologicals. \\\"We seem to be taking our eye off that ball in countries.\\\"\", \"After low-income countries saw months of vaccine shortages, donation programs like COVAX and other initiatives began to increase their supply in the last couple months. The WHO, which has long condemned and warned against the impacts of so-called \\\"vaccine inequity,\\\" wants to prevent the vast majority of vaccine doses from going to wealthier countries again as the world looks to tamp down the Omicron variant.\", \"\\\"As we head into whatever the omicron situation is going to be, there is risk that the global supply is again going to revert to high-income countries hoarding vaccine to protect\\u2014in a sense, in excess\\u2014their opportunity for vaccination, and a sort of 'no-regrets' kind of approach,\\\" O'Brien said.\", \"The WHO official said that the only way the pandemic can be fully stopped is by immunizing the masses rather than to keep providing doses to residents of wealthier countries.\", \"\\\"It's not going to work,\\\" she said. \\\"It's not going to work from an epidemiological perspective, and it's not going to work from a transmission perspective unless we actually have vaccines going to all countries, because where transmission continues, that's where the variants are going to come from.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948640/who-warns-vax-shortages.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The World Health Organization expressed concerns that rich countries spooked by the emergence of the Omicron variant could step up hoarding of COVID-19 vaccines and strain global supplies again.

Vaccine makers are racing to update their COVID-19 shots against the newest coronavirus threat even before it's clear a change is needed.\", \"\\\"At this stage, we do not have enough data on the impact of this variant on the effectiveness of the approved vaccines. But we are continuously scanning the horizon to gather evidence in this regard. In any case, we are preparing to take rapid action should the need arise,\\\" Marco Cavaleri, head of biological health threats and vaccines strategy at the European Medicines Agency, said during an online media briefing.\", \"Cavaleri said that the agency expects that \\\"in a matter of three to four months we will be in the position of approving a variant vaccine for omicron.\\\" The time scale is from the start of development until approval, the agency said after the briefing.\", \"Cavaleri also said that the EU agency expects to give the green light to a fifth vaccine for use in the 27-nation bloc before the end of the year, with a decision on a request for authorization of American biotechnology company Novavax's coronavirus vaccine.\", \"Some wealthy governments want to leave no stone unturned to get their populations as close to full vaccination as possible. Many questions remain about the severity, transmissibility and resistance to vaccines of the new Omicron variant, which emerged last month in southern Africa and has shown early signs of spreading faster than the widespread and deadly Delta variant driving the pandemic now.\", \"O'Brien urged a \\\"rational, global perspective\\\" about \\\"what's actually going to shut down this pandemic.\\\"\", \"\\\"We have the tools at hand, we have the choices we can make, and the next days and weeks are really going to determine what direction the world decides it's going to go in, on omicron,\\\" she said.\", \"Nevertheless, WHO says individuals in rich countries should follow the policies of their governments, some of which are enticing people to get boosters, which are additional doses aimed to buck up immunity from earlier jabs that wanes over time.\", \"\\\"An individual in a country, their dose is not going to get shipped to another country because they don't take the dose,\\\" O'Brien said. \\\"It is country governments, not individuals, who are making decisions that could influence the equitable distribution of vaccines to other countries.\\\"\", \"The Associated Press contributed to this report.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948643/who-headquarters.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The World Health Organization advised the world's wealthier governments Thursday to avoid the widespread use of COVID-19 booster shots and instead send more doses to low-income countries experiencing vaccine shortages.
