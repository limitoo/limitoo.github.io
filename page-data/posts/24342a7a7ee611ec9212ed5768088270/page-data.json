Island's northern tip and splitting the island in two.\\u00a0\", \"High tides and huge seas driven by Seth carved a passage through the northern end of Bribie Island at the end of last year.\", \"Experts say the new bar could take up to 20 years to close and will eventually become the preferred entry to Caloundra.\", \"The island's northern tip has gradually been thinning on the ocean and Pumicestone Passage sides, with the surf briefly running over the dunes into the passage during the middle of\\u00a0last year.\", \"The evolving passage\\u00a0is now 300 metres wide with a depth of 1.5 metres at high tide and 1 metre at low tide.\", \"It is so treacherous that two 24-hour cameras were donated and installed to monitor the area after calls for help to the coast guard increased.\",

Island will eventually break up and become sandbars again,\\\" Mr Pearce said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/cdcc62e5c476275033dbae9b1c712af4\\\"
