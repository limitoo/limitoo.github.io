For a few minutes he walked the aisles of the MO Lounge at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in midtown Manhattan, a cellphone pressed to one ear as he strolled tantalizingly close to our table, then veered off in another direction as he continued the conversation.\", \"Then, in one seamless motion, Hart ended the call, slid into a chair across from me and switched effortlessly into face-to-face conversation mode.\", \"\\u201cTalk to me, let\\u2019s go,\\u201d he said.\", \"Hart, the 42-year-old stand-up and comic actor, keeps a relentlessly busy schedule and he seems to like it that way. You can catch him pretty much round-the-clock in lighthearted adventures like the \\u201cJumanji\\u201d series; dramedies like \\u201cThe Upside\\u201d and \\u201cFatherhood\\u201d; animated features like \\u201cThe Secret Life of Pets\\u201d; his commercials for Chase banking; any of his past stand-up specials; or his streaming talk show, \\u201cHart to Heart.\\u201d Hours after we spoke, it was announced that the diminutive Hart will play Gary Coleman\\u2019s role in a live TV re-enactment of \\u201cDiff\\u2019rent Strokes.\\u201d And on Tuesday, his comedy album \\u201cZero _____ Given\\u201d was nominated for a Grammy.\", \"To this expansive r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 you can now add the Netflix series \\u201cTrue Story,\\u201d a seven-episode thriller starring Hart as a celebrity who is racing to cover up a death he may or may not be responsible for.\", \"In \\u201cTrue Story,\\u201d which is scheduled for release on Wednesday, Hart plays a mega-popular comedian and actor known simply as the Kid. Following a misguided night out with his struggling older brother, Carlton (Wesley Snipes), Kid awakens in a hotel room next to the body of a dead woman \\u2014 and then undertakes a series of increasingly reckless decisions in order to cover up her death and protect his career.\", \"You might wonder if Hart can handle such a role, with its life-or-death stakes and occasionally brutal action scenes. He shares none of these concerns. As Hart explained to me between bites of French fries and sips of coffee, \\u201cTrue Story\\u201d was created to show that he is as capable of hard-edge drama as he is of any other genre. (Hart is also an executive producer on the series.)\", \"\\u201cWhen it\\u2019s all said and done with me and my career, people are going to realize that I\\u2019ve checked every box,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThis is just to simply show, I got that. This is in my bag. If I get the itch to do it, I\\u2019ll create the thing to scratch it.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cTrue Story\\u201d arose from this ambition and from Hart\\u2019s conversations with Eric Newman, an executive producer and showrunner of the crime dramas \\u201cNarcos\\u201d and \\u201cNarcos: Mexico.\\u201d\", \"Newman, the creator of \\u201cTrue Story\\u201d and a writer on the series, said in a phone interview that Hart wanted to play a character who was similar to himself but who was driven to desperate measures by what he considered an existential threat.\", \"But, Newman said of the show\\u2019s protagonist: \\u201cHis version of existential threat might be different than yours or mine. I might perhaps be driven to do something horrible if my children were in jeopardy. In the case of a celebrity, a famous person, if you take their career away, that is a fate worse than death.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cTrue Story\\u201d is largely fictionalized, but Hart\\u2019s real life has not lacked for drama. He is only two years removed from a car accident in which he sustained major back injuries, requiring surgery and rehabilitation, and which he has said left him a changed man. And it has been almost three years since he stepped down as host of the Academy Awards after some of his past jokes and comments were criticized as homophobic.\", \"While Hart has continued to reflect on the Oscars controversy, he has also received renewed public support from Dave Chappelle, his friend and fellow stand-up, who said in his recent Netflix special, \\u201cThe Closer,\\u201d that Hart was treated unfairly. (\\u201cThe Closer\\u201d has itself been criticized as transphobic, and dozens of Netflix employees walked out of the company\\u2019s Los Angeles office last month in protest.)\", \"Hart spoke further about his desire to make \\u201cTrue Story,\\u201d the facts and fiction behind the series and his understanding of the criticism that he and Chappelle have received. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.\", \"\\u201cTrue Story\\u201d is far darker than anything we\\u2019ve seen you in before. What made you want to do this?\", \"The goal was to present a side of my talent that would never be expected. The best way to do that was to kill. How do I kill on camera? Blunt, just like that. In entertainment, the joy is doing the things that you can never do in life. Comedy has presented the opportunity to be funny in different ways. Buddy-cop movies. Action-adventure. It\\u2019s given me a world where I\\u2019ve been able to play and have fun. Well, this is the complete opposite. I\\u2019m still playing, but I get to be dark as hell.\", \"Is there a chance your audience won\\u2019t accept you in something like \\u201cTrue Story\\u201d?\", \"When you start doing it for the perceptions of others, you\\u2019re never going to win. Your biggest believer in what you do should be you. Me wanting to do drama is because I know I can do it. I know I\\u2019m good at it. So I\\u2019m going to do it and put this out there. I would never put that much power in someone else, to think that their opinion controls my narrative.\", \"What was it about \\u201cNarcos\\u201d that made you want to work with Eric Newman?\", \"Eric made you root for a bad guy. Although we all know how Pablo Escobar dies, you still found yourself rooting for Pablo when he\\u2019s running from the officers on a roof. You find yourself going, \\u201cCome on Pablo, get out of there.\\u201d For me, I said: \\u201cI have to be believable in this space. If I\\u2019m going to kill, how do I make people care about me in the same way?\\u201d\", \"The nonstop demands of the professional world that Kid inhabits on \\u201cTrue Story\\u201d seem pretty punishing. Is that how your work feels to you?\", \"When we were in the development process, I explained my world to Eric. Everybody\\u2019s giving you their energy, good or bad. Their problems. It\\u2019s: \\u201cI need you to do \\u2014 \\u201d \\u201cCan you \\u2014 ?\\u201d \\u201cYou know what\\u2019s going on with me, you think you can help?\\u201d When is it too much? Nobody wants to hear that you don\\u2019t want to, or that you can\\u2019t. So you find yourself getting pushed around.\", \"Do you find, as he does, that there are temptations to bad behavior around every corner?\", \"[Expletive] yes, it\\u2019s still there! It\\u2019s so easy to do dumb [expletive]. It\\u2019s available whenever you want it. Doing the right thing, living life correctly, there\\u2019s a conscious effort behind it. And it\\u2019s work. Not to say it\\u2019s work in a bad way, but you\\u2019re working constantly to make sure that you\\u2019re doing things correctly, appropriately. You need a good team around you that\\u2019s OK with saying no.\", \"How did you get Wesley Snipes to play the role of Kid\\u2019s brother, Carlton?\", \"As we really started to get into this character, we realized he was such an important piece of the puzzle. We need a real good actor that can pull Carlton off, and Wesley Snipes\\u2019s name came up. We were like, \\u201cDo you think we can get him?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to reach out.\\u201d Wesley thought it was a comedy at first; he was a little distant. I had to explain to him that this was serious and I wasn\\u2019t joking. When he latched onto the material, he said: \\u201cOK, you\\u2019d better bring it. Because if I do it, that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m expecting.\\u201d I said, \\u201cSay no more.\\u201d\", \"[Hart excuses himself to go to the bathroom. When he returns, he is again speaking on his cellphone, this time to the filmmaker F. Gary Gray, who is directing Hart\\u2019s upcoming heist movie, \\u201cLift.\\u201d]\", \"Is this how many balls you have to juggle to make it as an entertainer these days?\", \"My reality is insane. The amount of things that I\\u2019m able to manage and delegate and operate at the same time, it\\u2019s mind-blowing. It\\u2019s a talent within a talent. I can multitask like nobody else\\u2019s business.\", \"I assume you could dial this all back if you wanted to \\u2014 just do one or two projects a year?\", \"Then what am I supposed to do with the rest of the year? [Laughs.] I\\u2019ll be twiddling my thumbs. I\\u2019ll go crazy, man.\", \"Dave Chappelle spoke in your defense at the end of his new Netflix special, \\u201cThe Closer.\\u201d How did you feel about that?\", \"That\\u2019s my brother. My relationship with Dave is one that I value, respect and appreciate. In our profession, it\\u2019s a crab-in-a-barrel mentality. There\\u2019s this perception that there can only be one star or one funny guy, and we\\u2019re always pitted against each other. When you have that confidence and security to embrace another talent and stand by another talent, it says a lot about who you are. Chappelle\\u2019s operating at a different frequency, man, and I couldn\\u2019t be prouder of him.\", \"Were you concerned that his mention of you would reopen your old controversy, or put you in a position of having to defend Chappelle from the criticism he has received?\", \"In what world is a friend not going to be a friend if he wants to be a friend? With Dave, I think the media have an amazing way of making what they want a narrative to be. Within this conversation attached to Dave, nobody\\u2019s hearing what his attempt is. They\\u2019re hearing a narrative that\\u2019s been created. So the conversation is now amplified into something that has nothing to do with the beginning of what it was. That\\u2019s where it gets lost. Everybody needs to come down off the soapbox and get to a place of solution.\", \"But where is there a middle ground between Chappelle and people who have felt hurt by \\u201cThe Closer\\u201d?\", \"That man don\\u2019t have a hateful bone in his body. And I don\\u2019t say that because it\\u2019s hypothetical \\u2014 I say that because I know him. I know his world. I know that he embraces the LGBT+ community, because he has friends who are close to him from that community. I know that his kids understand equality, fair treatment, love. I know that his wife embeds that in their kids. I know why people embrace him. He\\u2019s a good dude.\", \"Do you agree with the argument \\u2014 as some of Chappelle\\u2019s defenders have made, and as often comes up when a comedian is criticized for insensitivity \\u2014 that anything said in the context of a joke is permissible?\", \"You can\\u2019t say that. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just a joke,\\u201d right? I understand why people would want that to be the case. But it\\u2019s not the case. If there is a joke, there\\u2019s an attempt to be funny. You can find a joke tasteful or distasteful. If you\\u2019re a supporter of a performer, then you\\u2019re probably OK with whatever\\u2019s happening. And if you\\u2019re not a fan, you\\u2019re infuriated and you\\u2019re outraged. Rightfully so \\u2014 you have every right to be. You also have a right to not support it. But the energy that\\u2019s put into wanting to change or end someone, it\\u2019s getting out of hand.\", \"Has this experience given you a new perspective on when you were criticized for your remarks?\", \"I can only relate because of what I went through. The difference in what I went through: I learned a lesson in ego. My ego blinded to me where I couldn\\u2019t see what the real thing was about. My ego had me thinking: You want me to apologize? I already did. This is 10 years ago. Why are you asking like this is me, now, when I said these things?\", \"But it wasn\\u2019t about the people that may or may not have known that I apologized. It was about the people who wanted to know that I don\\u2019t support violence in any type of way. Because I missed it, that doesn\\u2019t make me a person who hates \\u2014 that makes me oblivious to a moment because I was wrapped up in my own [expletive]. I was human. You can\\u2019t lose that. And that\\u2019s what happening today: We\\u2019re losing that in the attempt to say, \\u201cI\\u2019m right and you\\u2019re wrong and that\\u2019s it.\\u201d I don\\u2019t understand how we ever evolve.\", \"Does it feel strange that comedians should be the focus of this much attention \\u2014 that their words should carry this much weight?\", \"You can\\u2019t ignore the attention that comes with the stage that we\\u2019re on. The one thing you have to be conscious of now is that words have impact. You have a choice to make, as a person who has a platform, when you speak. If you want to say things, that\\u2019s your right. With those things you choose to speak on, there can come backlash. If you\\u2019re OK with the plus and the minus of it, then that\\u2019s your choice.\", \"I\\u2019m much more aware today than I was yesterday, and I\\u2019m conscious of the things that I say. I\\u2019m making sure that I\\u2019m on the side of understanding. That doesn\\u2019t take away my ability to be myself. It just means that in being myself, let\\u2019s just make sure we\\u2019re respectful in our approach.\"]","href_hash":"c997b4f44c8d11ecb7c26f0c2788151b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c997b4f44c8d11ecb7c26f0c2788151b"}},
