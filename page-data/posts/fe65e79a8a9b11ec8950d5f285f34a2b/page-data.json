I don\\u2019t just mean passing things around, but eating them with my hands: tearing from the same big piece of injera, or scooping the same bowl of curry with sticky rice.\", \"I\\u2019m so ready for the party vibes ahead of this Super Bowl weekend, even if it won\\u2019t involve a big communal dish. I have a vision of Kay Chun\\u2019s hot tofu sliders on my kitchen counter \\u2014 the crisp pieces of tofu dripping with spicy butter \\u2014 and everyone reaching for one, unable to talk properly because their mouths are full. Next to it, there\\u2019s a platter of Zainab Shah\\u2019s pea and potato-filled samosas and some green chutney.\", \"And we definitely need something doused in Buffalo sauce: Ali Slagle has a wonderful and very simple recipe for Buffalo cauliflower that involves the broiler \\u2014 you don\\u2019t have to bother with frying! \\u2014 and a bit of Ranch dressing made with yogurt. And these grilled Buffalo-sauced mushrooms are delicious (if you can\\u2019t grill, you can also get them crisp under the broiler, just keep a close eye because once they start to brown, they go really fast!).\", \"I love to make a menu in my head only to completely deviate from it. I might just go to the farmer\\u2019s market and see what\\u2019s good, then make something spontaneously to have with crispy chickpea pancakes. I got so into baking these recently, putting all sorts of different things on top of the olive-oil-soaked, crispy-edged base.\", \"I think it\\u2019s an ideal dish for a small gathering because you can make the pancakes ahead of time, then set them up with any topping you like: seared radicchio and cheese, a mix of roasted vegetables with salsa verde, or just a heap of aloo masala under cilantro and crushed cashews. All food can be finger food if you\\u2019re good at eating with your hands!\", \"Go to the recipe.\", \"Go to the recipe.\", \"Go to the recipe.\", \"Some good reads for you: I loved this deeply researched dive into the world of flour by the writer and baker Dayna Evans, as well as this profile from Esther Mobley of Mai Nguyen, a farmer who grows rare heirloom wheats in California (I happened to buy into her flour share last year, splitting it with a friend, and it was such a joy). Speaking of good bread, if you happen to be near Long Beach, Calif., and you haven\\u2019t visited Gusto Bread yet, what are you waiting for? Thanks for reading, and see you next week!\", \"Email us at theveggie@nytimes.com. Newsletters will be archived here.
