We\\u2019ll catch up on one of the highest-profile criminal investigations that the Manhattan district attorney\\u2019s office has ever conducted, its inquiry into Donald Trump and his family business. We\\u2019ll also look at the paragraph that started Thanksgiving as we know it.\", \"New developments suggest that the long-running criminal investigation into Donald Trump and his family business has returned to its original focus \\u2014 Trump\\u2019s statements about the value of his assets in seeking loans.\", \"If prosecutors conclude that Trump intentionally submitted false valuations to potential lenders, they could argue that he engaged in a pattern of fraud.\", \"Four of my colleagues \\u2014 Ben Protess, William K. Rashbaum, Jonah E. Bromwich and David Enrich \\u2014 write that prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney\\u2019s office have issued new subpoenas for records about Trump\\u2019s office buildings, hotels and golf courses. The prosecutors have also questioned a banker from Deutsche Bank, which lent Trump hundreds of millions of dollars over the years.\", \"And earlier this month, they told Matthew Calamari, a Trump executive who had been under scrutiny, that they did not plan to indict him in the purported tax-evasion scheme that led to charges against Trump\\u2019s company and its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg.\", \"Taken together, the developments suggest that prosecutors have moved away from those tax issues.\", \"The shift comes as the district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., prepares to leave office at the end of the year. Trump and his company have denied wrongdoing, calling the inquiry a politically motivated witch hunt by Vance, a Democrat who did not seek re-election for a fourth term.\", \"Vance originally indicated that he wanted to decide whether to bring charges against Trump. He is running out of time. It might take prosecutors months to outline their case to a grand jury.\", \"And so, after more than three years of investigating Trump, Vance may have to leave the decision to his successor, Alvin Bragg.\", \"It\\u2019s a partly sunny day in the low 50s, New York, with a mostly cloudy evening in low 40s. Expect some showers in the early morning.\", \"Suspended today (Thanksgiving Day).\", \"What would the two men who wrote the book on the first Thanksgiving say about the way we celebrate it now?\", \"They did not say much at that first gathering, 400 years ago.\", \"Michael Hattem, a co-curator of an exhibition at the New-York Historical Society that includes the book in question (above), told me that the Thanksgiving holiday was built on a paragraph deep in a book published in 1622 \\u2014 and a footnote when that passage was reprinted in the mid-19th century.\", \"How different those terse beginnings were from the Macy\\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, back at full strength this year with what my colleague Julia Jacobs called \\u201call its helium-filled pomp and corporate-branded holiday cheer.\\u201d And what would the people who attended the first Thanksgiving say about our at-home preparations? By one estimate, Americans will spend nearly $1 billion on turkey for Thanksgiving this year, $144 million more than last year, partly because the price per pound has jumped.\", \"The Thanksgiving story caught on after the Civil War, according to the historian Philip Deloria, as \\u201cAmerican mythmakers discovered that the Pilgrims, and New England as a whole, were perfectly cast as national founders: white, Protestant, democratic and blessed with an American character centered on family, work, individualism, freedom and faith.\\u201d Over the years the story was taught and retaught, even if \\u201ctoday\\u2019s teachers aim for less pageantry and a slightly more complicated history,\\u201d Deloria wrote in 2019.\", \"Hattem said the passage in the 1622 book was \\u201cnot an extensive account of what happened\\u201d at the first Thanksgiving. Edward Winslow, who with William Bradford wrote the book, \\u201cdid not attach the kind of significance to the event\\u201d that it assumed 220 years later when the Rev. Alexander Young wrote the footnote.\", \"Hattem said that Winslow, who wanted to encourage more people to leave England and settle in the American colony, was preoccupied with the alliance between the colonists and the Indigenous Wampanoag tribe led by the man he called Massasoit (actually a title, not a name, according to Deloria). The Wampanoags \\u201cweren\\u2019t just coming to help the colonists or celebrate,\\u201d Hattem said. They wanted \\u201ca political alliance that would protect them from the Narragansetts,\\u201d a tribe in Rhode Island.\", \"\\u201cWinslow leaves all of that out,\\u201d Hattem said.\", \"All this was largely forgotten until Young\\u2019s book, \\u201cChronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,\\u201d came out. \\u201cHe identifies this scene from Winslow\\u2019s journal as the quote-unquote first Thanksgiving and includes a footnote that literally says this was the first Thanksgiving,\\u201d Hattem said. In his account, Deloria wrote: \\u201cOf such half-thoughts is history made.\\u201d\", \"Sarah Hale, an influential editor who gave the world the nursery rhyme \\u201cMary Had a Little Lamb,\\u201d campaigned to make Thanksgiving a holiday. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln declared not one but two days of thanks \\u2014 the first, in August, for the Union triumph at Gettysburg, and the other on the last Thursday in November. In 1941, 200 years after Young\\u2019s book, Congress declared it a federal holiday.\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"As I entered the Columbus Circle subway station to catch the D train to Brooklyn, I noticed a man playing a keyboard and soliciting donations.\", \"He was an older man \\u2014 although probably younger than my 72 years \\u2014 and the people who were nearby did not appear to be listening to him. I moved in closer and, a pianist myself, quickly realized he was excellent.\", \"I dropped some money into his box, and when he finished the song he was playing, I told him his style reminded me of Erroll Garner.\", \"His face brightened, we bumped fists and he said Erroll Garner was his idol. He began to play a well-known Garner standard, and I said it was one of my favorite tunes to play.\", \"He paused for a moment.\", \"\\u201cDo you want to play it together?\\u201d he asked.\", \"It had been well over a year since I had played with anyone, but he made room for me, and we started a duet. Our styles clicked right away, and people in the station began to draw near and toss money into his box.\", \"With my train still not there, he asked if I knew Nina Simone\\u2019s \\u201cI Wish I Knew How it Would Feel to Be Free,\\u201d another song I love.\", \"We started in, alternating solos and building in intensity as more people gathered and made donations.\", \"As we brought it to a big conclusion, he asked my name and then introduced me to the crowd as if I were his special guest.\", \"\\u2014 Michael Esterowitz\", \"Illustrated by Agnes Lee.
