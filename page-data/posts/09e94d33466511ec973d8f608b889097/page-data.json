When brought to the popular vote, 50.3 percent of members voted yes to the agreements, with 49.7 percent voting no. Approximately 45,000 members of the IATSE members voted in the election from November 12 to 14.\", \"\\\"From start to finish, from preparation to ratification, this has been a democratic process to win the very best contracts,\\\" said IATSE International President Matthew Loeb in a statement. \\\"The vigorous debate, high turnout, and close election, indicates we have an unprecedented movement-building opportunity to educate members on our collective bargaining process and drive more participation in our union long-term.\\\"\", \"The narrow margin of votes provides a stark contrast to the union's last vote. 98% of union members voted in October to authorize a potential strike of Hollywood productions.
