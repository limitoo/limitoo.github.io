Inditex sells brands that include Zara, Massimo Dutti, Bershka and Pull & Bear.\", \"Ms. Ortega has spent the past 15 years working for her family\\u2019s company, starting as an assistant at Bershka.\", \"\\u201cI have always said that I would dedicate my life to building upon my parents\\u2019 legacy, looking to the future but learning from the past,\\u201d she said in a statement.\", \"Inditex also appointed a new chief executive, \\u00d3scar Garc\\u00eda Maceiras, a former state attorney who joined Inditex in March.

Investors were concerned that the new team of Ms. Ortega and Mr. Garc\\u00eda Maceiras lacked operational experience at a time when retailers have been struggling with the coronavirus pandemic, as well as its resulting supply bottlenecks.\", \"The share price, however, rebounded on Wednesday, gaining 4.5 percent.\", \"\\u201cThe timing is not the best,\\u201d Kepler, a brokerage, wrote in a note to investors. \\u201cWe believe that both Marta Ortega and the C.E.O. \\u00d3scar Maceiras have a lot to prove when it comes to their ability to run this big monster in the middle of the Covid crisis.\\u201d\", \"Inditex was founded by Mr. Ortega and his then-wife, Rosal\\u00eda Mera, in 1975 in Galicia, in northwestern Spain, where Inditex still makes some of its clothing. The company also produces in other parts of Europe, Asia and Africa, and has more than 6,000 stores worldwide. \"]","href_hash":"be98b84a52e711ec96814bd37e171b40"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"be98b84a52e711ec96814bd37e171b40"}},
