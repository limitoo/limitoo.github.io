However food and water are now both running low on Nomuka, and the group is likely to be taken on to Tongatapu Island.\", \"Telephone communications between the islands are still a major challenge, the government said, but some islands are using radio to communicate, and a new radio station was being established to help with communications.\", \"Ships from Australia, the UK, Japan and the US are on their way to Tonga carrying supplies and personnel, as well as a New Zealand navy ship.
