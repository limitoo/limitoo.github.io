hearing the member for Koroit would spend thousands of dollars\\u00a0a year on branch stacking by paying for other people's party memberships.\", \"The Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC) is investigating allegations of the misuse of taxpayer-funded staff in the Victorian Labor Party.\", \"Kirsten Psaila, who was an electorate officer for Ms Kairouz before she quit cabinet last year after she was accused of branch stacking, told the hearings Ms Kairouz\\u00a0transferred her $14,700 during \\\"membership renewal season\\\" in 2015.\", \"Ms Psaila said she then withdrew the cash to pay for other people's memberships, which is not illegal, but is against ALP rules.\", \"The following year, Ms Psaila said Ms Kairouz transferred her $18,300, followed by\\u00a0$1,000 in 2017.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a2d4b96c5b49d52f0a2c03241703c808\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Kirsten Psaila appeared before IBAC on Wednesday.(ABC News)</div>\", \"\\\"All of that money was for memberships, wasn't it?\\\" counsel assisting IBAC, Chris Carr SC, asked.\", \"\\\"Correct,\\\" Ms Psaila replied.\", \"\\\"It's a fair inference, isn't it, that nobody would be making that investment unless they were controlling what was happening to their votes?\\\" Mr Carr asked.\", \"\\\"Yes,\\\" Ms Psaila said.\", \"Ms Psaila admitted to the inquiry she helped fill out membership ballots while she was an electorate officer, but claims she arranged to pay the memberships of people who were experiencing financial hardship and said they would get \\\"some\\\" of the money back.\", \"\\\"Don't put it as though you were playing a minor role, you were managing that factional process, weren't you?\\\" IBAC commissioner Robert Redlich said.\", \"\\\"I'm not sure about managing,\\\" Ms Psaila replied.\", \"Ms Kairouz has always denied allegations she was involved in branch stacking.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Decade working under 'fairly notorious branch stacker'</div>\", \"Ms Psaila said former Labor powerbroker Georgie Seitz, for whom\\u00a0she worked for more than a decade, introduced her to branch stacking and agreed he was a \\\"fairly notorious branch stacker\\\".\", \"The IBAC inquiry heard Ms Psaila was charged by the ALP in the mid-2000s during a branch-stacking investigation.\", \"She was accused of forging a signature on a membership form, a claim she denies.\", \"Ms Psaila initially told the inquiry she wasn't doing anything against the rules and any factional work she had done while she was working as an electorate officer was done after hours or she made up for it.\", \"But in the months leading up to May 2018, when memberships renewals were due she said she would spend five\\u00a0to six\\u00a0hours on factional work a week, \\\"perhaps more\\\".\", \"Ms Psaila told the inquiry she would process between 300 and 400 memberships per year when she worked for Mr Seitz, but didn't question whether the memberships were genuine.\", \"She claims when Ms Kairouz was elected in 2008, the member for Koroit took over a lot of Mr Seitz' members.\", \"Mr Seitz died in 2015 at the age of 73.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Like signing a blank cheque'</div>\", \"Ms Psaila broke down in tears on the witness stand as she\\u00a0was being questioned about the sort of work she was doing in Ms Kairouz's office.\", \"The inquiry took a five-minute break while Ms Psaila regathered herself.\", \"Earlier, Ms Psaila was played a secretly recorded phone conversation where Ms Kairouz described having \\\"20 odd\\\" nomination forms for the ALP national conference which, despite being signed by members, had\\u00a0the nominee line left blank.\", \"\\\"It's a bit like signing a blank cheque \\u2026 do you recognise it's wrong?\\\" Mr Carr asked.\", \"\\\"Yes,\\\" Ms Psaila replied.\", \"Ms Psaila told the inquiry the \\\"powers that be in moderate Labor\\\" would decide who the nominee would be, including Adem Somyurek, Robin Scott and Marlene Kairouz.\", \"The inquiry heard the moderate Labor faction wanted to control the ballots for the 2018 conference, so Mr Somyurek could replace Stephen Conroy on the national executive.\", \"\\\"These people are not really people who have any genuine interest in being members of the ALP, they are just people whose memberships have been renewed, paid for and whose ballots and signatures are just collected as needed by the faction,\\\" Mr Carr said.\", \"Ms Psaila said because the members signed the forms, she believed they did want to be a member.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0316d3712d3ca566f3877fb3321e7c68\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div
