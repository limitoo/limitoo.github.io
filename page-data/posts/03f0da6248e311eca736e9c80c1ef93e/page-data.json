lightly and that Moscow needed serious security guarantees from the West.\", \"In a wide-ranging foreign policy speech, the Kremlin leader also described relations with the United States as \\\"unsatisfactory\\\" but said that Russia remained open to dialogue with Washington.\", \"Speaking to foreign policy officials in Moscow, Mr Putin\\u00a0accused NATO of being openly confrontational with Russia, and\\u00a0the West of supplying arms to Ukraine and exacerbating tensions in the region.\", \"His comments follow a build-up of Russian troops near the Ukranian border,\\u00a0which has\\u00a0raised fears of an invasion.\", \"Russia has been supporting\\u00a0a separatist insurgency inside Ukraine's East since it annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014.\", \"The US\\u00a0military has so far stopped short of describing Russia's build-up as a preparation for attack.\", \"On Wednesday, US\\u00a0Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin conceded that \\\"we're not sure exactly what Mr\\u00a0Putin is up to\\\".\", \"During a visit to the Pentagon on Thursday, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov called for global unity to prevent a new Russian \\\"escalation\\\" against Ukraine.\", \"Mr Reznikov met Mr Austin at the Pentagon and cautioned about the consequences of any Russian military moves.\", \"\\\"This possible escalation will certainly have catastrophic consequences for the whole of Europe,\\\" Mr Reznikov said, according to a Pentagon transcript of a portion of his remarks.\", \"Mr Austin, who was a four-star Army general when Russia annexed Crimea

and our desire for more transparency,\\\" Mr Austin told him, according to the Pentagon transcript.\", \"Moscow\\u00a0dismissed such rhetoric as inflammatory and complained about increasing activity in the region by NATO.\", \"The Kremlin said that, in September, NATO would overstep a Russian red line if it expanded its military infrastructure in Ukraine.\", \"Moscow has since accused Ukraine and NATO of destabilising behaviour, including in the Black Sea.\", \"In a televised speech, Mr Putin complained that Western strategic bombers carrying \\\"very serious weapons\\\" were flying within 20 kilometres\\u00a0of Russia's borders.\", \"\\\"We're constantly voicing our concerns about this, talking about red lines, but we understand our partners \\u2014\\u00a0how shall I put it mildly
