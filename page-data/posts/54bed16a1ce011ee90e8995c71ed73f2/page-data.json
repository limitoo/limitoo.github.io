The guidance would limit the ability of insurers that contract with hospitals to claim provided care was not in network and have customers pay more money. Health plans also would need to disclose facility fees that are increasingly charged to patients and can surface as an unexpected cost in a medical bill.\", \"\\\"Frankly, what they are doing is gaming the system \\u2014 this is not allowed,\\\" Tanden said.\", \"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Treasury Department also are seeking information on third-party credit cards and loans that are specifically used to pay for health care. The higher costs and interest charges can discourage people in need of treatment from seeking care.\", \"The president is expected to also highlight previous efforts to reduce health care costs, including a plan allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs and a $35 monthly price cap on insulin for people in Medicare Part B.\"]","href_hash":"54bed16a1ce011ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"54bed16a1ce011ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
