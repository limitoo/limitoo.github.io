Rattled by fears of a new wave of refugees from Afghanistan, Greece has tightened the policing of its borders.\", \"The defendants include 17 foreign nationals, some of them well-known activists such as Syrian refugee Sarah Mardini, the sister of the Olympic swimmer Yusra Mardini. The siblings captured international attention in 2015, at the peak of the migration crisis, after dragging their refugee boat to safety.\", \"Ms. Mardini and the 23 other aid workers on trial could face up to eight years in prison if found guilty on charges of espionage, forgery and the unlawful use of radio frequencies. A police investigation alleged that they monitored Greek Coast Guard radio channels and used a vehicle with fake military license plates to enter restricted access areas on Lesbos.\", \"The defendants are still under investigation over a number of suspected felonies, including human smuggling and money laundering, which could carry 20-year prison terms.\", \"Their lawyers say all of the charges are trumped up.\", \"\\u201cFrom the case file material and an investigation that lasted more than three years, essentially keeping the defendants hostage, not one piece of incriminating evidence has emerged,\\u201d said lawyer Clio Papantoleon, who represents some of the defendants.\", \"Ms. Mardini, 26, could not travel to Greece from Germany, where she was granted asylum, to defend herself. She has been barred from entering the country since her release in December 2018 from a high-security prison in the capital Athens, where she was detained for three-and-a-half months.\", \"Sean Binder, a 27-year-old German-born Irish national who was arrested on the same day as Ms. Mardini in 2018, is expected to appear in court on Thursday. He was also detained for three-and-a-half months, on the island of Chios, before being released pending his trial.\", \"\\u201cThe idea that we\\u2019re spies is preposterous,\\u201d he said by telephone on Wednesday.\", \"Mr. Binder said he had cooperated with the authorities, even calling the coast guard after spotting a migrant-smuggling vessel.\", \"\\u201cIn an ideal world, there would be no need for civil search and rescue,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut in the real world, there\\u2019s a gap, and it\\u2019s a gap into which people fall and drown.\\u201d\", \"Human rights groups say the prosecutions are absurd.\", \"\\u201cThe charges they face are farcical and should never have come to trial,\\u201d Nils Muiznieks, director of Amnesty International\\u2019s European Regional Office, said in a statement on Monday. \\u201cSarah and Sean did lifesaving humanitarian work, spotting boats in distress off Greek shores and providing those onboard with blankets, water and a warm welcome.\\u201d\", \"Migration experts say the trial on Lesbos is emblematic of a broader shift toward the criminalization of refugees and aid groups.\", \"\\u201cState authorities are progressively emboldened to take constantly harsher measures against migrants and those who help migrants,\\u201d said Fran\\u00e7ois Cr\\u00e9peau, an expert on international law and a former top United Nations official on the rights of migrants. Both official language and policies \\u201cincreasingly portray migrants and their supporters as criminals.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Muiznek, of Amnesty International, said criminalizing the activities of humanitarian groups was not only unfair but counterproductive.\", \"\\u201cStopping rescue operations doesn\\u2019t stop people from making dangerous journeys,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt simply makes those journeys more perilous.\\u201d\", \"The case against the workers has been described in a European Parliament report as \\u201ccurrently the largest case of criminalization of solidarity in Europe.\\u201d\", \"The Greek migration and justice ministries said they could not comment as the case in the courts and they have to respect the independence of the judiciary.\", \"But this is not the first time aid workers have found themselves in Greek courts. A similar trial on Lesbos in 2018 \\u2014 of Spanish and Danish workers \\u2014 led to the rescuers\\u2019 acquittal.\", \"And more trials are likely to come.\", \"More than 40 rescue workers face prosecution on charges including violating state secrets laws, according to two case files prepared by the Greek police over the past year-and-a-half.\", \"Aid workers have also been prosecuted in other European Union countries such as Italy, which faced a new migrant influx this year.\"]","href_hash":"d5501bb447d411eca9dad5a2df49e881"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d5501bb447d411eca9dad5a2df49e881"}},
