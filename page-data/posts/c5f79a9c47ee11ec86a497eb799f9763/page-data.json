Few would have argued that Osimhen, a young Nigerian striker with a vast upside, was not worth a premium price.\", \"Instead, what raised eyebrows was the valuation placed on four little known players who would be making the opposite journey to northern France: an aging second-string goalkeeper from Greece and three young players of little pedigree.\", \"Official documents show Lille banked 71.25 million euros (just over $81 million) for Osimhen, a rising star now flourishing in Italy\\u2019s top league. As for the others, a group that sold for \\u2014 on paper at least \\u2014 20.1 million euros ($23 million), there is now barely a trace. Only one, goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis, 36, has appeared in a match for Lille. The other three are all back in Italy. Two currently play in the lowest rungs of Italian soccer. One now plays semiprofessionally.\", \"A year later, no one seems able to clarify how the numbers ever added up. And that is a problem because Italian financial and soccer authorities are now asking the questions about dealings that may have broken financial rules, if not criminal law.\", \"The investigations in Italy, amid whispers of market abuse by clubs \\u2014 teams that are in some cases publicly traded companies \\u2014 are only the latest attempts to try to shine light into the dark corners of soccer\\u2019s player trading system, a $7 billion industry that has often defied regulation. What they are finding is a hall of mirrors in which lax regulation, creative accounting and even ghost clubs can distort the market, and where even insiders are often unable to answer a simple question:\", \"What is a player worth?\", \"The Italian soccer authorities have so far flagged 62 player trades across two seasons, including the one involving Napoli\\u2019s acquisition of Osimhen. But it is Juventus, by most metrics Italy\\u2019s biggest team, that faces the most scrutiny: Investigators are looking at 42 trades by the club, largely connected to movements of little known athletes from its reserves or youth teams, but also including some high-profile trades with two of Europe\\u2019s biggest teams, Barcelona and Manchester City, that have faced their own challenges meeting financial control rules.\", \"Juventus has not commented beyond telling shareholders in its most recent financial report that Consob, the Italian equivalent of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has \\u201cinitiated an inspection: of its income related to player trades.\\u201d\", \"Napoli\\u2019s owner, the film producer Aurelio De Laurentiis, said he was not concerned by the probe. \\u201cI\\u2019m not worried because I\\u2019m a warrior,\\u201d he said by phone.\", \"Among the deals under scrutiny in the Italian investigation, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times, is a swap between Juventus and City of the defenders Danilo and Jo\\u00e3o Cancelo, as well as another that allowed both teams to register gains of 10 million euros for exchanging two teenage strikers before either had made a first-team appearance.\", \"Juventus made a similar agreement with Barcelona in which two little known South American forwards switched clubs, and the authorities are also looking into a 2020 deal involving midfielders Arthur Melo and Miralem Pjanic that the clubs claimed was worth more than 130 million euros, or about $148 million. Even at the time, the deal\\u2019s main value seemed to be as an accounting exercise, rather than a sporting one.\", \"In Napoli\\u2019s case, the trade under scrutiny allowed the club to reduce some of the costs \\u2014 on paper at least \\u2014 associated with adding Osimhen, one of the most expensive arrivals in the club\\u2019s history. Like those of its domestic rivals, Napoli\\u2019s balance sheet must meet certain financial requirements set by the Italian federation and cost-control regulations related to the Champions League, European soccer\\u2019s richest club competition.\", \"By sending the four minor players to Lille as makeweights in the Osimhen deal, Napoli was able to show the 20.1 million euros as an intake of millions on its books, a practice known as plusvalenza, or capital gain, that has in recent seasons become commonplace in transfer dealings. The practice has become even more valuable during the coronavirus pandemic, when club revenues have cratered because of closed stadiums, canceled matches and economic unease. Those same forces have affected the transfer market, cutting prices and restricting movement \\u2014 making it even harder for big clubs to balance their books to keep within the rules.\", \"Paolo Boccardelli, the head of Italian soccer federation\\u2019s supervisory body, known as Covisoc, wrote to its prosecutor last month advising him to start an investigation of transfer market dealings in Italy. In the letter, reviewed by The Times, Boccardelli raised an obvious point, and one that \\u2014 privately at least \\u2014 officials for the clubs involved in the probe have been eager to point out: No one can really say what a single soccer player is worth.\", \"For years, billions of dollars were shifted around the world by soccer clubs buying and selling talent, with the market price determined by subjective calculations made by those involved.\", \"\\u201cIdentifying the fair value for the performance of a professional athlete is notoriously a difficult task and not supported by an adequate level of scientific evidence,\\u201d Boccardelli wrote in his letter. In essence, he was saying what others have said: The values that go onto club balance sheets are often fake.\", \"\\u201cWe can say in a lot of cases it is a sort of fiction,\\u201d said Pippo Russo, the author of a book about the transfer market who investigated and highlighted several curious trades involving Italian teams, including some of those now being flagged by the regulators. \\u201cThey need to do this because they need to have annual accounts in order.\\u201d\", \"Russo said that while \\u201cItaly has the copyright\\u201d on the plusvalenza system, he has seen the practice exported across the European soccer landscape, highlighting deals involving teams in Spain, France and recently Portugal, where two top division teams swapped two young players with hardly any experience, but only after valuing them at millions of euros apiece.\", \"The involvement of Consob, the Italian financial regulator, is notable then, since its interest in the dealings of Juventus, a listed company, could carry serious consequences if the club is found to have broken the law. The soccer prosecutor\\u2019s powers are limited to sporting penalties, like points deductions and in some cases even demotion.\", \"In 2018, for example, an investigation discovered Chievo Verona had for years engaged in a scheme in which it inflated the value of youth players traded with another club, Cesena. The deals, worth millions of euros in total, allowed each team to meet registration requirements to obtain licenses to play in the professional leagues.\", \"Yet while Chievo was punished, some team owners in Italy have expressed frustration that rules are often changed or not enforced to protect the most successful clubs. Last season\\u2019s champion, Inter Milan, for example, secured its first title in 11 years even though it was unable to meet its payroll. The league, citing the coronavirus pandemic, had relaxed its regulation on wage payments halfway through the season.\"]","href_hash":"c5f79a9c47ee11ec86a497eb799f9763"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c5f79a9c47ee11ec86a497eb799f9763"}},
