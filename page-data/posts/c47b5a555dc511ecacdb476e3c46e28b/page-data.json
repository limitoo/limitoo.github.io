Mr. Biden will tour some of the hardest-hit areas on his trip.\", \"In the late morning, he will take an aerial tour of Mayfield, Ky., which was devastated by the storms, and then inspect it on the ground, where he will be briefed by local officials and visit a neighborhood.\", \"In the afternoon he will tour a neighborhood in Dawson Springs, Ky., a small town that is the birthplace of the father of Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, a Democrat who will join the president on his trip. Mr. Biden will then give remarks on his administration\\u2019s response to the storms.\", \"The president has already made several similar trips since taking office in January. He has visited with victims of hurricanes and extreme storms on the Gulf Coast and in the New York area, and with victims of wildfires in the West.\", \"In each case, Mr. Biden has tried to reassure residents that the federal government was working hard to speed recovery efforts, while also offering personal comfort to people who have suffered extreme damage from the disasters.\", \"In Kentucky, Mr. Biden \\u201cwill be surveying the storm damage firsthand, making sure that we\\u2019re doing everything to deliver assistance as quickly as possible to impacted areas to support recovery efforts,\\u201d Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Tuesday.\", \"\\u201cI can tell you from traveling on some of these trips with the president in the past,\\u201d she said, \\u201coften what happens is he will ask leaders directly, \\u2018What do you need? What are you not getting? And how can we make it faster for you?\\u2019 And then he will get back in the car and he will give an assignment to a staffer and say, \\u2018Get this done.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The region hit by the storms voted largely for Mr. Biden\\u2019s opponent, former President Donald J. Trump, in the 2020 election. A reporter asked Ms. Psaki on Tuesday if Mr. Biden had prepared specifically for his visit to the conservative area.\", \"\\u201cI think the president looks at people through the tragedy they\\u2019re experiencing \\u2014 the heartache they\\u2019re feeling at the loss of life, the loss of their homes; questions many people are raising, I know, about whether they can build back from this \\u2014 this storm that\\u2019s impacted their communities,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe looks at them as human beings, not as people who have partisan affiliations.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Psaki said this week that Mr. Biden had invited the entire Kentucky congressional delegation, which is heavily Republican, to accompany him on the trip. White House officials listed only one member of that group on the official manifest for the flight to the state: Representative James Comer Jr., a Republican whose district includes Mayfield.\"]","href_hash":"c47b5a555dc511ecacdb476e3c46e28b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c47b5a555dc511ecacdb476e3c46e28b"}},
