After I'd done my shift we told the kids, and we were just all ecstatic, absolutely ecstatic.\", \"\\\"Then we sent our passports in and I think it was Monday morning I was at home and Mic comes walking in and he said 'it's official' and gave me a hug, we got the visas up on screen and it says 'indefinite'. I cried a little bit.
