The stakes remain mind-bendingly high, since at the time both the United States and the Soviet Union were rushing to develop (even more destructive) hydrogen bombs.\", \"Sheinkin begins his story in June 1953 with 13-year-old Jimmy Bozart, a Brooklyn paperboy who happens upon a piece of Soviet tradecraft, a hollow nickel containing an encrypted message. From here, cutting between multiple story lines and locations, Sheinkin presents many more riddles to be solved. The chapter title \\u201cZUGZWANG\\u201d? A connection between chess and diplomacy. Part 2\\u2019s heading, \\u201cThe Hedgehog and the Pants\\u201d? A question Nikita Khrushchev asks his defense minister \\u2014 \\u201cWhat if we throw a hedgehog down Uncle Sam\\u2019s pants?\\u201d \\u2014 that sets in motion the missile crisis.\", \"\\u201cFallout\\u201d offers young readers information rather than reassurances. On one of the infamous 13 days in October 1962, President John F. Kennedy said to his aides, \\u201cIt is insane that two men, sitting on opposite sides of the world, should be able to decide to bring an end to civilization.\\u201d Other initially mystifying features of the Cold War include the divided city of Berlin, located 110 miles away from West Germany in East Germany; Sheinkin makes clear why it was the most contested place on earth. There was also the Bay of Pigs, a U.S.-backed invasion of Cuba that was among several unsuccessful plots against Fidel Castro. Another dubious idea, spread by the government and others, was that ordinary Americans could survive a thermonuclear attack by ducking, covering or building a fallout shelter. Life magazine pointed out the upside of building such a structure: \\u201cIf war never comes, children can claim it for a hideaway, father can use it for poker games and mother can count on it as a guest room.\\u201d\", \"Both Khrushchev and Kennedy are portrayed as political animals who don\\u2019t want to appear weak. They also have a nation and families they want to protect; Sheinkin was lucky enough to interview Khrushchev\\u2019s son Sergei, an American citizen from 1999 until his death last year. Of course \\u201cFallout\\u201d features a few straight-up heroes and villains. In August 1961, when the Berlin Wall started going up, a young cyclist named Harry Seidel began tunneling under it and, at great risk to himself, helped dozens of East Berliners escape to the West. Less considerate of others are the U.S. military leaders, such as Curtis LeMay and Thomas Power, who urged a massive attack on Cuba the following October, no matter the Soviet reaction. \\u201cLook, at the end of the war,\\u201d Power said, \\u201cif there are two Americans and one Russian, we win!\\u201d\", \"In his streamlined version of the early Cold War, Sheinkin necessarily omits a lot. He also understates the hawkishness that Kennedy deployed to get elected and his brother Robert displayed during the missile crisis. But just as \\u201cBomb\\u201d leads to this book, so might \\u201cFallout\\u201d send readers to \\u201cMost Dangerous,\\u201d Sheinkin\\u2019s 2015 examination of the Vietnam War and Daniel Ellsberg. What explosive secrets will he turn to next?\"]","href_hash":"df8d5de23def11ecba5e000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"df8d5de23def11ecba5e000017025a03"}},
