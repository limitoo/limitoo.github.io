In accordance with the decision, Belarusian airline Belavia said it would halt citizens from the three countries from boarding their Istanbul-Minsk flights.\", \"The AP report noted that a buildup of migrants at the EU's border could turn into a humanitarian crisis come winter.

In all, there have been 9,087 such entries so far this year, German police said.\", \"Polish authorities said a large number of people remain just across the border in neighboring Belarus, and that Polish border guards, police and soldiers continue to rebuff attempts to enter each day.\", \"Hundreds of people, including families with children, are in makeshift camps on the Belarusian side of the border. Attempts to cross have become increasingly dangerous as Poland fortifies its side of the border and pushes people back and as temperatures drop to below freezing at night.\", \"The WHO said it sent an expert team to Lithuania to assess migrants held in reception facilities there and found that 60 percent were in need of some form of medical treatment.\", \"A Polish official said the country's ongoing conflict with Belarus' government is not expected to ease in coming days.
