Here are our picks for November.\", \"An inventive and tricky hybrid of fiction and nonfiction, the documentary \\u201cA Cop Movie\\u201d tells the mostly true story of two Mexico City police officers: a man and woman who briefly dated and were dubbed \\u201cthe love patrol\\u201d by their colleagues. The director Alonso Ruizpalacios defies expectations throughout, using dramatic recreations, surprise reversals and raw interviews to keep the audience guessing about whether this is an earnest film about the challenges of being a cop or an expos\\u00e9 of institutional corruption.\", \"Based on Nella Larsen\\u2019s 1929 novel, \\u201cPassing\\u201d stars Tessa Thompson as Irene and Ruth Negga as Clare, two Black women who were friends when they were younger and who meet again later in life. Irene is a social activist, living with her husband (Andr\\u00e9 Holland) in an upscale Harlem brownstone. Clare is passing as white, and is married to a rich, racist businessman (Alexander Skarsgard). Written and directed by Rebecca Hall \\u2014 herself biracial \\u2014 this handsome-looking black-and-white period drama examines the boundaries of race and class in early 20th century New York.\", \"This live-action remake of the popular anime series \\u201cCowboy Bebop\\u201d retains what made the original so beloved: a genre-bending story about planet-hopping bounty hunters, an eye-catching style that draws on old westerns and film noir, and a jazzy up-tempo Yoko Kanno score. John Cho stars as Spike Spiegel, who, alongside his partner Jet Black (Mustafa Shakir), chases criminals across the colonies built by the refugees of a post-apocalyptic Earth. The heroes add allies and enemies with each new adventure, in a show that mixes action, comedy and science-fiction weirdness.\", \"The \\u201cHamilton\\u201d creator and star Lin Manuel-Miranda makes his feature film-directing debut, paying homage to one of his biggest influences: the late \\u201cRent\\u201d writer and composer Jonathan Larson. In this adaptation of Larson\\u2019s lesser-known, semi-autobiographical theater piece, Andrew Garfield plays an aspiring Broadway composer named Jon, still working at a diner and waiting on his big break at the dawn of the 1990s. Miranda and the screenwriter Steven Levenson tinker a little with the stage production (which originated as a concert, before being turned into a small-scaled musical by David Auburn), turning \\u201ctick, tick \\u2026 BOOM!\\u201d into more of a straight biopic with catchy songs.\", \"Halle Berry both directs and stars in this underdog sports melodrama, about a down-and-out MMA fighter named Jackie Justice who comes out of retirement after the son she gave up for adoption shows up on her doorstep. Berry had to train hard to play an experienced, hardened athlete, and to take on this role of a woman trying to shake herself out of a fog and prove to her family and her sport that she\\u2019s still a winner. \", \"This half-hour Christmas special comes from the team at Aardman Animations, the studio behind Wallace and Gromit and Shaun the Sheep. \\u201cRobin Robin\\u201d tells the story of a small bird (voiced by Bronte Carmichael) who was raised by a family of mice, and who goes on an adventure during the holiday season where her unusual upbringing proves to be an asset. The adorable character-designs and the voice performances of Richard E. Grant (as a magpie) and Gillian Anderson (as a cat) accent what should be another of Aardman\\u2019s classy, funny, cleverly constructed family comedies.\", \"Also arriving: \\u201cThe Claus Family\\u201d (Nov. 1), \\u201cThe Harder They Fall\\u201d (Nov. 3), \\u201cThe Club\\u201d Season 1 (Nov. 5), \\u201cLove Hard\\u201d (Nov. 5), \\u201cNarcos: Mexico\\u201d Season 3 (Nov. 5), \\u201cThe Unlikely Murderer\\u201d (Nov. 5), \\u201cFather Christmas Is Back\\u201d (Nov. 7), \\u201cSwap Shop: Dash for Cash\\u201d Season 1 (Nov. 9), \\u201cGentefied\\u201d Season 2 (Nov. 10), \\u201cRed Notice\\u201d (Nov. 12), \\u201cChristmas Flow\\u201d Season 1 (Nov. 17), \\u201cTiger King\\u201d Season 2 (Nov. 17), \\u201cThe Princess Switch 3: Romancing the Star\\u201d (Nov. 18), \\u201cBlown Away: Christmas\\u201d Season 1 (Nov. 19), \\u201cWaffles + Mochi\\u2019s Holiday Feast\\u201d (Nov. 23), \\u201cA Boy Called Christmas\\u201d (Nov. 24), \\u201cTrue Story\\u201d (Nov. 24), \\u201cA Castle for Christmas\\u201d (Nov. 26), \\u201cSchool of Chocolate\\u201d Season 1 (Nov. 26), \\u201cCharlie\\u2019s Colorforms City: Snowy Stories\\u201d (Nov. 30).\", \"Sometimes written as \\u201cBo66y\\u201d \\u2014 to commemorate England\\u2019s 1966 World Cup championship \\u2014 the title of this documentary refers to Bobby Moore, the star defender and team captain whose creativity and doggedness electrified his home country. After his pro career ended, Moore struggled with money and health woes, and at times felt like a forgotten man. \\u201cBobby\\u201d is an attempt to right some of those wrongs, telling a triumphant and tragic story via thrilling vintage footage and impassioned testimonials from teammates and fans.\", \"One of TV\\u2019s most popular dramas returns, after a season three finale which saw the Montana ranching family the Duttons facing multiple threats. Will the \\u201cYellowstone\\u201d creator Taylor Sheridan actually kill off any of his leads? Probably not. (Sheridan\\u2019s central antihero, the grizzled cowboy power-broker John Dutton, is played by Kevin Costner, one of the show\\u2019s producers.) After a season which saw the Duttons beset by investment bankers, environmental activists and revenge-minded outlaws, a few bombs and machine-guns shouldn\\u2019t keep them down too long.\", \"Elle Fanning returns as Catherine II and Nicholas Hoult as Peter III in season two of the satirical dramedy \\u201cThe Great,\\u201d an \\u201coccasionally true\\u201d look back at the tumultuous marriage between a cruel Russian emperor and his ambitious, coup-minded young bride. Gillian Anderson joins the cast this season, playing Catherine\\u2019s mother, who tries to manipulate things behind the scenes as her daughter prepares to become a mother herself. Expect more of the creator Tony McNamara\\u2019s puckish mix of purposeful anachronisms and courtly intrigue.\", \" In this moody drama, the director Justin Kurzel \\u2014 best-known for \\u201cSnowtown\\u201d and \\u201cTrue History of the Kelly Gang\\u201d \\u2014 and the screenwriter Shaun Grant tell a fictionalized version of the events leading up to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. Caleb Landry Jones won a Best Actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival for his performance as the title character: a lonely and disturbed young man who lives in the Tasmanian suburbs with his parents (Judy Davis and Anthony LaPaglia), and who strikes up a fateful friendship with an eccentric heiress. The actual violence remains offscreen, as \\u201cNitram\\u201d presents an intimate portrait of a damaged soul.\", \"Also arriving: \\u201cAnimaniacs\\u201d Season 2 (Nov. 6), \\u201cShark with Steve Backshall\\u201d (Nov. 8), \\u201cFinding Jack Charlton\\u201d (Nov. 12), \\u201cThe Big Bang Theory\\u201d Seasons 1-12 (Nov. 19), \\u201cThe Mindy Project\\u201d Seasons 1-6 (Nov. 19), \\u201cTwo and a Half Men\\u201d Seasons 1-12 (Nov. 19), \\u201cPower Book II: Ghost\\u201d Season 2 (Nov. 21), \\u201cSaved By the Bell\\u201d Season 2 (Nov. 25), \\u201cTrolls: Holiday in Harmony\\u201d (Nov. 27).\", \"Benedict Cumberbatch stars in the biopic \\u201cThe Electrical Life of Louis Wain,\\u201d playing a late 19th and early 20th century artist known for his unusual illustrations of cats. Cultural historians have long debated whether Wain suffered from mental illness or a neurological disorder, or if he was just an eccentric with a gift for making felines look colorfully, whimsically odd. The writer-director Will Sharpe and his co-writer Simon Stephenson do show how Wain\\u2019s singularity sometimes made his career difficult \\u2014 but this movie is just as much about a marriage, focusing on Wain\\u2019s relationship with his beloved wife Emily (Claire Foy).\", \"This four-part documentary offers a close look at a modern small town New Jersey family, in which multiple generations support each other as they pursue their dreams. At the center of the story is Jane Noury, a transgender teenager preparing to graduate from high school and to embark on a career in modeling while attending college. The director Jonathan C. Hyde doesn\\u2019t ignore the challenges Jane faces, but this series is more about how the warmth and comfort of a loving family can be transformative.\", \"The long-awaited TV adaptation of Robert Jordan\\u2019s \\u201cThe Wheel of Time\\u201d fantasy novels begins with the simple story of a magic-wielding guardian named Moiraine (Rosamund Pike), who becomes the protector and guide for a handful of young people from a rural community. Jordan\\u2019s saga (completed after his death by his colleague Brandon Sanderson) eventually builds into a much more complex epic, but the TV version starts with a handful of characters and quickly becomes a life-or-death fight against the ancient forces of evil.\", \"In this quietly impassioned documentary, the director Eva Orner looks back at the 2019-20 \\u201cBlack Summer,\\u201d when bushfires raged across Australia, damaging over 50 million acres of land (as well as its property and residents). \\u201cBurning\\u201d charts the terrifying progression of the fire, with disturbing footage of people fleeing the devastation. But Orner also considers the root causes, directly accusing the politicians who have refused to take any action to protect against climate change. The film is heartbreaking but not devoid of hope, as Orner talks to the activists and young people determined to take action.\", \"Also arriving: \\u201cTampa Baes\\u201d (Nov. 5), \\u201cMayor Pete\\u201d (Nov. 12), \\u201cEveryone Loves Natti\\u201d (Nov. 19).\"]","href_hash":"a8988f323dd611ec830c000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a8988f323dd611ec830c000017025a03"}},
