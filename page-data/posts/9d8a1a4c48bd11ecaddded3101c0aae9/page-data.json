The Seattle-based companies opened their first Starbucks Pickup with Amazon Go location on Thursday in New York, with at least two more New York stores planned for next year.\", \"The new cashierless location in midtown Manhattan comes amid an uneven economic recovery including a shortage of workers at many restaurants and retailers as a direct result of the pandemic.\", \"The store, on East 59th Street between Park and Lexington avenues, offers the full Starbucks menu as well as prepared salads, sandwiches and snacks from Amazon Go.
