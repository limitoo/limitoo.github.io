For most of his life, he was an agnostic; faith for him was \\u201cinfinitely unattainable.\\u201d But attain it he did, late in life, and in 1975 he wrote, \\u201cThe coming of Jesus into the world is the most stupendous event in human history.\\u201d\", \"Twenty centuries after his birth, Jesus still holds a revered place in the hearts of billions of people. I am among them. I imagine that it has influenced almost every area of my life, like food coloring dropped in water.\", \"Among the things that have long fascinated people about Jesus and explain his enduring appeal is his method of dialogue and teaching. He asked a lot of questions and told a lot of stories in the form of parables. In fact, parables form about a third of Jesus\\u2019 recorded teachings. The Gospels were written decades after he died, so his questions and parables clearly left a deep impression on those who bore testimony to him.\", \"Martin Copenhaver, a retired president of Andover Newton Theological School, claims in his book \\u201cJesus Is the Question\\u201d that Jesus was more than 40 times as likely to ask a question as answer one directly, and he was 20 times as likely to offer an indirect answer as a direct one. \\u201cOh my soul, be prepared for the coming of the Stranger,\\u201d T.S. Eliot wrote in \\u201cThe Rock.\\u201d \\u201cBe prepared for him who knows how to ask questions.\\u201d\", \"Some of Jesus\\u2019 questions were rhetorical; others were meant to challenge or even provoke. In some cases, Jesus used questions to parry attacks by religious authorities who set traps for him. In others, he used questions to enter more fully into the lives of others and to help people look at the state of their hearts. He asked people about their fears and their faith. Jesus used questions to free a woman caught in adultery from condemnation and to inquire whether people considered him to be the Messiah. He probed deeply into questions not many had asked before him, like \\u201cFor what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\\u201d\", \"Jesus liked to turn the tables on his interlocutors, especially those who were in the business of asking questions themselves. In Luke, an expert in the law asked Jesus, \\u201cTeacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\\u201d His reply took the form of not one question but two: \\u201cWhat is written in the law?\\u201d and \\u201cHow do you read it?\\u201d But that\\u2019s hardly the end of the exchange. We\\u2019re told that this person wanted to justify himself; Jesus moved the conversation to a very different plane, from the abstract to the personal. When the lawyer asked, \\u201cWho is my neighbor?\\u201d Jesus asked what it meant to him to be a good neighbor. By the end of this cross-examination, Jesus had led his interlocutor \\u2014 first through his questioning and then via the parable of the good Samaritan \\u2014 to acknowledge that the person who is a good neighbor is the one who shows mercy. It is an astonishing interaction.\", \"As for his use of parables, in \\u201cJesus Through Middle Eastern Eyes\\u201d the theologian Kenneth Bailey wrote, Jesus \\u201ccreated meaning like a dramatist and a poet rather than like a philosopher.\\u201d The author refers to Jesus as a \\u201cmetaphorical theologian\\u201d whose \\u201cprimary method of creating meaning was through metaphor, simile, parable and dramatic action rather than through logic and reasoning.\\u201d\", \"Jesus, when asked by his disciples in Matthew 13 why he spoke in parables, indicated that it was to reveal the truth to some and to hide the truth from others. He was willing to disclose the truth to those who were sincere but wanted to conceal it from people not willing to honestly wrestle with its meaning. Jesus also clearly understood the power of stories to make his words more memorable by making them more personal.\", \"\\u201cArguments may form our opinions, but stories form our loves,\\u201d Cherie Harder, the president of the Trinity Forum, told me. She added, \\u201cStories ask us to enter another world \\u2014 which usually has the result of broadening or disrupting our own.\\u201d\", \"Jesus\\u2019 parables provide layers of meaning: There is enough richness and ambiguity in them that people could spend a lifetime reading them and taking different things from them. Bobby Gross of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship told me, \\u201cParables and questions invite us \\u2014 require us \\u2014 to think, to ponder.\\u201d\", \"With his puzzles and paradoxes, Jesus is trusting our discernment, knowing that the Bible includes contrasting approaches on matters ranging from why people suffer to keeping the Sabbath to how we should treat our enemies. As the theologian Kenton Sparks put it, \\u201cAt face value, Scripture does not seem to furnish us with one divine theology; it gives us numerous theologies.\\u201d\", \"I wonder, too, if Jesus, in telling parables, might have had in mind what Emily Dickinson described when she wrote, \\u201cTell all the Truth but tell it slant/Success in Circuit lies.\\u201d So much more so when she closes her poem by saying, \\u201cThe Truth must dazzle gradually/Or every man be blind.\\u201d\", \"Kerry Dearborn, a professor emerita of theology at Seattle Pacific, told me that in terms of the ways in which Jesus communicated, \\u201cI\\u2019m convinced he used questions and stories as a means of connection and transformation \\u2014 to awaken us, to whet our appetites, to invite us to draw nearer, that we might open up more fully to God and to God\\u2019s purposes in and for us.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWith his use of everyday elements of life, people felt seen,\\u201d Ms. Dearborn added. \\u201cWith his powerful depictions of a father who loves prodigals, tax collectors and Samaritans, people were comforted and felt safe enough to follow him. And hearing stories of the ways in which God stands on the side of the oppressed, people would know they could trust this God of both justice and love.\\u201d\", \"Philip Yancey, the author, most recently, of the memoir \\u201cWhere the Light Fell,\\u201d said that \\u201cthe aspect of Jesus\\u2019 style that stands out to me is how unpropagandistic he was. Imagine: He knew the truth more than anyone who has lived and could have responded with dogma and fiat, as the church so often has done in his place. Instead, he was anything but an arm twister.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Yancey went on to point out in so many places, Jesus makes it impossible for us to conclude, \\u201cI\\u2019m OK. I can relax.\\u201d Whether it\\u2019s Jesus\\u2019 teachings on anger or lust or his command that we be perfect as his father in heaven is perfect, \\u201cno one can reach that place of spiritual superiority that Jesus holds out, which was his point, exactly. We don\\u2019t earn God\\u2019s grace; we receive it.\\u201d\", \"William Fullilove, a pastor at McLean Presbyterian Church, where I worship, put it to me this way: \\u201cJesus was after our hearts, not just our minds. He was after lives changed, not just intellects grown.\\u201d\", \"Jesus used stories, then, but he was also part of a story, one that contains thousands of characters and unexpected twists and turns, different genres (poetry, prophecy, epistles, wisdom literature) and countless subplots. But the Bible is also, above all, a metanarrative \\u2014 the unfolding of a story God has entered, most conspicuously in the person of Jesus, a drama that has purpose and direction. That has been, at least for some of us, a source of comfort, especially in moments of grief and great pain.\", \"Kate Bowler, an associate professor at Duke Divinity School who was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer at the age of 35, told me, \\u201cJesus\\u2019 tender birth and violent death leave the problem of suffering unanswered until the end of days. We must learn to live and die in the not-yetness of suffering and empire, fear and uncertainty. But our questioning hearts in the face of evil is not an affront to faith. Jesus simply says: Wait. All will be revealed.\\u201d\", \"Mark Labberton, the president of Fuller Theological Seminary, explained to me that trauma is like broken glass \\u2014 shards in our lives that can randomly and repeatedly cut us inside. The trauma needs to be named and gradually integrated into a person\\u2019s life, and if possible, for those who are able, it helps for the trauma to be put in the context of being part of a larger story. For some people, that larger story need not have a faith component; they are able to create meaning without it. But for others, having their trauma understood not as a random, awful event but rather as a very difficult chapter in a larger and ultimately redemptive story can be life-giving.\", \"Christmas is meaningful, for those of us of the Christian faith, because it situates each of our lives \\u2014 the joys and the sorrows, the hope and the despair, the dramatic and the mundane \\u2014 in a larger narrative: Not only did God author it; the son of God became a protagonist within it.\"]","href_hash":"156d0e3a63d911ec97bb51174ddc13c2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"156d0e3a63d911ec97bb51174ddc13c2"}},
