I'm homeless. I don't have a place to live.\\\" I said I didn't have a place to live before I came here [cries].\", \"Michelle Miller: And you're thinking, \\\"What am I going to do?\\\" Was it fear, desperation at your wit's end or all of that wrapped up into one?\", \"Katrina Brownlee: Yeah, I mean \\u2026 Now I'm really all alone. I really am rock bottom. I'm at the lowest place that I think a human being could be in at that point \\u2026 Your son is murdered. You can't take care of your children. You have nowhere to live.

And \\u2026 I started from the wheelchair, then I went to the walker and then I went to a cane and then I started to walk. So that was a process.\", \"Katrina devoted her entire being to showing the doctors she could get better.\\u00a0 \", \"Michelle Miller: So, what were the things they said you couldn't do?\", \"Katrina Brownlee: I wasn't going to walk again. \\u2026 I wasn't going to have a normal life again.\", \"Michelle Miller: So, you went \\u2014    \\u00a0check.\", \"Katrina Brownlee: Right. It was like check ...\", \"Michelle Miller: Check, check.\", \"Katrina Brownlee: Check, check, check, check, check (laughs).\", \"She also checked off another box: self-esteem.\", \"Katrina Brownlee: I started to believe in myself. I started to build up \\u2026 who I was as a person. \", \"But the fates weren't done with Katrina Cooke Brownlee. She was about to be tested yet again. \", \"There were many stops along the way that could have derailed Katrina Cooke Brownlee's journey out of darkness.

I don't know how much homeless you could be, but then I really became homeless.\", \"Katrina \\u2014     who by then had her two girls back \\u2014     ended up in a homeless shelter on the Lower East Side of New York.\", \"Katrina Brownlee: Rats were there, roaches was there. \\u2026 It was really, really bad here.

Keri discovered that Alex Irvin \\u2013 against court orders \\u2014 had been calling and threatening Katrina from jail.\", \"Keri Herzog: I wanted to rain down on him with the white-hot intensity of a thousand suns. The arrogance for him to be having this conversation with her from inside the jail was outrageous \\u2026 he needs to pay.\", \"But then the defense presented a letter to the judge purportedly written by Katrina herself.\\u00a0 \", \"Keri Herzog (reading the letter): \\\"I, Katrina Cooke, the victim in this case, has decided that I don't want to press charges due to duress at the time of my accident.\\\" \\u2026 This is a woman who had been shot 10 times and here she's portraying it as an accident.\", \"Keri Herzog (reading the letter): And then the icing on the cake, \\\"If I am subpoenaed to court, I will testify on the defendant's behalf.\\\"\", \"Keri Herzog: I was horrified.

In fact, I'm going to disappear and you're never going to find me.\\\" \\u2026 Rage was starting to build up inside of me. \\u2026 I let out this bellow and said, \\\"Katrina, I will hunt you down like a dog if I have to.\\\" \", \"Keri Herzog: And then she hung up on me.\", \"Despite issuing a subpoena, Keri didn't expect Katrina to appear in court. But even without her star witness, Keri believed she would win a conviction.\", \"In April 1994 \\u2013 one year and three months after the attack \\u2013 jury selection began.
