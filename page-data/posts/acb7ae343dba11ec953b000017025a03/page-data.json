Earlier this year, conversations ramped up surrounding reproductive health as Texas implemented the most restrictive abortion law in the U.S.\", \"Reproductive health can refer to all matters having to do with the reproductive system. In Ireland, one woman is claiming a doctor denied her a hysterectomy despite \\\"debilitating period pain\\\" that she has been experiencing since she was a child.\", \"The reason? She said the doctor did not want to consider a hysterectomy in case the woman's \\\"sexual orientation changes.\\\"\", \"\\\"Can't believe that today a gynaecologist [sic] told me that a hysterectomy wouldn't be considered as an option for my debilitating period pain on the off chance that I divorce my wife, my sexual orientation changes, I meet a man and decide I want children,\\\" the woman, whose username is @RachChamp_, wrote on Twitter\", \"A hysterectomy is typically a procedure to remove the uterus, according to the Mayo Clinic, but a \\\"total hysterectomy\\\" would refer to both the uterus and cervix being removed. In some cases, the ovaries and fallopian tubes might be removed as well.\", \"The post has now been retweeted over 35,000 times and has been flooded with responses of similar experiences.\", \"\\\"Yep I was told this to,\\\" one person responded. \\\"I already had 3 kids and I was single and they said what if you meet someone who wants kids? I responded we can adopt but why does an imaginary man have more say over my body than I do?\\\"\", \"Another wrote, \\\"\\u200b\\u200bI can't even get my OB Gyn to put me on the implant so the extremely painful periods stop. Her objection? What if I suddenly meet a man and suddenly decide I want babies right [f**king] now and I have to go through the hassle of taking it out of my arm.\\\"\", \"User @RachChamp_ followed up the post by adding that she is 27 years old and has experienced severe pain associated with her period since she was 10 years old.\", \"\\\"I've had two surgeries [1 with ovarian drilling], tried three different contraceptive pills, the mirena [sic] coil, and have tried every combination of painkillers. Nothing has helped,\\\" she wrote.\", \"One commenter tagged Dr. Jennifer Gunter in the post who is an OBGYN that has become outspoken on social media about all issues pertaining to reproductive health. She is the author of the books The Menopause Manifesto and The Vagina Bible.\", \"\\\"I think of [sic] someone is offered all the options and understands the benefits and risks they should get to choose the one[s] that they want,\\\" Gunter wrote. \\\"So NSAIDs, TENS, hormonal medications, hormonal IUD, ablation, and hysterectomy.\\\"\", \"Actress Lena Dunham spoke openly about her decision to get a hysterectomy at 31 after a years-long struggle with chronic pain and endometriosis, she wrote for Vogue in 2018.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926614/gynecological-chair.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A woman on Twitter claimed her doctor would not consider a hysterectomy in the event her \\\"sexual orientation changes.\\\" Here, a stock photo shows a typical gynecological chair.</div>\", \"On the flip side, hysterectomies have also been over-performed. As recently as last year, forced- sterilization was reported to be occurring at the U.S. border, according to CNN and in Virginia, a doctor was found to be performing hysterectomies at his discretion for insurance fees, Women's Health reported, also in 2020.\", \"In the most recent update to her post, @RachChamp_ emphasized that her doctor did not give any medical reason for denying the procedure.\", \"\\\"Important to mention that he did not give me any medical reason why I could not have a hysterectomy. He told me it isn't an option because I'm too young, the pain I'm in is clouding my judgement [sic] and my life circumstances may change,\\\" she wrote. \\\"No medical reason why it's not an option.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"acb7ae343dba11ec953b000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"acb7ae343dba11ec953b000017025a03"}},
