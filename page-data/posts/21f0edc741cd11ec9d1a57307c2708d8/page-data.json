Attendees entered through a back alley lit by yellow lanterns, past graffitied walls covered in posters of superheroes. Inside they sipped Champagne while Asian drag queens, West Dakota, Panthera Lush and Dynasty, writhed around the restaurant\\u2019s poles. The evening\\u2019s invitation had dictated: \\u201cDress to Slay.\\u201d\", \"That was not because guests were about to get bloody, however. They were celebrating the birth of a new kind of superhero.\", \"Forget Shang-Chi. Forget the Eternals. The most unexpected supe debut is happening this week online, courtesy of House of Slay, a web comic book series about five Asian best friends who fight the God of Darkness. And who also happen to be real.\", \"Or at least are based on real people. Fashion people, to be exact.\", \"They include the designers Prabal Gurung and Phillip Lim, plus Laura Kim of Oscar de la Renta. Also the influencer Tina Leung and Ezra J. William, a restaurateur and socialite.\", \"Friends who met through their work but found themselves drawn more closely together by the Asian hate crimes that proliferated during the coronavirus pandemic, the quintet formed a casual support group \\u2014 they nicknamed themselves the Slaysians \\u2014 that grew into a broader movement on social media. Now it has become the base of a pop culture fable meant to reach anyone who feels like an outsider, whether they care about fashion or not. Together the animated gang fights an evil overlord whose power grows with every episode of racial discrimination. Love and understanding must prevail to create a world safe for all.\", \"\\u201cThere are so many kids, especially Asians, that feel othered or who don\\u2019t fit in,\\u201d Mr. Lim said. \\u201cShowing these kids that real people like us can become superheroes is so important.\\u201d\", \"At a time when everyone from the British royal family to Barack Obama has been turned into a toon, and high-profile celebrities vie to become part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it was only a matter of time before fashion \\u2014 an industry that is, after all, not unaware of trend \\u2014 and comics collided.\", \"\\u201cThey are both super visual mediums,\\u201d said Alex Lu, the editor who worked on House of Slay. \\u201cThey both deliver social commentary in a way that is challenging and exciting.\\u201d\", \"The Slaysians originally came together largely by accident. Ms. Kim and Mr. Gurung had worked in the same building for 10 years and started bumping into each other \\u2014 as well as the rest of the gang \\u2014 at fashion events. Those chance meetings became nights out at Bubble T, a queer Asian dance party, and dinner parties.\", \"\\u201cThe first time Phillip invited us over for dinner, I only said yes because I wanted to see his apartment,\\u201d Ms. Kim said, laughing. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t think I had time for friends.\\u201d\", \"During the pandemic, Mr. Lim and Ms. Kim sent homemade kimchi and pho to the others via messenger. They met daily for walks on the West Side Highway or grocery trips to Sunrise Mart, the Japanese grocery store. \\u201cWe made sure we were six feet apart and had gloves on,\\u201d Ms. Leung said. \\u201cRemember when we all wore gloves?\\u201d\", \"When the Black Lives Matter protests happened, they went together to the front lines. \\u201cGrowing up, I was taught not to speak up,\\u201d Mr. William said. \\u201cBut Prabal and Phillip taught me how to be more vocal.\\u201d When the Asian hate crimes were rampant, they shared one another\\u2019s fears. (\\u201cMy 78-year-old mother lives in my building, and she goes for walks every morning,\\u201d Mr. Gurung said. \\u201cI was so worried about her I bought her a blonde wig to wear.\\u201d) And they used their social media followings to help spread the hashtag #StopAsianHate and to raise money.\", \"When they started posting photos of themselves, together with the hashtag #Slaysians (a term coined by the music artist Slayrizz, who also performed at the House of Slay opening party), they were flooded with hundreds, some days thousands, of comments, direct messages and emails saying how much they loved seeing this friendship. So they did it more often.\", \"\\u201cWe come from an industry where you are made into competitors,\\u201d Mr. Lim said. \\u201cThe narrative is always, there is only room for one of you or two of you. We realized we could change that by showing us together. A photo of us five was a show of force. It says, \\u2018We are Asians, and we slay.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The group had begun discussing whether they should capitalize on their popularity by introducing a product (Slaysian hot sauce?) when Michael Chow, a friend of Mr. Lim and a media entrepreneur and investor, reached out, asking if they would be interested in turning their lives into a comic series.\", \"\\u201cOne day he took me out to dinner and said, \\u2018What is this Slaysian thing about?\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Lim said. \\u201cHe said we are missing BIPOC narratives in the media world. He convinced me that we could help raise awareness on stories and issues and celebrations in the BIPOC community.\\u201d\", \"House of Slay was born.\", \"It took a year to create the comic series, which has been masterminded by Einhorn\\u2019s Epic Productions, a company focused on creating comic series for \\u201cunderserved fandoms.\\u201d Every Wednesday at 6:30 p.m., there was a Zoom meeting with the production team to brainstorm narratives about the book. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t miss a single one,\\u201d Mr. Gurung said.\", \"The Slaysians received homework, including questionnaires they had to fill out about their upbringing, their fears, their experiences and their dreams to determine which super power would be most fitting. Not to mention which outfit.\", \"After all, the five friends had strong opinions from the start about what their superheroes should wear.\", \"Mr. William, for example, wanted something blue for his character. It\\u2019s his favorite color, he said, \\u201cand all the superheroes I loved growing up, like Sailor Moon and Storm, had a lot of blue.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Leung\\u2019s representative ended up in a gold armor bodysuit with a chain-mail cape and gold high heels. \\u201cI feel like such a boss and so powerful when I wear a suit, so that\\u2019s my go-to outfit,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI wanted my whole body to be made of gold and diamonds, but they said it wouldn\\u2019t show up in the comic, so now I just have a little bit of diamond crystal heel.\\u201d\", \"As for Ms. Kim, she said: \\u201cInitially I wanted to wear a beige trench coat with black leggings because I am always realistic in the way I approach things.\\u201d The response? \\u201cThat\\u2019s too normal, and I have to be more superhero. Now I have a white trench coat with a latex material that is translucent.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Lim said he wears a green and gold robe \\u201cbecause in a past life I had, I felt like I had a connection to monasteries or was a monk and engaged in a life of service.\\u201d But for those moments when his character is feeling a little less serene, one of his arms is also covered in dragon-shaped armor.\", \"Finally, there\\u2019s Mr. Gurung\\u2019s supe, who wears jewelry from Nepal (Mr. Gurung is Nepali), black leather and a black cape that changes color to match his powers. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what this project is all about,\\u201d he said: \\u201cThere is power in color.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe five also spent a long time talking to Jeremy Holt, the comic book author, so the writer could get to know their personalities. \\u201cThe way we speak together in the comic, it\\u2019s exactly how we talk in real life,\\u201d Ms. Leung said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how we were captured so well.\\u201d Much of what the superheroes go through is inspired by the friends\\u2019 real life experiences.\", \"For example, the story begins as our heroes are viewing Asian antiquities at a gallery where, unbeknown to them, a villain is raiding the gallery to steal a rare and powerful artifact that grants him powers of darkness. Later that evening, the good guys discover its opposite: an artifact that grants them powers of light, which they use to fight against hate and intolerance.\", \"Mr. Gurung received the power of telepathy and the ability to control other people\\u2019s emotions. Mr. Lim is bulletproof. Ms. Kim gets to teleport (\\u201cI hate at the end of the night when I\\u2019m tired and I have to wait for an Uber,\\u201d she said). Ms. Leung can telekinetically move objects, and Mr. William has the ability to control the weather. The battles between good and evil don\\u2019t occur in grimy back alleys or on the sides of skyscrapers, but at the city\\u2019s most exclusive and fashionable sites (names have been changed for the alternate comics-verse).\", \"In one episode they all attend the Met Gala \\u2014 or rather, its House of Slay stand-in. \\u201cI\\u2019ve never gone in real life, but at least the superhero me gets to go,\\u201d Mr. William said.\", \"The digital book is free to read on the comics platform tapas, and the 48-page book will be released weekly, in chapters. Movies, television shows and music may also follow. And House of Slay merchandise \\u2014 baseball hats, T-shirts and food products \\u2014 is in the works.\", \"\\u201cThe fact that I am a real life person who is now a superhero is hilarious, but also really cool,\\u201d Mr. Lim said. \\u201cI am still coming to terms with it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"21f0edc741cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"21f0edc741cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
