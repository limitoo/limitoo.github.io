She was turned away.\", \"However, she got it there on Thursday - the pharmacy even having a sign out front advertising their availability to give booster vaccinations. It was taken down by the time she returned to try take a photo of it for RNZ.\", \"A vaccination staff member from the pharmacy told RNZ they had been giving people booster shots but had \\\"basically run out of stock\\\", which was \\\"absolutely\\\" the result of people coming in for Covid-19 boosters.\", \"They said it was frustrating there has been \\\"so much\\\" conflicting information since the government's Tuesday announcement about both the rollout starting in January but also the ability to start now.\", \"Ben Latty from Wellworks Pharmacy in Wellington, agreed, earlier telling Morning Report he had been fielding dozens of phone calls from people wanting their booster dose.\"]","href_hash":"6199bedc63d611ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6199bedc63d611ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
