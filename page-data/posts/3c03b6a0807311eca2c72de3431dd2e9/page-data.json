But every so often I crave modesty, and the writer-director David Beton\\u2019s \\u201cConfession\\u201d perfectly fits the bill. It takes place in a single location, a Massachusetts church, where Victor Strong (Stephen Moyer), a mysterious gunman with a bullet wound in his abdomen, takes a priest hostage.\", \"The dialogue-heavy film moves like an elongated confession: Both Victor and the priest, Father Peter (Colm Meaney), are broken, widowed parents estranged from their children. While Father Peter mines information from Victor \\u2014 who is this mysterious man? \\u2014 a similarly wounded cop named Willow (Clare-Hope Ashitey) hides in a church closet for the ideal moment to strike. For the meat-and-potatoes gunfights, the cinematographer Andrew Rodger relies on wide shots and foreboding blue lighting to imbue them with a melancholic edge. Never fussy, \\u201cConfession\\u201d feels like a tiny action miracle.\", \"I love a grim western, especially the kind that interrogates the genre\\u2019s archetypes: \\u201cUnforgiven,\\u201d \\u201cThe Wild Bunch,\\u201d \\u201cThe Homesman\\u201d and so forth. The director Tim Sutton\\u2019s \\u201cLast Son,\\u201d a grisly, unrepentantly violent tale, aims for more moderate goals, but moves with a similar vigor.\", \"Borrowing a Shakespearean conceit, Greg Johnson\\u2019s script begins with the legend of Isaac LeMay (Sam Worthington), a ruthless gunman hired by the Army to clear the plains of their Indigenous tribes. He caroused with women wherever he went, leaving offspring in nearly every town. A Cheyenne chief\\u2019s prophecy \\u2014 one of the outlaw\\u2019s children will murder him \\u2014 causes him to scour the countryside to eliminate his kin.\", \"Coldblooded racist killers like LeMay are slowly fading from the western landscape, and so are the people who come to kill him: bounty hunters, his bank robbing son Cal (Machine Gun Kelly) and his quiet daughter Megan (Emily Marie Palmer), a subversion of the genre. When these disparate characters intersect, the enlivening final showdown between them, which involves a Gatling gun, is a bloody, wonderful mess.\", \"In the not-too-distant future, the last few human survivors living on a decimated earth are intent on fighting an invading alien species until their last breaths. \\u201cOccupation: Rainfall,\\u201d the writer-director Luke Sparke\\u2019s sequel to his film \\u201cOccupation,\\u201d takes place two years post-invasion. Some of the aliens, such as Garry (Lawrence Makoare), have risked everything by banding together with their human enemies to defend the planet. But the earthlings don\\u2019t just distrust their interstellar comrades, they also despise them.\", \"These tensions color the lead characters: Amelia (Jet Tranter), an alien ally, butts heads with the genocidal Wing Commander Hayes (Daniel Gillies). Garry goes on a mission with a distrustful soldier (Dan Ewing) to discover the origins of the weapon their extraterrestrial foes have code named Rainfall. Sparke\\u2019s action flick includes references to \\u201cStarship Troopers,\\u201d \\u201cCrimson Tide\\u201d and \\u201cIndependence Day,\\u201d and features large, epic set pieces. The opening battle, worth the watch in itself, is set in a fiery, ravaged Sydney, and sees aerial dog fights, chaotic gun battles and a killer comet.\", \"Another spare entry, the writer-director Derek Presley\\u2019s period gangster film, \\u201cRed Stone,\\u201d possesses a surprisingly tender spirit. It features a familiar crime opening: A delinquent teenager, Motley Adams (Dash Melrose), witnesses his brother Danny (Dominic Scott Kay) being murdered by a ruthless crime boss, Jed Haywood (Michael Cudlitz). After finding a precious ruby his brother hid, the titular red stone, Motley goes on the run to evade the F.B.I. and the goons sent by Jed to kill him.\", \"To pad out \\u201cRed Stone,\\u201d Presley thankfully adds a fascinating wrinkle in Boon (Neal McDonough), a grieving hit man employed by Jed. Boon, who dresses all in black, recently lost four family members in a freak accident. Before the day is out, he needs to attend their funeral, transfer his grandmother to a less expensive home and find Motley before the feds do. The climax might be the ruminative Boon, armed with a lone pistol, succumbing to a crisis of conscience and single-handedly battling a ranch full of bandits. But it\\u2019s the final shot, an exhausted Boon laying across four graves as the sun kisses his cheek, that breaks the heart.\", \"Kyusha (Ksenia Alexeeva), an orphan, desperately pines for a family. She thinks she\\u2019s found one when the failed fairy tale writer Andrei (Pavel Trubiner) and his wife, Olga (Marina Kazankova), adopt her from a bleak orphanage run by Andrei\\u2019s former wicked flame (Lyubov Tolkalina). Kyusha\\u2019s foster father tells her of a legend. In St. Petersburg, Russia, is a clock tower built by a czar. It was once run by Pekko, the time guardian, with a warning: If the clock stops, the city will plunge into darkness. Pekko dutifully wound the clock until his daughter died, leading his wife to madness and causing him to leave forever. Now only his heir, armed with his key, can break the darkness.\", \"A frightful adventure, the director Alexey Telnov\\u2019s film borrows heavily from the Brothers Grimm and Lemony Snicket as Kyusha teams with a washed-up magician to save the dark city and her family from the clutches of an evil witch. \\u201cThe Time Guardians,\\u201d particularly in the way it shows Kyusha\\u2019s strength in the face of tragedy, provides a sensitive way for children to engage with difficult issues.\"]","href_hash":"3c03b6a0807311eca2c72de3431dd2e9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3c03b6a0807311eca2c72de3431dd2e9"}},
