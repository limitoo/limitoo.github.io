Mr. Cox had long been the prime suspect in the cold case, prosecutors said. His execution by lethal injection was Mississippi\\u2019s first in nearly a decade.\", \"\\u201cAll that he said was that he was sorry for taking my mom away and that her death was senseless, and that he should have never harmed her,\\u201d Amber Miskelly, Ms. Cox\\u2019s daughter, said in an interview on Tuesday.\", \"Ms. Miskelly, 32, said that she received a letter on Monday from Mr. Cox\\u2019s lawyers expressing remorse for her mother\\u2019s killing. \", \"\\u201cI felt relieved, but it upset me all over again,\\u201d Ms. Miskelly, who lives in Ripley, Miss., said.\", \"Mr. Weddle said in an interview on Tuesday that Mr. Cox had not said how he had killed his sister-in-law, but that investigators would begin searching for her remains. They were expected to enlist the help of anthropologists and archaeologists from Mississippi State University, he said.\", \"\\u201cHe was the last person to see her alive back in 2007, but, of course, he never confessed to anything,\\u201d Mr. Weddle said. \\u201cHaving something to take to a grand jury back then would have been almost impossible.\\u201d\", \"\", \"In May 2010, Mr. Cox fatally shot his estranged wife, Kim Kirk Cox, 40, who had separated from him, while she had been staying at a sister\\u2019s home in Union County, Miss., according to court records. As his estranged wife lay there dying, Mr. Cox repeatedly sexually assaulted his stepdaughter, who was 12 at the time, the authorities said. \", \"In 2012, Mr. Cox pleaded guilty to one count of capital murder, three counts of sexual battery, two counts of kidnapping, one count of burglary and one count of firing into a dwelling during the confrontation, which led to an hourslong standoff with police. \", \"A jury sentenced him to death later that year, but his execution was delayed as he mounted appeals. Mr. Cox abandoned those appeals in 2018. This fall, the Mississippi Supreme Court found that Mr. Cox was mentally competent when he waived his rights to an appeal.\", \"In a statement on Monday, Mississippi\\u2019s Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel, which represented Mr. Cox, said of his confession to killing Felecia Cox, \\u201cMr. Cox felt deep remorse and wanted to bring closure to her family.\\u201d The office declined to comment further on Tuesday.\", \"\"]","href_hash":"add4784857ae11eca99481975d20300d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"add4784857ae11eca99481975d20300d"}},
