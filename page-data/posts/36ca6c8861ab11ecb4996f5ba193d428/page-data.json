But because he missed most of the second half of the 2021 tennis season because of a chronic problem with his left foot, he played only 29 matches this season.\", \"His positive test, announced Monday, casts doubt on whether he will return to the circuit next month for the Australian Open, the first Grand Slam tournament of the year.\", \"\\u201cI am having some unpleasant moments but am counting on feeling better bit by bit,\\u201d he said in a post on Twitter in Spanish on Monday. He added: \\u201cAs a consequence of the situation, I have to maintain total flexibility with my schedule, and I will analyze my options depending on how my situation evolves.\\u201d\", \"Nadal said he had taken a P.C.R. test after returning to Spain from Abu Dhabi and was now confined to his home in Manacor on the Spanish island of Majorca. He said he had informed all those with whom he had been in close contact about his test result, including his wife Maribel, his father Sebasti\\u00e1n, his fitness trainer Rafael Maym\\u00f3 and two of Nadal\\u2019s coaches: Carlos Moy\\u00e0 and Marc L\\u00f3pez, according to El Pa\\u00eds, a Spanish newspaper.\", \"The list of close contacts also presumably included Nadal\\u2019s two opponents in the Abu Dhabi exhibition: Andy Murray and Denis Shapovalov, both of whom defeated Nadal.\", \"Juan Carlos, the former king of Spain, attended Nadal\\u2019s match with Murray on Friday and met on Saturday with Nadal and Moy\\u00e0, according to the Spanish newspaper El Mundo.\", \"Nadal is the latest tennis star to contract the coronavirus. No. 1 Novak Djokovic tested positive for it in 2020. No. 2 Daniil Medvedev did so earlier this year, as did Aryna Sabalenka, No. 2 in the women\\u2019s singles rankings, and Coco Gauff, the rising American teenager who was unvaccinated at the time and was forced to miss the Summer Olympics.\", \"Unlike Djokovic, who has not revealed his vaccination status, Nadal has been an advocate for vaccination and said he would comply with the upcoming Australian Open\\u2019s decision to require players to be vaccinated.\", \"\\u201cIf the people who really know about it say that we need to be vaccinated, who am I to create a different opinion?\\u201d he said in Abu Dhabi last week.\", \"Nadal ranked 6th after his abbreviated 2021 season, had to withdraw from Wimbledon, the Summer Olympics and the United States Open this year because of M\\u00fcller-Weiss syndrome, a congenital foot condition that first troubled him in his teens but which he has long been able to manage with custom insoles and therapy.\"]","href_hash":"36ca6c8861ab11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"36ca6c8861ab11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
