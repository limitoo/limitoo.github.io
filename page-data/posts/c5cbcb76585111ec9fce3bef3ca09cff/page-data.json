city served as an unofficial landmark for the East Midlands region and powered millions of homes for many years.\", \"But the local industry fell into decline in the 1980s and now the UK is just years away from its 2024 target of abandoning coal-generated power.\", \"The city is now undergoing a major identity transformation, with the local council putting forward a 270-point plant to achieve carbon neutrality by 2028.\", \"If it works, Nottingham will be one of the first cities in the world to achieve this, and many are convinced it will.\", \"\\\"I've seen it change a lot over the
