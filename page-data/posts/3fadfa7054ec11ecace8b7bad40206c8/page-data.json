Instead, they are idioms that appear in the annual data-driven marketing campaign known as Spotify Wrapped.\", \"The feature, which was released on Dec. 1, shows users of the streaming music service the songs and artists they listened to most throughout the year. Its arrival reliably inspires a number of screenshots and memes on social media. In 2020, for example, people posted about how fittingly depressing (or soothing) some of their most-listened-to tracks were.\", \"This time, much of the commentary revolved around the campaign\\u2019s use of internet slang (\\u201cliving rent-free in my head,\\u201d \\u201cvibe check,\\u201d \\u201cmain character\\u201d) and its references to popular topics (NFTs, skin care regimens). In one meme, a Twitter user joked about personal finance using the tone of the Spotify campaign: \\u201cYour checking account balance was in the bottom .003%.

Others found something resembling self-knowledge in the \\u201caura\\u201d readings that Spotify generated based on the moods suggested by their music tastes. (One person on Twitter jokingly reported that Spotify had deemed their audio aura as being \\u201cfertile and breedable.\\u201d)\", \"After the feature\\u2019s Dec. 1 release, the hashtag #SpotifyWrapped trended for a couple of days, and the memes have been endless. In short, Spotify has collected a lot of data and is now reaping the benefits.\", \"Kelsey McGarry, 28, who lives in Los Angeles and works as a grant writer and coordinator for the city\\u2019s homeless services, spent practically a whole day poring over her own Spotify Wrapped. She said that the results felt like an accurate read of who she is.\", \"\\u201cMy Spotify Wrapped is very gay,\\u201d said Ms. McGarry, who added that her top artist of the year was Charlie XCX. She enjoyed looking back at her year in music but noted that the language in this year\\u2019s Wrapped was occasionally distracting.\", \"\\u201cMy skin care routine isn\\u2019t even long,\\u201d Ms. McGarry said. \\u201cLike, what are you talking about?\\u201d\", \"Rajat Suresh, a 26-year-old comedian and writer, was one of the many people online who joked about Spotify leaning into playful language and buzzwords.\", \"\\u201cIn 2021, you were not cancelled,\\u201d Mr. Suresh wrote in a meme he posted on Twitter. \\u201cBye Felicia!

So you\\u2019ll notice playful references to cultural trends from 2021 reflected in the interactive user experience.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Suresh said that he uses Spotify a lot, making it \\u201cone of the companies that knows everything\\u201d about him. For him, though, this year\\u2019s roundup reached a little too far.\", \"\\u201cIt just felt like a classic Twitter thing of when the brand is trying to seem like a human or something,\\u201d he said in a phone interview from his home in Brooklyn, noting that he\\u2019d rather just see the data.\", \"That\\u2019s not to say he didn\\u2019t check his Spotify Wrapped with genuine curiosity.
