She hoisted up bigger and brighter Christmas trees, one year even partnering with Netflix as a sponsor.\", \"Mr. Gualtieri has spent his first weeks in office trying to distinguish himself from Ms. Raggi, who was, rightly or wrongly, blamed for a host of the city\\u2019s ills. He has shown a can-do spirit in a city known as being eternal, a reference \\u2014 some snidely suggest \\u2014 to the amount of time it takes to do anything here.\", \"He promised that, by Christmas, he would clean up the city\\u2019s streets and remove the mounds of garbage that periodically smother Roman trash bins. (Empirical evidence suggests that he has so far missed this mark.)\", \"And last week, he announced that a landmark bridge that had burned down shortly before the elections on Oct. 4 \\u2014 a metaphor of Rome burning that was not lost on Ms. Raggi\\u2019s critics \\u2014 would reopen on Sunday.\", \"But the city has gone to town on the tree.\", \"Compared with Spelacchio, the 2021 tree is taller \\u2014 75 feet to Mangy\\u2019s 72 \\u2014 and it is considerably fuller and much brighter. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very luminous,\\u201d said Francesco Bernardi, who is training to be a lawyer in Rome. He gave the tree a thumbs up, but questioned the city\\u2019s decision to \\u201cuse so much energy to light\\u201d it, given the global concern with \\u201cgoing green.\\u201d\", \"He need not have worried: All of the bulbs on the tree are energy-efficient LEDs, a spokesman for the energy utility Acea said.\", \"Apart from the glittering lights \\u2014 and there are plenty of those \\u2014 for his first tree, Mr. Gualtieri has joined with the United Nations\\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization, which is based in Rome, to reflect a different Christmas spirit.\", \"The tree, the mayor said, is \\u201cpart of an awareness-raising campaign about the United Nations\\u2019 sustainable development goals,\\u201d ambitious targets aimed at improving lives and covering areas like world hunger, climate change, the environment, education and justice.\", \"\\u201cThere is no better moment or place than the Christmas tree to present these extraordinary objectives and enrich the message of Christmas,\\u201d Mr. Gualtieri said.\", \"Seventeen festively wrapped boxes, each representing a goal, are arranged around the tree. And each one is marked with a QR code that people can scan to read about how to make Rome more sustainable. (Advice to fulfill Goal No. 12: \\u201cSupport brands that are socially responsible and ethical, donate old clothes to charity and buy secondhand.\\u201d)\", \"To illustrate the sustainable development goals around Rome, Acea installed light-covered wire Christmas trees atop colorful stands in 14 neighborhoods.\", \"These are \\u201ca road map for how each of us can take simple actions to be part of the change,\\u201d Qu Dongyu, the director general of the Food and Agriculture Organization, said in a statement. He invited everyone to \\u201clearn more about the sustainable actions that each of us can do in our daily life.\\u201d\", \"Enrico Giovannini, Italy\\u2019s minister of sustainable infrastructure and mobility, who was also at the tree lighting ceremony news conference on Wednesday, said the European Union and Italy had put the goals \\u201cat the center\\u201d of the continent\\u2019s economic recovery amid the coronavirus pandemic. \\u201cThe goals have come down to policies,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a great initiative,\\u201d said Simona Marcolli, who had come to see the tree with her preteen daughter, adding: \\u201cWe already speak of these issues at home. It\\u2019s important.\\u201d\", \"And the tree? \\u201cIt\\u2019s great,\\u201d she said.\", \"Romans have also been keeping an eye this year on a crosstown rival \\u2014 the Vatican \\u2014 after a Nativity scene last year that they excoriated as being too untraditional.\", \"This year, the Nativity scene was a gift from the Chopcca Nation, in Peru. It displays 35 life-size figurines dressed in typical Andean costumes. \\u201cIt\\u2019s more classic, more traditional,\\u201d said Angela Schinnea, a tour guide in Rome.\", \"Her friend Marisa Maiorana, who works for an import-export company, said she liked the Vatican Christmas tree \\u2014 a 92-foot, eight-ton red fir from northern Italy. But she said she appreciated the Piazza Venezia tree as well, though she noted that Romans had begun to call it \\u201cbottiglione\\u201d because they joked that it resembled an oversize bottle.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s true\\u201d that Romans complain about everything, said Simone Livulpi, who just graduated from college with a communications degree.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a way of being,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe tend to be whiny about everything.
