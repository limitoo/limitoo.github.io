One in five Venezuelans has fled the country under Mr. Maduro\\u2019s rule, and 95 percent of those who remain don\\u2019t earn enough to meet basic needs, according to a study by the country\\u2019s main universities.\", \"The ruling party\\u2019s sweep was greatly aided by the divisions within the opposition. Some opposition leaders boycotted the vote, as most of them did in other recent elections. Those who chose to participate divided votes with factions that had made pacts with Mr. Maduro or adopted a softer line against the president to take advantage of the economic liberalization that he has allowed in recent years.\", \"The European Union observation mission said Tuesday that it could not call Sunday\\u2019s vote free or fair, in part because of the unfair advantages enjoyed by the ruling party, and the lack of rule of law.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s a political situation that\\u2019s together with the grave socioeconomic situation has provoked the exodus of millions of Venezuelans,\\u201d Jordi Ca\\u00f1as, the representative of the European Parliament with the observer mission, said on Tuesday at a news conference in the capital, Caracas.\", \"The mission, however, highlighted several democratic improvements in Sunday\\u2019s elections, going as far as to call the country\\u2019s electronic vote processing system \\u201creliable.\\u201d\", \"The United States, which does not recognize Mr. Maduro\\u2019s government, called the election deeply flawed, but commended the opposition candidates who decided to participate to keep the few democratic offices they still held.\", \"At polling places in Caracas on Sunday, many voters expressed little confidence in the fairness of the election, but said they had decided to show up anyway, in some cases because they viewed their vote as their last tool in a fight for change.\", \"\\u201cI know the whole process is controlled,\\u201d said Blas Roa, 55, a carpenter in Caracas, who voted for the first time since 2015. \\u201cBut if I don\\u2019t vote, I\\u2019m not doing anything.\\u201d\", \"Most Venezuelans didn\\u2019t bother.\", \"Only 42 percent of voters cast ballots, the lowest turnout in any election in which the opposition had participated in the last two decades. After 20 years of Socialist rule, few in the country still nurture hopes of radical change, focusing instead on taking advantage of the new economic freedoms to improve their precarious livelihoods.\", \"That government-induced apathy ended up being Mr. Maduro\\u2019s biggest weapon in the elections, said the opposition leader Freddy Superlano, who ran for governor in the ranching state of Barinas, once a major Socialist Party bastion and home of the party\\u2019s founder, Hugo Ch\\u00e1vez.\", \"That contest remained too close to call Tuesday afternoon. \", \"The outcome would have been different, Mr. Superlano said, if opposition factions had put aside their misgivings and mounted a concerted campaign.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re fighting not against the candidate, but against all the power of the state,\\u201d he said by telephone from Barinas.\"]","href_hash":"0d8c034a4ca711ecb07d2f3e3fbd6282"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0d8c034a4ca711ecb07d2f3e3fbd6282"}},
