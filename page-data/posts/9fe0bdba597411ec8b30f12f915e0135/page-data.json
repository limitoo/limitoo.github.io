It is unclear if the surge will be a relatively minor event or a return to the dark days of earlier pandemic waves.\", \"Omicron appears to be the most contagious form of the virus yet, and more able to evade immunity from previous infections or from vaccines. Though it also seems to cause less severe illness than earlier variants, experts warn that a huge surge in cases could nonetheless overwhelm hospitals and cause a spike in deaths.\", \"On Wednesday, Britain introduced new restrictions, including mask mandates and requiring vaccine passports, and urged people to work from home where possible. It was a striking reversal for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who had previously opposed the stricter controls that have been adopted around Europe.\", \"Quotable: \\u201cI think we are looking at a horrible winter,\\u201d said Peter English, a retired consultant in communicable disease control, noting the exponential spread of Omicron.\", \"By the numbers: With just 817 Omicron cases in Britain confirmed yesterday, the figure is small compared with the daily average of 48,000 new coronavirus cases overall. But health officials warned that if the recent growth rate continues, Omicron cases could make up at least 50 percent of all cases in a few weeks.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"Ukrainian generals say that if Russia were to invade, they would need military help from the West to fight off the attack. Intelligence services say there is no indication that the Kremlin has made up its mind whether to invade.\", \"New tanks, armored vehicles and ships have been delivered to frontline Ukrainian units fighting Russian forces and Kremlin-backed separatists. But that would not be enough to repel the full-on Russian assault that Ukrainian and Western officials fear Moscow might be preparing.\", \"Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, dismissed concerns about the troop buildup on the border during a video call with President Biden on Tuesday, and he shifted blame to the U.S. and NATO for supporting Ukraine. Biden has ruled out sending U.S. forces to Ukraine to deter Russia. He held a call with Ukraine\\u2019s president on Thursday.\", \"Details: U.S. intelligence officials have found that Russia has devised plans for an offensive involving 175,000 troops. Ukraine has only slightly more troops in its entire military. It is outgunned on land, at sea and in the air.\", \"Since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman became the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia more than four years ago, Saudi women have had more choices regarding employment, which public spaces they may access and even the color of their abayas, traditional Muslim women\\u2019s gowns.\", \"The changes are part of Prince Mohammed\\u2019s broad modernization plan, called Vision 2030, which is meant to wean the kingdom away from its historical reliance on oil and shift it toward new industries, including technology, pharmaceuticals and tourism.\", \"But progress has been uneven. The ongoing guardianship system means that women must get permission from men \\u2014 often their fathers or husbands, but sometimes their sons \\u2014 to marry and make key decisions. Women\\u2019s attire is still far from liberal. And, overall, the culture remains deeply conservative.\", \"In Pittsburgh, Memphis and Los Angeles, huge billboards proclaim, \\u201cBirds Aren\\u2019t Real.\\u201d On Instagram, YouTube and TikTok, Birds Aren\\u2019t Real accounts have garnered hundreds of thousands of followers.\", \"The Gen Z-fueled conspiracy theory posits that birds don\\u2019t exist and that they are really drone replicas installed by the U.S. government to spy on Americans. But what is it really about?\", \"The onslaught of best-of lists in December can be overwhelming. Consider this a guide to the guides.\", \"For music nerds, Pitchfork unveiled its annual list of best songs. It pairs well with The Times\\u2019s wide-ranging picks for best albums of the year \\u2014 or our own take on the best songs. Each of our pop music critics made lists, and two albums overlapped on all of them: Tyler, the Creator\\u2019s \\u201cCall Me if You Get Lost\\u201d and \\u201cSour\\u201d from Olivia Rodrigo.\", \"Perhaps you prefer jazz or classical music? We picked the best of each, including the classical composer of the year (Kaija Saariaho, from Finland).\", \"In the Book Review\\u2019s list of the 10 best fiction and nonfiction titles, there are ruminations on race in America and generation-spanning sagas. And you\\u2019ll also find our recommendations on the top art books, science fiction and fantasy tales and mystery novels of 2021.\", \"We also collated the best TV. Many of our critics\\u2019 picks covered subjects like class conflict and pandemics. A personal favorite: \\u201cReservation Dogs,\\u201d a meandering, occasionally surreal comedy about four teens desperate to escape their Oklahoma reservation. It\\u2019s full of the kinds of details \\u201cthat can only come from loving the thing you want to leave,\\u201d our critic James Poniewozik writes.\", \"Find all of The Times\\u2019s best-of-2021 lists here.\", \"No matter what fish or seafood you use, this bold, briny stew is a winner.\", \"\\u201cSex and the City\\u201d returns in the form of \\u201cAnd Just Like That.\\u201d Our critic has this review.\", \"These generation-spanning albums, including seasonal releases from Nat King Cole and Kelly Clarkson, redefine holiday classics.\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: Talk, talk, talk, talk \\u2026 (three letters).\", \"And here is the Spelling Bee.\", \"You can find all our puzzles here.\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing.

Readers wrote in to share tips and tricks for playing Spelling Bee, one of our most popular games.\", \"The latest episode of \\u201cThe Daily\\u201d is about a Times investigation into a website that shares advice on how to die by suicide.\", \"You can reach Natasha and the team at briefing@nytimes.com.\"]","href_hash":"9fe0bdba597411ec8b30f12f915e0135"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9fe0bdba597411ec8b30f12f915e0135"}},
