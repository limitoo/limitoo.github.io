Catfishing designates the act of deceiving online by pretending to be someone you are not.\", \"Campbell explained in the video that she was actually not wearing makeup in the photo in question, and compared her real-time face to the image\\u2014displaying no difference.\", \"\\\"When I went to go learn more about the man of my dreams, he only wrote that he was 6'1. Six one? Wow, so tall,\\\" she said, showing his profile's description to simply read his height.\", \"Campbell took it upon herself to discover which one of the pair was really the catfish. Using the average sizing of a coffee cup, which Will is holding in one of his photos, she scaled it against his body and calculated how tall it makes him in comparison.\", \"She then did the same with a pair of sunglasses he had hanging from the neck of his shirt in another photo\\u2014and came to the same conclusion that Will appeared to be 5'10\\\" instead of 6'1\\\", according to Campbell's calculations.\", \"\\\"Height doesn't matter btw, but lying and being rude does,\\\" she captioned the video.\", \"Of course, using an iPhone ruler and average sizing to dictate someone's height through images can only go so far, so it's perfectly plausible neither parties are Tinder \\\"catfishes\\\" in this situation.\", \"Campbell later confirmed in a comment that \\\"approximately 10 hours after posting this, our dear William unmatched me.
