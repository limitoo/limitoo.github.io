A Los Angeles judge terminated the arrangement on Friday, giving the pop star control over her health, estate and finance for the first time in more than 13 years. \", \"\\\"What an amazing weekend...

After her release, the court made the conservatorship permanent, giving her father and another co-conservator power over her finances and medical decisions.\", \"Britney broke her silence on the conservatorship over the summer, calling the arrangement \\\"abusive,\\\" and claiming members of the conservatorship had complete control of her life. \", \"\\\"I don't think I can live a full life,\\\" Britney said in June. \\\"I feel ganged up on, I feel bullied and I feel alone. I shouldn't be in a conservatorship if I can work and provide money and work for myself and pay other people.
