Nearly three quarters are boosted. And many of the remaining six percent of unvaccinated people will have been infected recently.\", \"\\\"At a certain point,\\\" Prof Baker said, \\\"we're going to have both a highly vaccinated population, and half the country maybe having been infected with the Omicron variant and have a lot of what you call 'natural immunity' from that.

It'll also enable us to move on from vaccine passes, and ease mandates in places where they are less likely to impact on vulnerable people.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/139960/four_col_140322NZHMMPOSTCAB18.jpg?1647234322\\\" alt=\\\"- POOL - Photo by Mark Mitchell.
