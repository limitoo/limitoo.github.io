Once an anti-vaccine stronghold, Marin County has become an unlikely champion of Covid-19 shots. Also, should social justice be part of California\\u2019s math curriculum? \", \"The pocket of California that has emerged as a leader in Covid-19 vaccinations may come as a surprise.\", \"Seventy-eight percent of people living in Marin County are fully vaccinated against Covid \\u2014 the highest rate of any county in California (and just about anywhere in the nation).\", \"But Marin County, a wealthy enclave across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, has historically been a hotbed for anti-vaccine sentiment, a place where many have long shunned routine immunizations.\", \"There are a few possible explanations for the apparent change of heart: The coronavirus pandemic has made the need for vaccinations very real while shifting the politics around getting shots. And anti-vaccine reputation aside, Marin County fits the profile of a highly vaccinated place: rich, college-educated and liberal.\", \"But perhaps more important, Covid-19 vaccinations thus far have mostly been limited to adults, with resistance to vaccines long focused on possible effects on young children \\u2014 for whom Covid-19 vaccines became available only this week.\", \"\\u201cWhat we think of as anti-vaxxers \\u2014 and historically in Marin \\u2014 is very much rooted in childhood vaccinations,\\u201d Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, told me. \\u201cI think you\\u2019re already seeing some people balking at the idea that they need to vaccinate their children, even if they themselves are vaccinated.\\u201d\", \"Marin County officials say they hope to administer first doses to 75 percent of 5- to 11-year-olds, the newest group eligible for a coronavirus vaccine, by early December. But many see that as an overly ambitious target, especially in Marin.\", \"Dr. Christopher Longhurst, a pediatrician who worked at Stanford for many years, remembers treating children from nearby Marin County who came in infected with measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.\", \"Longhurst told me about a 6-week-old in the intensive care unit who was admitted with whooping cough, a disease for which the infant was too young to be vaccinated.\", \"The baby lived in a part of Marin County where, because of low childhood vaccination levels, \\u201cherd immunity had evaporated,\\u201d he said. The infection killed the child.\", \"\\u201cLong before Covid, I\\u2019ve been a very big vaccine advocate,\\u201d he said.\", \"In Marin County in May, an unvaccinated teacher spread the coronavirus to half the students in a classroom. And this week, the county became the first in the Bay Area to lift its indoor mask mandate, a move some criticized given a recent plateau in Covid-19 cases.\", \"But Marin County has mainly played the part of Covid-cautious county. Even when Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a statewide Covid-19 vaccine requirement for students, the strictest in the nation, there was little pushback.\", \"At a recent protest in Sacramento against the mandate, families from the Bay Area, and specifically Marin County, were largely absent.\", \"\\u201cWe still have pockets of very vocal vaccine refusers,\\u201d the county health officer, Dr. Matt Willis, told The San Francisco Chronicle, but \\u201cit\\u2019s clear the community culture has shifted.\\u201d\", \"For years, resistance to childhood vaccinations was something embraced by left-leaning, hippiesh types. But opposing Covid-19 vaccines is associated with President Donald J. Trump, an unlikely stance in Marin County, where 82 percent of voters cast ballots for President Biden in 2020.\", \"Still, things often become more complicated when children get involved. Already, Covid-19 vaccination rates for 12- to 17-year-olds in California are lower than for older age groups: 60 percent compared with 71 percent for 18- to 49-year-olds.\", \"The rates may drop even lower for the latest group to become eligible for a shot, given that parents tend to be particularly protective over younger children.\", \"Though Covid-19 has become a leading cause of death among children, some parents may be more hesitant to vaccinate children because their risk of severe illness is far below that of adults.\", \"In a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey, 27 percent of parents nationwide said they wanted to immediately vaccinate their 5- to 11-year-olds. Thirty percent said they would definitely not get them their shots.\", \"\\u201cI am interested in seeing whether the enthusiasm and the wholesale uptake of vaccinations that we\\u2019ve seen in some areas\\u201d will translate into vaccinations for children, Bibbins-Domingo told me. \\u201cI think people are anticipating we\\u2019re not going to get the high rates we see in adults.\\u201d\", \"For more:\", \"Should social justice be part of California\\u2019s math curriculum?\", \"Creamy butternut squash pasta with sage and walnuts.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes from Monica Vincent, who recommends Nevada City, which is about 60 miles northeast of Sacramento:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.
