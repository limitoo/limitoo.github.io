Its latest addition is on the Upper East Side, opening Friday, in the space that was occupied by Maison Kayser on Third Avenue, with an airy, open floor plan and the baking in full view. Opening just before Thanksgiving, with several new items for the holiday like sweet potato rolls and a lemon ricotta pie, this new Breads will also be selling its pecan tart, savory squash tart and harvest babka (made with roasted sweet potatoes, onions and cheese).
