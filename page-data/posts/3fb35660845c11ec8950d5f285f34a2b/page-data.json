Reliable  statistics on the number of app workers aren't available, but estimates  put the number at tens of thousands \\u2014 many of them lured into the  industry by the flexibility of schedules, the need to supplement income, or out of a lack of other options.\", \"But for most, delivering is a full-time job, according to a survey last year from Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations and the advocacy group Los Deliveristas Unidos. The report found that two-thirds of delivery drivers work at least six days a week and average just over $12 an hour, including tips \\u2014 well below New York City's minimum wage.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We  are delivery workers or Uber drivers. We're moving the city. ... They  want good food, and we deliver it to their door,\\\" said Ranjit Geuli, a  member of the United Delivery Workers Association and a driver for Uber  and Uber Eats for five years.\", \"\\\"We  have no protection. ... Our jobs are unsecured,\\\" said Geuli, an  immigrant from Nepal, who called for a union at a rally near City Hall.  \\\"If we all come together, it will be a big voice.\\\"\", \"Most  of the coalition's members are based in New York City, but it  also  represents members in parts of neighboring regions. The coalition  hopes  its advocacy will ripple into movements across the country.\", \"The  ride-sharing industry was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic but remains  a multibillion-dollar industry. At the same time, apps like DoorDash  and UberEats have flourished as diners shunned restaurants in favor of  home delivery. The food delivery business generates more than $150  billion worldwide, according to an analysis by McKinsey & Co.\", \"Those numbers have riled advocates who say workers aren't getting their fair share.\", \"\\\"App  workers run New York City. Without app workers, New York City would be  at a complete standstill,\\\" said Aeraj Kazi, a driver advocate. \\\"Justice  for App Workers is about finally being able to step up against these big  dogs.\\\"\", \"The  coalition, which includes the NYC Rideshare Club, United Delivery  Workers Association and seven other groups, said many of its members  struggle to pay rent, keep up with car payments and provide for their  families.\", \"Immigrants  like Peng Fei Zhang, who must support a family of five,  say they have  little choice but to take delivery jobs because their  poor command of  English makes it more difficult to land other jobs.\", \"In  a statement, the ride-sharing company Lyft said it was willing to work  with its drivers \\\"to strengthen app-based work, prioritizing earnings,  safety and protecting the independence and flexibility drivers want.\\\" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has previously called for app companies to pay some workers' benefits. \", \"Two years ago, Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and other delivery companies backed a successful effort in California to exempt themselves from paying minimum wage and overtime. After the proposition passed, Khosrowshahi said he intends to push for similar laws in other states.\", \"Last  month, some new protections for workers went into effect in New York City, among  them the right to use restrooms at restaurants for whom they are  delivering food. \", \"The online firms that employ them must also reveal how  much customers tip and must tell workers how much they earned on a daily  basis.\", \"Until  the new law, food delivery workers were at the mercy of restaurant  owners who didn't always grant them permission to use their facilities.  Some resorted to carrying bottles in which to urinate, said Dachuan Nie,  the president of the International Alliance of Delivery Workers, who  himself continues to deliver food to earn a living.\", \"The  coalition said it is focused on advocating for living wages, better  safety, quality health care, reliable bathroom access, the right to form  a union, and protections against being unfairly blocked from receiving  work.\", \"CBS News' Irina Ivanova contributed reporting.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"3fb35660845c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3fb35660845c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
