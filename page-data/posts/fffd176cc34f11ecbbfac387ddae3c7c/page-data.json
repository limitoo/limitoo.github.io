Imperialism as it is.\\\"\", \"Russia says it is conducting a \\\"special military operation\\\" to demilitarise Ukraine and liberate its population from dangerous nationalists. Ukraine and its Western allies call Russia's 24 February invasion an unjustified war of aggression.\", \"Moldova's foreign ministry said it had summoned Moscow's ambassador on Friday to express \\\"deep concern\\\" about the general's comments.
