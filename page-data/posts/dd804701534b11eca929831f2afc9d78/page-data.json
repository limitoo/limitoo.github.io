found guilty of dangerous conduct, but not guilty of firing gunshots.\\u00a0\", \"The pair were both given\\u00a0fully suspended\\u00a0sentences of 20 months\\u00a0and had their firearm licences\\u00a0disqualified\\u00a0for five years.\", \"The charges relate to an incident on the Carpentaria Highway near Borroloola in August last year.\", \"Lawyers for Benjamin Wright, 32, and Jayden Harmes, 20, told the court the pair pursued\\u00a0a\\u00a0family in a high-speed chase because they thought a female passenger in the car was in distress and a possible victim of domestic violence.\", \"A Darwin Local Court\\u00a0judge accepted the pair had formed that belief but said their actions in response were not justified and there was not enough evidence to support their view\\u00a0that a woman was at risk.\\u00a0\", \"In a two-day hearing\\u00a0earlier this year, the court heard the men drove after the family's car after it left a roadhouse near Borroloola.\", \"Prosecutors said the chase reached speeds of up to 160 kilometres per hour, with the men using flashing high-beam headlights as they pursued the car along a\\u00a0strip of\\u00a0single-lane highway.\", \"In the February hearing, witnesses who were in the car being chased\\u00a0\\u2014 who are from an Aboriginal family in Borroloola \\u2014 told the court they feared for their lives.\", \"They\\u00a0said they saw\\u00a0a\\u00a0man in the Land Cruiser pursuing them holding a gun, and heard a gunshot.\", \"<img

in a threatening way, she could not say for sure if a shot\\u00a0was\\u00a0fired near the family's car, or at all.\", \"\\\"Despite accepting that all of the prosecution witnesses were honest, reliable and truthful, I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that [the firearm] was discharged,\\\"\\u00a0she said.\", \"\\\"I find it was quite likely that it could have been discharged, just can't be satisfied if it actually was.\\\"\", \"Both men were found guilty of two counts of recklessly endangering serious harm, and not guilty of discharging a firearm to frighten, endanger or annoy.\", \"Wright was also charged with possessing an unsafe firearm and was found not\\u00a0guilty of that offence.\", \"<img

Maley\\u00a0told the court the allegations had stigmatised his client, who initially lost his job as a result of the charges, because of a misperception that the incident was\\u00a0racially motivated.\", \"\\\"There's not one sense of a racial overtone, he was truly motivated by a mistaken belief and [hearing] a scream, and they had intended to help,\\\" Mr Maley told the court.\", \"Judge Austin agreed with Mr Maley that there was no proven racial motivation to the offending.\", \"She told the court the pair had not actually seen the victim or any of the family prior to the pursuit, so could not have known that they were Aboriginal.\", \"Lawyers for Harmes and Wright told the court they had no criminal history and should be spared a jail sentence.\\u00a0\", \"Both were

employment.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"dd804701534b11eca929831f2afc9d78"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dd804701534b11eca929831f2afc9d78"}},
