Even after adjustments were made to control for differences between the groups, women with Covid were 1.9 times as likely as healthy women to have a stillbirth.\", \"The risk of stillbirth has been even higher for women with Covid since the Delta variant has been dominant: while the risk of stillbirth for women with Covid was 1.5 times as high as that of healthy women before July, when Delta became dominant, it was 4 times as high between July and September. As many as 2.7 percent of deliveries to women with Covid were stillbirths during the period studied while Delta was dominant.\", \"\\u201cThere had been reports suggesting an increased risk, but stillbirths are hard to study, because luckily they are uncommon,\\u201d said Dr. Denise Jamieson, chief of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory Healthcare. \\u201cThis is some of the strongest evidence of the increased risk, and probably the strongest data pointing to the risks specifically tied to Delta.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe take home message is the importance of vaccination for pregnant women, particularly at this point in the pandemic with Delta circulating,\\u201d she said.\", \"The CDC strongly encourages pregnant and breastfeeding women and women planning or trying to become pregnant to be vaccinated against Covid, but resistance has been strong, even though pregnancy is on the C.D.C.\\u2019s list of health conditions that increase the risk of severe disease.\", \"Studies have shown that pregnant patients who are symptomatic are more than twice as likely as other symptomatic patients to require admission to intensive care or interventions like mechanical ventilation, and they may be more likely to die. They are also more likely to experience a preterm birth.\", \"Another CDC study issued Wednesday described the cases of 15 pregnant women in Mississippi who died of Covid during their pregnancy or shortly afterward, including six who died before the Delta variant became dominant and nine who died between July and October, while Delta was dominant.\", \"Of the women who died, nine were Black women, three were white women and three were Hispanic women. The median age was 30. Fourteen of the women had underlying medical conditions, and none were vaccinated. Five of the deaths occurred before vaccinations were available.\", \"The study concluded that the risk of death for a pregnant woman with Covid is nine deaths per 1,000 infections, while the risk of death from Covid for other women of reproductive age is only 2.5 deaths per 1,000 infections.\", \"A third study by CDC researchers found that pregnant women with Covid faced a more than 60 percent higher risk of being admitted to intensive care, needing a ventilator or special equipment to breathe, and even of dying during the period that Delta was dominant, compared to pregnant women during the period before the variant was dominant.\"]","href_hash":"a1d34366498611eca163f352ae504a98"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a1d34366498611eca163f352ae504a98"}},
