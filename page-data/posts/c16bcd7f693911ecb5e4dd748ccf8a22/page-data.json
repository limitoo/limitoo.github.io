wait to adopt\\u00a0new national close contact guidelines.\", \"Premier Mark McGowan said the latest case was a 27-year-old male backpacker who was unvaccinated.\", \"He said the man had shared a bathroom with another positive case in the Perth outbreak sparked by another backpacker.\", \"Mr McGowan said he had been infectious while in the community, with a number of businesses in Perth's south now listed as exposure sites.\", \"The man was transferred to hotel quarantine this morning.\", \"About 720 close contacts have so far been identified in the outbreak, but 40 are yet to be tested.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d51f35ec4c61dd960a4d8a7952ab8455\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The Perth Mess Hall has been linked to a number of COVID infections in WA's latest outbreak.(ABC News: Glyn Jones)</div>\", \"That includes 31 people who attended the Perth Mess Hall event at the centre of the outbreak.\", \"A further 1,488 casual contacts have also been identified, with 328 yet to be tested.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Close contact rules not yet adopted in WA</div>\", \"Prime Minister Scott Morrison today announced a change to the definition of 'close contact', so that only people who have been with a positive case for more than four hours in certain settings will need to isolate.\", \"The time they will spend in isolation will also be shortened to seven days, with rapid antigen testing replacing PCR tests in some situations.\", \"<img

close contact</div>\", \"Some states, including New South Wales and Victoria, will adopt the changes from midnight tonight.\", \"But that will not yet include WA, although Mr McGowan said he agreed \\\"in principle\\\" with the new rules.\", \"\\\"The settings agreed at national cabinet today are for jurisdictions with a high case load environment, with thousands of daily cases,\\\" Mr McGowan said.\", \"\\\"Western Australia is not in that position.\", \"Mr Morrison said he supported that approach.\", \"\\\"Their arrangements at present can deal with their testing and tracing, because they have so few cases there,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"But we all understand that at some point that will change.\\\"\", \"The Prime Minister said the change would help relieve pressure on PCR testing systems, which have been struggling with demand as case numbers rise.\", \"Travellers arriving in WA are currently required to show a negative PCR test taken in the 72 hours prior to their departure.\", \"Mr Morrison said WA had acknowledged this requirement would eventually have to be scrapped and would work with other states to transition to rapid antigen tests.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Very strong measures' in store for unvaccinated: Premier</div>\", \"Mr McGowan previously indicated while WA would have some restrictions in place when its borders reopened, he would like them to be minimal.\", \"But today he hinted those restrictions may now need to be stronger.\", \"<img

when the state's border reopens.(ABC News: Keane Bourke)</div>\", \"\\\"We will put in place various public health safety measures, or social measures, as required,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"The plans would be more around making sure that the unvaccinated don't go to venues where they can spread the virus or get sick.\", \"\\\"So [there will be] very strong measures for the unvaccinated and probably more extensive mask-wearing than we've been used to.\\\"\", \"The Premier said those measures were necessary to keep infection rates low while vaccination rates continued to climb.\", \"<img
