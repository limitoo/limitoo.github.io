But according to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), the value of record sales in 2021 is expected to surpass that of CDs for the first time since the late 1980s.\", \"\\\"The CD has proved exceptionally successful for nearly 40 years and remains a format of choice for many music fans who value sound quality, convenience and collectability,\\\" said a BPI spokesperson.\", \"\\\"Although demand has been following a long-term trend as consumers increasingly transition to streaming, resilient demand is likely to continue for many years, enhanced by special editions and other collectible releases.  \", \"\\\"If some retailers now see the format as less of a priority, this will create a further opportunity for others, such as independent shops and specialist chains such as HMV, to cater to the continuing demand.\\\"    \", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Out of fashion</div>\", \"Music industry observer Graham Jones points out that supermarkets have always carried a very limited selection of CDs, with an emphasis on big names such as Ed Sheeran.\", \"But as his book Last Shop Standing makes clear, the supermarkets could still make life difficult for record shops, especially by undercutting them on price.\", \"In one chapter, he recounts an incident from 2008, when a shop in the East Midlands found that rather than ordering copies of the latest Coldplay CD from the record company, it was cheaper to buy them on special offer from Morrisons and Asda and resell them.\", \"However, such incidents are unlikely to be repeated these days.\", \"\\\"Sales of CDs are slowing down, so I can understand why Sainsbury's are pulling out, really,\\\" he told the BBC.\", \"\\\"Vinyl is incredibly fashionable and the CD has gone out of fashion.\", \"\\\"A lot of indies [independent shops] may be stocking less CDs than they used to, but they're still selling. There's this myth that the CD is completely dead.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"006a906a41f211ecbbfb9801a7b2ee53"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"006a906a41f211ecbbfb9801a7b2ee53"}},
