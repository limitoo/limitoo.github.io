The answer is not to defund the police. It\\u2019s to give you the tools, the training, the funding to be partners, to be protectors.\\u201d\", \"The president\\u2019s visit comes against the backdrop of a pandemic-era rise in gun violence that has shattered American cities and reordered the politics of public safety, even as the rates of violent crime in places like New York remain well below those of the early 1990s. His appearance unfolded in a city on edge, a funeral for one of the two young police officers who were recently shot to death in Harlem while responding to a 911 call.\", \"\\u201cYesterday we gathered at St. Patrick\\u2019s Cathedral in mourning,\\u201d Mr. Adams said. \\u201cToday, here at 1 Police Plaza where I walked across that stage as a captain, we\\u2019re here in solidarity to deal with the issue of violence that has become pervasive, and not only in New York City, but in the cities across America.\\u201d\", \"In an already-difficult political environment for Democrats at the beginning of a midterm election year, Mr. Biden is navigating challenging crosscurrents: expectations from his political base to deliver on long-promised police accountability measures, and a concerted Republican effort to define Democrats as weak and untrustworthy on matters of crime.\", \"His struggling approval ratings and languishing legislative agenda have not helped \\u2014 but New York Democrats, including Mr. Adams, Gov. Kathy Hochul and several members of the congressional delegation, warmly embraced him on Thursday.\", \"Mr. Adams, New York\\u2019s second Black mayor, initially made a public name for himself as an advocate for combating police misconduct while serving as an officer on the force. Prominent national Democrats like Mr. Biden have embraced him as a powerful messenger on those issues, even as he has clashed with other political leaders at home over how to improve the city\\u2019s safety, with some Democrats arguing that he is too quick to embrace overly punitive measures, and is too reliant on policing.\", \"But for now, Mr. Adams is plainly emerging as an important validator for the president.\", \"\\u201cWe both know our highest calling, our most important mission, is protecting the people of this city, and of this country,\\u201d said Mr. Adams, who has declared himself the \\u201cBiden of Brooklyn\\u201d \\u2014 a nod to their overlapping bases of working-class voters of color. \\u201cThere is no recovery without public safety. There is no recovery without justice. They go hand in hand. That is why we\\u2019re working in lock step to end the gun violence that has shaken our city, our nation, to protect our people and the officers who are sworn to protect us.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden, for his part, described a shared vision with Mr. Adams that the best approach to public safety was not to divest from the police but rather to bolster departments, as well as initiatives that employ community members to intervene before violence occurs.\", \"He noted that he had called on Congress to increase federal grants to police departments by $300 million and encouraged localities to use stimulus funds to hire more officers and pay them overtime. At another point, Mr. Biden turned and singled out Officer Sumit Sulan, the rookie officer who shot and killed the gunman who fatally shot two policemen in Harlem last month. Officer Sulan rose and faced a standing ovation.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re about funding and providing the additional services you need beyond someone with a gun strapped\\u201d to their hip, Mr. Biden said, adding that there was another $200 million for community violence intervention programs in his budget proposal.\", \"Mr. Biden was expected later on Thursday to visit one such group that enlists community members, including those who previously committed crimes but now use their experience with the criminal justice system to discourage others from engaging in gang violence.\"]","href_hash":"e1c4eabe853711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e1c4eabe853711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
