He then made made an unsolicited offer for the company on 14 April.\", \"The next day, Twitter's board announced a plan to protect itself against a potential hostile takeover by adopting what is known as a \\\"limited-duration shareholder rights plan\\\", also known as a \\\"poison pill\\\".\", \"The move deters anyone from having more than a 15 percent stake in the company. It does this by allowing others to buy additional shares in the firm at a discount.\", \"A takeover bid is considered to be hostile when a person or business tries to take over another company against the wishes of the target firm's management.\", \"While the views of Twitter shareholders vary over what a fair price for a deal would be, many reached out to the company after Musk outlined his acquisition financing plan on Thursday and urged it not to let the opportunity for a deal slip away, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\", \"Twitter's board is expected to find that Musk's all-cash $54.20 per share offer for the company is too low by the time it reports quarterly earnings on Thursday. Nonetheless, some shareholders who agree with that stance still want Twitter to seek a better offer from Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $US270b, the sources told Reuters.\", \"One option available to Twitter's board is to open its books to Musk to try to coax him to sweeten his bid. Another would be to solicit offers from other potential bidders. While it is not yet clear which path Twitter will take, it is increasingly likely that its board will attempt to solicit a better offer from Musk even as it rebuffs the current one, the sources said.\", \"\\\"I wouldn't be surprised to wake up next week and see Musk raise what he called his best and final offer to possibly $US64.20 per share,\\\" one of the fund managers who is invested in Twitter said on condition of anonymity.\", \"\\\"He could also drop the whole thing entirely.

Musk has said Twitter needs to be taken private to grow and become a genuine platform for free speech.\", \"Representatives for Twitter and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\", \"The price expectations among Twitter shareholders for the deal diverge largely based on their investment strategy, the sources said.
