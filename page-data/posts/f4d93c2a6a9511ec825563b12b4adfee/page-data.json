The shocking photo garnered significant attention on social media.\\u00a0\", \"A post shared by Jalil Najafov (@jalilnajafov)\", \"\\\"On rare occasions, during mating season among sharks, 'mating scars' appear on female sharks' bodies caused by the males holding onto them. ... These scars are mostly deeper cuts and punctures, indicating a more forceful motivation such as coercive mating from the male's side,\\\" said Najafov, who captured the image in early December. He added photos of other female sharks he had photographed with large bite marks.\", \"A post shared by Jalil Najafov (@jalilnajafov)\", \"But experts he talked to believed the big bite taken of the 15-foot female shark weren't convinced that the bite was from a mating scar.\\u00a0\", \"Tristan Guttridge, a behavioral ecologist and wildlife presenter for Discovery's Shark Week, told Najafov that he didn't believe the bite was from mating.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Due to position as the wound [sic] looks like it's healed a fair bit and although mating scars can be nasty they are more superficial than that. The shape of it to me likely indicates a bite from another shark - seems a bit extreme for defense,\\\" he quoted Guttridge as saying.\\u00a0\", \"Michael Domeier, another Discovery presenter and director of the nonprofit Marine Conservation Science Institute, told Najafov that he was \\\"confident this is competitive aggression. I keep hearing people\\u2026describe this sort of thing as territorial aggression, but these highly migratory sharks don't have a traditional territory.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"That scar will heal to the point it won't be a good distinguishing mark,\\\" the expert said, per Najafov's post.\\u00a0\", \"A post shared by Jalil Najafov (@jalilnajafov)\", \"Najafov said that he was \\\"very lucky\\\" to have spotted and photographed the scar before it fully healed.\\u00a0\", \"Giant female great whites aren't out of the norm.
