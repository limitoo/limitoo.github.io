I can't really feel them to be honest,\\\" he replied.\", \"But it's a feeling that's worth the pain with Sanders raising more than double his target of $5000.\", \"That's money for food vouchers, sports gear and stationery to get children back into the school year.\", \"\\\"It's huge it means we can help more kids because every dollar goes to a piece of stationery that we can put into a pack for a child in need,\\\" said Jen Cherry, from the Back2School Project.\", \"Also at the finish line was a very proud family.\", \"\\\"Huge celebrations.
