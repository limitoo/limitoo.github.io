His run, which lasted for four months in 2019, was mainly the brainchild of two teenagers, David Oks and Henry Williams, who saw Gravel as a storied figure who wouldn\\u2019t prevail but could raise hell and push the political discussion leftward. Gravel sat on the sidelines and handed over his Twitter account.\", \"\\u201cMy real end goal has always been to have Bernie Sanders pick up our platform plank,\\u201d Williams says at a staff meeting in the movie. Later in the film, in June 2019, Williams says he hopes half the candidates, \\u201cpossibly including us,\\u201d will soon drop out, so that voters can vet contenders with a chance. Casting Tim Ryan, Bill de Blasio and John Delaney as villains \\u2014 while somewhat incongruously praising Marianne Williamson, who aided Gravel\\u2019s fund-raising efforts \\u2014 the movie suggests that Gravel had more substance than better-publicized long shots.\", \"The director, Skye Wallin, presents the correctness of Oks and Williams\\u2019s cause as a given. If you can get past that ingenuousness, \\u201cAmerican Gadfly\\u201d is enjoyable as a chronicle of teenage idealism and its frustrations. (In Iowa, Oks bemoans the inefficiency of meeting and greeting voters.) Gravel, in his appearances, comes across as avuncular, eager to share ideas but even more eager to encourage young acolytes.\"]","href_hash":"f4ec6a976d8f11ec8d5ebb937e6a5605"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f4ec6a976d8f11ec8d5ebb937e6a5605"}},
