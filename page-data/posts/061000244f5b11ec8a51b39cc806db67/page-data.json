To kill Black people, he answered, using a racial slur.\", \"For some parents and students, the video has laid bare what they say is a larger pattern of racist incidents in the largely white town where local officials are now scrambling to address those concerns.\", \"The Monroe County Sheriff\\u2019s Office said the teenager, who has been suspended and has not returned to school, was not an immediate danger, noting the weapon was an air pistol and that the video was recorded months ago. But that assessment has done little to quell concerns of parents who say their children have endured racial taunts and other incidents with little consequences for their harassers.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not an isolated incident,\\u201d said Tharaha Thavakumar, who is of Sri Lankan descent and is the mother of a 14-year-old freshman in the school district. \\u201cIt\\u2019s something that\\u2019s ingrained. And it isn\\u2019t going away.\\u201d\", \"As the shock of the video continued to percolate, the town\\u2019s school district was buffeted by a pair of new allegations, accusing Pittsford students of taunting Black students from another high school \\u2014 including making monkey noises and using a racial slur \\u2014 during two soccer games in late September.\", \"The Pittsford district said an investigation found no evidence of such behavior, while officials from the rival high school \\u2014 in nearby Greece, N.Y. \\u2014 said their staff found the claims credible.\", \"The suggestion that Pittsford could be at the center of another racist incident prompted agonized responses from school leaders and officials in the town of some 30,000 people, where charming old houses sit on large lawns with white-picket fences.\", \"Pittsford\\u2019s main street is home to boutiques, salons and a 19th-century Town Hall, and its two high schools \\u2014 among the best academically in the state \\u2014 are surrounded by beautifully maintained sports fields. The median household income is more than $120,000, according to census figures.\", \"Almost the entire adult population has a high-school degree or better, in a town whose school system includes nine schools total and some 5,500 students.\", \"In an interview, Michael Pero, the superintendent of Pittsford\\u2019s schools, stressed that the school district is grappling with the same forces as American society as a whole.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think that anyone wants to have racism attached to their organization, their community, their schools,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut I also don\\u2019t want to sugarcoat this and say racist acts don\\u2019t happen in Pittsford, because they do. It\\u2019s a national issue, it\\u2019s something we\\u2019re all working through.\\u201d\", \"In early November, the school district announced the hiring of an \\u201cequity and diversity coordinator,\\u201d with a wide-ranging mandate that includes increasing its tiny number of nonwhite teachers and administrators, as well as curriculum evaluation and supporting \\u201crestorative practices\\u201d in classrooms.\", \"That comes on the heels of a series of \\u201clistening circles\\u201d for parents and students, held by two groups devoted to encouraging emotional health in children and helping communities heal in the aftermath of racist incidents.\", \"But for upset parents like Ms. Thavakumar, such measures are far too meek to address more entrenched problems, including a nearly complete lack of Black teachers in the district. A 2016 investigation by WXXI, a local public radio station, found that just one of the district\\u2019s nearly 500 teachers was Black.\", \"The district says diversity hiring has increased in recent years: As of this fall, it says the district has 13 teachers or administrators who identify as people of color \\u2014 about 2.2 percent of the entire number of \\u201ccertificated staff\\u201d \\u2014 and 53 employees in that category districtwide.\", \"The Pittsford schools are part of the Urban-Suburban program, a voluntary desegregation plan that brings students from the Rochester city school district to wealthier schools outside the city limits.\", \"One of those students, Jaylen Wims, a senior who lives in Rochester, said he and other Black friends regularly endured \\u201csome sort of iffy or racist incident.\\u201d And while the gun video upset him, it didn\\u2019t surprise him.\", \"\\u201cThe magnitude of it made it an outlier, but in terms of having something occur? No,\\u201d he said.\", \"In 2019, there were local media reports of a swastika and a slur for Black people carved in a desk. The same year, the school district found itself embroiled in a controversy after a Black History Month exhibit at a Pittsford elementary school mistakenly had photos of white men instead of the Black inventors who were being recognized. And earlier this year, the school district apologized for a fourth-grade worksheet which suggested that enslaved Africans had \\u201cagreed to work for colonists\\u201d in exchange for a trip to the New World.\", \"Local leaders say the problems within the school district are a reflection of the town\\u2019s struggles to grapple with racism.\", \"In 2016, a series of fliers directing people to a white supremacist website were anonymously left on residents\\u2019 driveways in Pittsford and a neighboring town. Those fliers prompted strident denunciations from local officials, as well as antiracism rallies and the formation of a group of concerned local residents \\u2014 PittsForward \\u2014 committed to \\u201caddressing systemic and institutional racism.\\u201d\", \"The next year, Pittsford elected its first Black man to the town board, Kevin Beckford, a first-generation Jamaican immigrant and former bank executive. Inspired to run by the racist fliers, he says he realized that \\u201cthere\\u2019s some underlying issues that were really kept under the covers here\\u201d because of concerns about the town\\u2019s reputation as a desirous place to live and educate children.\", \"One of the first Democrats elected to the town board after a decades-long domination by Republicans, Mr. Beckford, 56, says one telling moment in his first campaign came when he was petitioning to get on the ballot in 2016, and finding that few residents would open their door. He altered his strategy, allowing a white campaign volunteer to knock and then introduce him.\", \"\\u201cThey would be friendly to me,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut it was just that notion of opening the door to a Black person.\\u201d\", \"Much of the debate over racism has played out online, with social media posts from some members of the community who felt that accusations against students were false. Some Democrats also expressed concerns about racism in the run-up to local elections.\", \"One of those candidates was Kendra Evans, a Democrat who fell short in an attempt to oust William A. Smith Jr., a Republican, as town supervisor. Ms. Evans, who is white and the mother of three adopted children \\u2014 all of whom are people of color \\u2014 says her children began \\u201cexperiencing micro- and macro-aggressions back in elementary school.\\u201d\", \"That includes Grace, her 15-year-old daughter, who is Haitian and recalls being called a racist vulgarity in fourth grade. And at a recent rally on the steps of Town Hall, Grace plead with Mr. Smith and Mr. Pero to do more to confront the problem.\", \"\\u201cRacism isn\\u2019t new here,\\u201d she said, \\u201cand neither is us asking for help.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Smith says that the recent incidents \\u201care not at all representative of our town or its people,\\u201d noting a 2018 resolution he sponsored affirming Pittsford\\u2019s embrace of \\u201cresidents from myriad national, ethnic and religious backgrounds.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Smith, who has been town supervisor since 2014, also supported the creation of a volunteer \\u201cequity review board,\\u201d but in a video posted from last year on the PittsForward Facebook page, Mr. Smith struck a more skeptical tone.\", \"\\u201cWe live in this era of rigid cultural orthodoxy which frankly makes the medieval church look liberal by comparison,\\u201d Mr. Smith says.\", \"He continues: \\u201cIt has its own holy trinity: diversity, equity and inclusion. Which, from my perspective, diversity means everyone is supposed to look different and they are all supposed to think alike; an equity that\\u2019s based on massive inequities toward whole groups of people; and a concept of inclusion which means excommunication for those who do not recite the catechism syllable for syllable.\\u201d\", \"Asked why he made this statement, Mr. Smith said he was trying to express \\u201cwhat I consider to be the important distinction between what I and most people think of as diversity and equity and inclusion and what a small, extreme group of voices in our town mean by them.\\u201d\", \"As the town board and school district look for answers, the recent episodes have also sparked a robust response from students in the district, who staged a walkout in late September to protest the school\\u2019s response to the incidents, organized by a student group called Diversify Pittsford.\", \"Ameera Duarte, the group\\u2019s founder, said that the school district could take a major step by \\u201clistening to students of color and taking them seriously and then actually acting on what they say they are going to do.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThey need to work on showing us that they actually care and want to help,\\u201d said Ms. Duarte, who is 16 and a junior at Pittsford Sutherland High School.\", \"State Senator Samra G. Brouk, a first-term Democrat who graduated from Pittsford Sutherland in 2004, said that the reports of racist behavior were sadly familiar.\", \"Senator Brouk, who is Black, said that she and her younger brothers \\u2014 also past Pittsford students \\u2014 had endured racial slurs while they were students there. \\u201cThe difference now is our young people now have the language. They know there is support and they can be more vocal about experiences.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"061000244f5b11ec8a51b39cc806db67"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"061000244f5b11ec8a51b39cc806db67"}},
