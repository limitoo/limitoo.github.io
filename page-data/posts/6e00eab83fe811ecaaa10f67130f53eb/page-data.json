Tony Hsieh of Zappos promised to deliver it. Clinique named a perfume for it. Happiness has been the primary, bright-yellow pursuit of those living during what is now again modish to call, with disdain, \\u201clate capitalism,\\u201d as if the revolution were right around the corner, along with one\\u2019s Sweetgreen order. It\\u2019s the ultimate American oh-what-a-feeling, perpetually for sale and eternally elusive \\u2014 and it\\u2019s been a bonanza for publishing.\", \"In \\u201cOn Consolation,\\u201d the prolific author, professor and former politician Michael Ignatieff pushes aside this commercial, foamy emotion and dives into the murkier waters beneath. In these depths, which often are close to deaths, any notion of happiness has ebbed or evaporated entirely; indeed, circumstances can be so desperate that there seems no way back to shore. What can help in such moments? Certainly not a texted smiley face. Mental-health professionals and their pills might also be inadequate. \\u201cThey treat our suffering as an illness from which we need to recover,\\u201d Ignatieff writes. \\u201cYet when suffering becomes understood as an illness with a cure, something is lost.\\u201d His book is an ambitious restoration project, a survey course of Eurocentric anguish from Job to the Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz.\", \"I must warn those weak of stomach that the straits faced by Ignatieff\\u2019s subjects, mostly white and male though they may be, are among the most dire that Western history has to offer. Cicero\\u2019s beloved daughter and grandson die, for example, and subsequently assassins arrive to saw off the statesman\\u2019s head and hands; Marc Antony\\u2019s wife then attacked his severed tongue with needles. Painful kidney stones were the least of Michel de Montaigne\\u2019s problems; he was kidnapped, and watched as neighbors infected with plague lay down with resignation in graves they dug themselves. Abraham Lincoln agonized over hanging young Civil War deserters, then met his own abrupt end at the theater. Primo Levi survived and chronicled the Holocaust, but plunged into depression and down a flight of stairs at 67.\", \"Speeding through the centuries with such ill-fated figures, you\\u2019re rudely immersed in the often compartmentalized truth that you and everyone you\\u2019ve ever loved are all going to die some day, possibly out of turn, possibly alone and scared in a hospital \\u2014 like Ignatieff\\u2019s father, he reveals remorsefully. And even if you win every accolade desired in life, you\\u2019re likely to be forgotten quite soon. (\\u201cAfter repute, oblivion,\\u201d as Marcus Aurelius put it.) We are all, in fact, ill-fated.\", \"How to go on then, and why?\", \"\\u201cOn Consolation\\u201d takes the erosion of organized religion as a given, and is directed at secularists who still seek meaning and purpose: nonbelievers, not nihilists. Still, Ignatieff believes that holy texts of all denominations can be mined for comfort and insight even by the faithless, for a spirituality as customized as one of those Sweetgreen salads. The crux of the Psalms is not their conviction that the Messiah will appear, but their depiction, over frequent revisions, of common human experience: \\u201cThe worst of despair,\\u201d their creators knew, \\u201cis to feel alone.\\u201d Maybe, against Sartre, heaven is other people.\", \"But then again, perhaps the purest solace is found solo, Ignatieff suggests, doing what moderns would call journaling (not the productivity-centered bullet kind) or attempting autobiography \\u2014 as Aurelius did; also Boethius, imminently to be strangled by barbarians \\u201cwith a cord until his eyes stood out from their sockets, and then clubbed\\u201d; and Albert Camus, who survived tuberculosis to win a Nobel Prize, only to discover it had a chilling effect on his writing, and then perish in a car accident. At times \\u201cOn Consolation\\u201d feels like Edward Gorey\\u2019s \\u201cThe Gashlycrumb Tinies\\u201d without the pictures.\", \"Ignatieff can be droll, re-enacting meetings between old friend-philosophers like Adam Smith and David Hume \\u2014 the latter, ailing from \\u201ca disorder in my bowels,\\u201d joked that Charon might let him revise his work one more time before foraying across the river Styx. But humor is not one of Ignatieff\\u2019s recommended solace staples. More satisfying to him is the poetry that abject misery and grief can inspire. When words fail, as they so often do, there are love messages to decode in the visual arts, as when El Greco embedded a portrayal of his young son into his painting \\u201cThe Burial of the Count of Orgaz,\\u201d a parish commission finished in 1586 that draws crowds to this day. (Though I\\u2019m not sure they flock, as Ignatieff asserts, because of an ineffable longing \\u201cthat time should not slip so irrecoverably into forgetting, that the present should not be so fleeting, that the future would not be so shrouded and so unknown\\u201d; some may have just seen it on TripAdvisor.)\", \"Most transcendently, Ignatieff says, for those able to hear, consolation is available in music \\u2014 though \\u201cin the death of a child,\\u201d he acknowledges, recounting a bereaved Mahler pacing the Dutch canals with Freud, \\u201cmusic met its match.\\u201d Sitting among a teary audience at a concert devoted to the Psalms, where Ignatieff lectured, inspired this project, which gathered further momentum following the coronavirus, when he saw a symphony orchestra break from isolation into Zoom squares to play Beethoven\\u2019s \\u201cOde to Joy.\\u201d Happiness this wasn\\u2019t, but something deeper and more enduring.\"]","href_hash":"6e00eab83fe811ecaaa10f67130f53eb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6e00eab83fe811ecaaa10f67130f53eb"}},
