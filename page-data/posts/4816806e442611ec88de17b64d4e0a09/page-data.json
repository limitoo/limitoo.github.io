Engelhardt.\", \"He added: \\u201cOf course, the principles at stake when it comes to the mandate are not reducible to dollars and cents. The public interest is also served by maintaining our constitutional structure and maintaining the liberty of individuals to make intensely personal decisions according to their own convictions \\u2014 even, or perhaps particularly, when those decisions frustrate government officials.\\u201d\", \"He was joined by Judges Edith H. Jones and Kyle Duncan. All three are Republican appointees.\", \"The Biden administration is likely to appeal, but a Justice Department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\", \"In a filing asking the Fifth Circuit to withdraw its stay earlier this week, the Justice Department argued that requiring large employers to force their workers to get vaccinated or submit to weekly testing was well within the authority granted to by Congress to Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. It also said blocking the mandate would have dire consequences.\", \"Keeping the mandate from coming into effect \\u201cwould likely cost dozens or even hundreds of lives per day, in addition to large numbers of hospitalizations, other serious health effects, and tremendous costs,\\u201d the Justice Department said in its filing. \\u201cThat is a confluence of harms of the highest order.\\u201d\", \"The ruling by the panel of the Fifth Circuit is unlikely to be the final word. Some challenges to the mandate are in other circuits, and the cases will be consolidated before a randomly chosen one of those jurisdictions. The Supreme Court is expected to eventually decide the matter.\", \"President Biden announced in September that his administration would issue such a mandate as one of several steps to try to increase immunization rates and end the pandemic, which so far has killed about 750,000 Americans. Other mandates applied to federal employees and federal contractors.\", \"In early November, OSHA, an agency that is part of the Labor Department, issued the standard for companies with at least 100 employees. It would force them to require unvaccinated employees to wear masks indoors starting Dec. 5. Employees who remain unvaccinated by Jan. 4 would have to undergo weekly testing at work.\", \"The proposed rule makes an exception for employees who do not come into close contact with other people at their jobs, such as those who work at home or exclusively outdoors.\", \"A coalition of plaintiffs \\u2014 including several employers and Republican-controlled states \\u2014 immediately challenged the employer mandate in court. Their lawsuit argued that the mandate was an unlawful overreach that exceeded the authority Congress had legitimately delegated to OSHA.\", \"Among other things, they argued that the agency has no power to regulate protections against exposure to disease, as opposed to workplace hazards like asbestos, and that framing the mandate as a workplace safety effort was just a pretext for the Biden administration\\u2019s real motivation: pressuring Americans who have been reluctant to get vaccinated.\", \"Judge Englehardt\\u2019s ruling strongly sided with their point of view.\", \"OSHA, he wrote, was created by Congress to ensure safe and healthful working conditions but was not \\u201cintended to authorize a workplace safety administration in the deep recesses of the federal bureaucracy to make sweeping pronouncements on matters of public health affecting every member of society in the profoundest of ways.\\u201d\", \"The judge also scored the notion that the circumstances of the rule put forward by OSHA, under authority granted by Congress for \\u201cemergency\\u201d situations, qualified as an emergency.\", \"\\u201cThe mandate\\u2019s stated impetus \\u2014 a purported \\u2018emergency\\u2019 that the entire globe has now endured for nearly two years, and which OSHA itself spent nearly two months responding to \\u2014 is unavailing as well,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cAnd its promulgation grossly exceeds OSHA\\u2019s statutory authority.\\u201d\", \"Some large employers have already decided on their own to impose vaccine mandates on their workforces, including 3M, Procter & Gamble, IBM, Tyson Foods and the airlines American, Alaska, JetBlue and United. Most workers have complied, though a small number have quit.\", \"Former President Donald J. Trump appointed both Judge Englehardt and Judge Duncan in 2018. Judge Jones was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan in 1985.\"]","href_hash":"4816806e442611ec88de17b64d4e0a09"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4816806e442611ec88de17b64d4e0a09"}},
