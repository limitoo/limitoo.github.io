There she took a three-hour flight to New Delhi, then boarded a 16-hour flight to Newark.\", \"Ms. Dave, 30, was traveling to meet her boyfriend, Nirmit Shelat, 31, whom she had not seen since last winter, when she had returned to their home state of Gujarat, expecting to stay for a few months. But then India experienced a devastating coronavirus surge, and her travel was restricted.\", \"Mr. Nirmit, a project manager at Bank of America, had stayed in the United States. When the United States finally lifted its restrictions on travelers from India, Mr. Nirmit went online, booked an Air India flight for Ms. Dave and paid $1,700 for the one-way ticket from New Delhi to Newark\\u2019s Liberty International Airport.\", \"On Sunday night, Mr. Nirmit drove 600 miles north to New Jersey from their home in Charlotte, N.C., checked into an Airbnb in Freehold, N.J., at 6:30 a.m. and then headed to Newark\\u2019s Terminal B to greet Ms. Dave.\", \"\\u201cMy Lady Luck is back,\\u201d he said as he waited. \\u201cYou can make daily calls, stay connected by FaceTime, but you want to experience her fingers, her touch, her kiss. She told me she wants to break the Apple wall.\\u201d\", \"They saw each other from down a hallway, and embraced upon reuniting. She kept her mask on as they kissed. He grew emotional. She was carrying three roller suitcases and four bags.\", \"\\u201cThe Apple wall is broken,\\u201d she said.\", \"At Miami International Airport, Natalia Vitorini, a 28-year-old student living in Miami, met her parents on Concourse D after they got off the morning\\u2019s first flight from S\\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. She had her 3-week-old son in a stroller.\", \"Her mother, D\\u00e9bora Vitorini, 56, who works in the biomedical industry in S\\u00e3o Paulo, bought her ticket within hours of the announcement of the reopening date. She and her husband, Sergio, arrived a little after 6 a.m.\", \"The last time they had seen each other was in March 2020. Natalia Vitorini got pregnant earlier this year, and gave birth to her son a few weeks ago. \\u201cI was waiting for the border to open so my mom can come to see my baby,\\u201d she said.\", \"When Natalia Abrahao, 40, saw her fianc\\u00e9, Mark Ogertschnig, 45, emerge into Terminal B at Newark off a flight from Amsterdam at about noon, she leapt into his arms. He spun her around as she kicked up her heels.\", \"\\u201cFinally!\\u201d she said. \\u201cFinally!\\u201d\", \"The couple had gotten engaged on March 13 last year at Gianni\\u2019s, a restaurant in the Versace mansion in Miami, just days before international travel shut down.\", \"Mr. Ogertschnig, who is from the Netherlands, had been living in the United States, and they lived together for the first five months of the pandemic, but his visa expired and he had to return home. Twice they had taken advantage of a loophole in the travel rules that let travelers from a banned country spend two weeks in a country that was not on the list, such as Canada or Mexico, and then enter the United States.\", \"In August, they reunited in Canc\\u00fan for a week to celebrate her 40th birthday. \\u201cI never loved Mexico so much!\\u201d she said.\", \"When the United States announced its reopening plans, he promised to be on the first flight. He booked a flight for Nov. 1. He then moved it when he found out Nov. 8 was the official reopening.\", \"\\u201cI was almost like, if you\\u2019re not there the first day, I\\u2019m done,\\u201d she said, laughing, as she waited for him to emerge from screening.\", \"In the early afternoon, the arrivals area at Kennedy Airport\\u2019s Terminal 1 began to fill up with people waiting for loved ones, many with balloons in hand. By the time her mother arrived, Svenja Ostwald\\u2019s two daughters had accidentally released the M and I balloons they were holding to spell out \\u201cOmi,\\u201d a German term of endearment for grandmother.\", \"The two massive silver letters glittered near the ceiling, giving the arrivals area a more festive feeling. Ms. Ostwald, 37, who lives in Manhattan, had picked up the girls early from day care in order to greet her mother, Christiane Ecklemann, who was flying in from Frankfurt at 2:04 p.m. She estimated that if it were not for the travel restrictions, the girls, who are 5 and 3, would have seen their grandmother at least six times.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m overwhelmed,\\u201d said Ms. Ostwald after she and her daughters hugged Ms. Ecklemann, 70, shortly after 3 p.m.\", \"The distance had been difficult not only for Ms. Ostwald, who would have welcomed her mother\\u2019s help with the girls, but also, she said, for Ms. Ecklemann, who lives alone. \\u201cShe was isolated, and not being able to share things was hard,\\u201d she said.\", \"Soon after the Ostwalds reunited with Ms. Ecklemann, a small dog named Whiskey yipped beneath the escaped balloons in Terminal 1. Ye Jin, 36, had brought the dog with her to pick up her mother, Ni Fu Ying, 64, who was flying in from Berlin and who had not visited since the start of the pandemic.\", \"Seeing her mother at last made her grateful that the United States was accepting visitors from abroad again, she said, adding that the vaccine rules did not bother her.\", \"\\u201cIt makes me feel better about her flying,\\u201d she said, gesturing to her mother. \\u201cI just wish it could have happened much sooner.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8909c67a41f711ec9b3a000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8909c67a41f711ec9b3a000017025a03"}},
