We'll update that of course as those case numbers come in and we get more of an idea of what kind of trajectory we're on - we update that modelling\", \"\\\"But I think that people can still use those numbers to get a sense of what might be coming over the coming weeks and months.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/54302/eight_col_Shaun_Hendy.jpg?1522138349\\\" alt=\\\"Shaun Hendy\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nShaun Hendy is a professor of physics, and specialises in modelling. \\nPhoto: supplied\\n</div>\", \"Hendy said the modelling made use of the best programmes developed internationally to predict possible outbreak scenarios, but they aren't perfectly tailored to those countries that have taken a less typical path, such as New Zealand's elimination strategy.\", \"\\\"We're still having control at our borders - those kind of details weren't taken into account in that modelling.\\\"\", \"Another point that is useful when looking at the modelling paper is that some terms used within the modelling field may be different to how they are used in everyday language, Hendy said.\\u00a0 \\u00a0\", \"\\\"[People] are used to talking about the cases reported on a daily basis, and some of the numbers that were reported [in the modelling] were actually total infections - so also include the infections that we never learn about because people don't get a test.\\\"\", \"He doesn't believe most people will see models that show worst case scenarios as 'crying wolf.\", \"\\\"Most people do understand ... we're not actually trying to give a weather forecast, we're trying to give people an idea about the risks they face and how their individual decisions and the government's decisions might change those risks.\", \"\\\"The fact that [people take action based on the risks] actually changes the outcomes - the trajectory we take really depends on the decisions we all make.\\\"\", \"Hendy said the modelling released in the paper takes into account the red light Covid-19 framework setting and the booster programme, but it was too early for it to reflect the effect from the government's move to reduce the time between booster shots to three months.\", \"\\\"Over the next few weeks we should begin to see numbers of people who get boosted rise, so that will have a big impact, and will tend to push us toward some of our more optimistic scenarios.\\\"\", \"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"4c3aedd488ae11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4c3aedd488ae11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
