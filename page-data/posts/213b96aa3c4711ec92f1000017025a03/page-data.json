Mr. Moore died on Jan. 20, 2020, of what the coroner\\u2019s report said was \\u201cacute intestinal obstruction\\u201d because of bullet wounds to his abdomen from the shooting.\", \"In the statement, District Attorney Chesa Boudin said Officer Cha \\u201clacked a lawful basis to even arrest\\u201d Mr. Moore and that he was unarmed at his home when he was shot by Officer Cha.\", \"\\u201cWhen officers inflict unwarranted violence in flagrant disregard of their training, it denigrates the hard work of other police officers and shatters the trust our community places in law enforcement,\\u201d Mr. Boudin said. \\u201cRebuilding that trust requires us to hold those officers who inflict unlawful violence accountable.\\u201d\", \"The charges against Officer Cha include voluntary manslaughter, assault with a semiautomatic firearm, enhancements for personal use of a firearm and infliction of great bodily injury, the San Francisco district attorney\\u2019s office said in a statement on Tuesday.
