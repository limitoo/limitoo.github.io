Mr. Buffett\\u2019s prognostications aside, not everyone would have encouraged her to bet on herself. Especially because she made the bet by emptying her 401(k).\", \"Ms. Edwards, a single mother of three, invested the $5,000 she had saved for retirement to pay for marketing and make a donation of $500 to hold her market on the Emmanuel Baptist Church grounds in St. Petersburg. She knew it was a risk. \\u201cThat was my only savings,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBecause I had so many expenses, I always made the minimum deposits\\u201d in Roskamp\\u2019s retirement savings plan. Withdrawing the money came with a penalty in addition to the several sleepless nights it cost her. She paid the 10 percent penalty the I.R.S. levies for cashing in retirement savings before you turn 59\\u00bd.\", \"Her financial adviser, Toriano Parker, provided a measure of comfort. \\u201cInstead of talking me down about using my 401(k), he said, \\u2018You should do it,\\u2019\\u201d she said. Her age, which afforded her time to replenish her retirement savings, was a factor in his approval. So was her research into Saturday Morning Shoppe\\u2019s potential profitability. \\u201cRenee had a very solid business plan,\\u201d Mr. Parker said.\", \"He said he wouldn\\u2019t have supported other clients\\u2019 betting the bank on a start-up. \\u201cYou really have to weigh the decision to drain an account like a 401(k), or any retirement account, very carefully,\\u201d he said. \\u201cFor most people, it\\u2019s too much of a risk.\\u201d A flood of new entrepreneurs since the start of the pandemic may not have gotten the memo \\u2014 including those who are starting the second or third chapter of their career and might have had retirement in their sights.\", \"From the second half of 2020 through May 2021, the Census Bureau tracked the highest number of applications to form businesses since the records started being kept in 2004, a recent report from the National Bureau of Economic Research found. Bank loans and venture capital probably did not provide liftoff for most of those businesses. According to 2019 data from the Kauffman Foundation, a nonprofit that works to bolster education and entrepreneurship, nearly 65 percent of entrepreneurs use personal and family savings to fund their start-ups.\", \"Ms. Edwards, who is among the surge in Black women who became entrepreneurs during the pandemic, suspected she would have trouble securing a loan and didn\\u2019t want to waste time trying (her concerns were not unfounded; Black entrepreneurs\\u2019 loan requests are one-third as likely to be approved as white entrepreneurs\\u2019, the Kauffman Foundation has found). Opportunity was knocking: \\u201cI knew all kinds of people in my community who were making things like skin creams and spice rubs, and they didn\\u2019t have anywhere to sell them,\\u201d she said. She also knew that people who had been shut in because of Covid-19 were eager to interact, especially in outdoor settings.\", \"Saturday Morning Shoppe\\u2019s first installment was in April. Within 90 days, following a timeline Mr. Parker set up for her, Ms. Edwards paid herself back: She opened an Individual Retirement Account and funded it with the same amount she had taken from her 401(k) and enough to cover what she had lost in penalties. (Although she did miss gains she could have reaped by staying invested in the stock market.) By October, when she quit her day job, the market had mushroomed to 150 vendors from 64 and moved from the church parking lot to Tropicana Field, the Tampa Bay Rays\\u2019 home turf. In December, a second Saturday Morning Shoppes will open in Atlanta.\", \"This is a path that many experts recommend against. \\u201cThe first thing we tell people is absolutely not to tap into their retirement account,\\u201d said Elizabeth Isele, the founder and chief executive of the Global Institute for Experienced Entrepreneurship. Though Ms. Edwards is younger than the entrepreneurs over age 50 the institute is devoted to, Ms. Isele is wary of any risk to a secure retirement.\", \"\\u201cOne of the sad statistics out there is that so few people have any retirement savings,\\u201d she said. According to the New School\\u2019s Retirement Equity Lab, 36 percent of 35- to 54-year-old Americans have no retirement savings. At the time of her launch, Ms. Edwards fell into the category of the 43 percent who had less than $10,000 saved. \\u201cThey\\u2019re vulnerable,\\u201d Ms. Isele added. \\u201cWomen especially are in a deplorable position.\\u201d\", \"Instead of tapping retirement funds, the institute advises crowdfunding to get a business off the ground. \\u201cIf you put your idea out there on Kickstarter and no one is willing to invest even a dollar, you know before you put in a huge amount of time that it might not work,\\u201d Ms. Isele said. But if the idea proves popular, raising a few thousand dollars on a crowdfunding platform may be doable.\", \"Noah Damsky, a principal at Marina Wealth Advisors in California who has worked with several would-be entrepreneurs considering drawing down their I.R.A.s, has not set a policy of outright discouragement. \\u201cI don\\u2019t tell anybody what to do,\\u201d he said. Instead, he helps them see blind spots. \\u201cI\\u2019ll work out projections so they understand their risk profile.\\u201d\", \"Marianne Nolte didn\\u2019t need that kind of help when she started Imagine Financial Services in Fallbrook, Calif., in 2020.\", \"Ms. Nolte, 55, was already an entrepreneur when she decided she wanted to become a certified financial planner. For more than two decades, she had run a video production company. \\u201cI thrive as a small-business owner,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s my happy place.\\u201d Acting as her parents\\u2019 informal financial adviser helped her discover an aptitude for money management. In 2014, she earned her license as a certified financial planner. Five years later, after working at an advisory firm to learn the ropes, she was putting together a business plan that involved tapping her I.R.A.\", \"\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t a huge amount of my portfolio,\\u201d Ms. Nolte said. \\u201cBut it was enough that I got a slap on the hand from the I.R.S.,\\u201d meaning the same 10 percent penalty Ms. Edwards paid for taking the early withdrawal. She does not regret it. Still, she would not advise most clients to follow her lead. \\u201cMy path was not just the result of needing a change in the middle of Covid. I had a solid plan in place and had crunched the numbers.\\u201d Armed with her license, she also had a good reason to trust her instincts when it comes to her financial health.\", \"Ellen Curtis had experience with start-ups when she started the custom denim jacket company Statement by Ellen C. in 2020, too. But Ms. Curtis, 77, who closed a private nursing company she ran in Los Angeles, Curtis Concierge Nursing, to protect her health at the start of the pandemic, was not as focused as Ms. Nolte on aligning every decimal point. \\u201cThis time I didn\\u2019t have a business plan,\\u201d she said. The $8,000 of personal savings she invested in making batches of appliqu\\u00e9d jackets to sell was a gamble, one she considered safe because it didn\\u2019t involve digging into her investment accounts. Starting a business during the pandemic has proved more challenging than she thought, and she is not sure when, or if, she\\u2019ll feel financially secure enough to fully retire. \\u201cI haven\\u2019t made a profit yet,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt does feel like I took a risk.\\u201d\", \"Here are some tips on what to consider before dipping into retirement funds to open a business.\"]","href_hash":"3783943a446c11ecbf622b99bd10133a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3783943a446c11ecbf622b99bd10133a"}},
