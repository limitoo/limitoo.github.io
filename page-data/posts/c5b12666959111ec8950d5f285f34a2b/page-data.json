I felt they were fielding a pretty mediocre XI, in their first test against South Africa, and predicted that they might struggle.\", \"To say I was flabbergasted by the ease of New Zealand's eventual innings and 276-run win wouldn't be an understatement.\", \"I suspect the result says more about the turmoil South African cricket is in, rather than the ability of the Black Caps. But, never mind, they thrashed the pants off the Proteas, so well done.\", \"Which brings me to the White Ferns.\", \"I've not written the most flattering things about that team over the years. Not so much because of how they've played or the results they've had, but because of the free ride they've enjoyed in the media.\", \"The White Ferns, and Football Ferns for that matter, are outliers of a sort. No matter how badly they play, the reaction always tends to be of the 'oh well, better luck next time' variety.\", \"They tried valiantly, they were thrashed out of sight, but we're still immensely proud of them.\", \"That's rather unusual for high-performance sport and, I have to admit, rather irritating from my point of view.\", \"Well, the White Ferns are in fine form at the moment, in large part because of the deeds of allrounder Amelia Kerr.\", \"Now you'll remember that Kerr isn't long back from a prolonged break from the game, for personal reasons.\", \"I don't know what they were and don't want to know. And I'll tell you why.\", \"Familiarity with athletes doesn't breed contempt, although it can do.\", \"As an aside, I do often chuckle at the way some people are perceived when, from first-hand experience, I can tell you they're not the person they're portrayed to be.\", \"No, familiarity with athletes breeds compromise and that's no good for a sports writer. The minute you're compromised by your relationship or knowledge of or liking for an athlete, you're no good to your audience or your employers.\", \"We're all human, we all have a story, but knowing an athlete's story immediately colours your appraisal of them.\", \"So I don't know Kerr. I played with her uncle way back and am forever indebted to her father, Robbie, but that's it.\", \"Just on Robbie Kerr, he was a jack of all trades at Cricket Wellington at a time when my relationship with the Firebirds was at an all-time low. They couldn't stand me, I wasn't particularly fond of them, and Robbie acted as a go-between.\", \"For that reason, too, I've not wanted to know a thing about Amelia Kerr, because of the fondness I had for her father.\", \"What I can say about her is that she is a very fine cricketer. Kerr's leg spin has tended to be the strong suit in the early part of her international career, but it is as a batter that we're likely to end up remembering her best.\", \"She is a determined, resourceful and intelligent player who has the world at her feet. What happens from here on is up to her.\", \"Women's sport is the future. It's where the greatest potential for growth is and from where innumerable role models should emerge in the years to come.\", \"If we do this right, then White Ferns players will be as revered - and well-paid - as the Black Caps are. We won't talk about male or female players anymore; it'll all be part of the same discussion about who our best cricketers are.\", \"The upcoming ICC Women's World Cup is a great launching pad for that.\", \"Australia, particularly, and England remain the benchmarks, but the White Ferns' recent performances against India augur well for them at this tournament too.\", \"South Africa have some genuinely elite players and the West Indies can't be discounted either.\", \"If I had any advice, especially for you blokes out there, it's to give this world cup a go. Watch a few games, familiarise yourself with some of the better players and appreciate the talent.\", \"The batting is very good. There's not a lot of express pace in the bowling department and fielding remains the biggest area for female players to improve upon, but the batting is excellent.\", \"A generation ago, batters battled to penetrate the field, let alone hit over it. Now they're clearing boundaries with ease and not just over the leg side either.\", \"I don't know how the White Ferns will go. Recent performances at world cups have been poor.\", \"In many ways I won't be remotely bothered if they do badly, because my allegiance is to cricket rather than the team that happens to have a fern on their cap.\", \"After all, it's not like I know any of the players.\"]","href_hash":"c5b12666959111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c5b12666959111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
