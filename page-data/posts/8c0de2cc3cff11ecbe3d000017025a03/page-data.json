The Conservative Party spent about $3 million, according to its chairman, on television and radio ads arguing that the initiatives were tantamount to corruption. Republicans mounted a whistle-stop \\u201cJust Say No\\u201d tour that traversed 40 counties in 10 days. By comparison, Democrats spent and did little.\", \"At issue were three of five proposed constitutional amendments listed on the back of voters\\u2019 ballots. The first would have required that, for redistricting purposes, incarcerated New Yorkers be counted at their last place of residence. But the League of Women Voters of New York and the Conservative Party argued the measure would have also reduced the power of minority parties in the redistricting process.\", \"Another proposal would have eliminated a rule requiring voters to register at least 10 days before an election, while yet another would have removed a rule requiring voters to provide an excuse \\u2014 such as that they are leaving town or incapacitated \\u2014 when requesting an absentee ballot.\", \"All three measures failed on Election Day, according to The Associated Press.\", \"Voters opposed the three proposals from Niagara County in the north to Nassau County on Long Island. They passed in four of New York City\\u2019s five boroughs, but not by particularly large margins. Many New York City voters did not vote on the ballot questions at all. Staten Island, as usual, was the odd borough out. All three measures failed there.\", \"Two other ballot proposals fared better. One that passed would preserve in the State Constitution the \\u201cright to clean air, clean water, and a healthful environment.\\u201d Another that passed is meant to make courts run more efficiently by doubling the monetary limit for claims filed in New York City civil court.\", \"But the defeat of the voting and redistricting proposals represented yet another blow for a Democratic Party reeling from electoral losses in New York and Virginia and an unexpectedly tight governor\\u2019s race in New Jersey.\", \"Susan Lerner, the executive director of the civic watchdog group Common Cause New York and a proponent of all three initiatives, argued that the success of Republican and Conservative attacks highlighted the fragility of democracy itself.\", \"\\u201cThere was a strong anti-democratic push and the pro-democracy folks stayed home,\\u201d she said.\", \"But for New York\\u2019s Republicans, the initiatives represented an electoral target that played on national Republican themes \\u2014 unfounded fears of voter fraud in particular \\u2014 to get out the vote in a year when no congressional or statewide seats were being contested.\", \"\\u201cIn a year like this, you don\\u2019t have a built-in turnout around New York because there was no statewide office,\\u201d said Nick Langworthy, the state Republican Party chairman. \\u201cWhat we had to do was rally our base.\\u201d\", \"At the launch of the party\\u2019s \\u201cJust Say No\\u201d tour on Staten Island in October, Mr. Langworthy argued that the two voting-related ballot proposals \\u201cthreaten our democracy\\u201d and were akin to \\u201crolling out the red carpet for voter fraud.\\u201d\", \"Twenty states offer same-day voter registration. All require proof of residency, which was not included in the proposed amendment.\", \"Representative Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican who represents parts of Staten Island and Brooklyn, claimed at the appearance that Democrats hoped to \\u201ctilt the scale\\u201d in their favor, tying their efforts to a national voting rights bill and warning of ballot harvesting, a common subject of misinformation spread on social media.\", \"Similar performances played out across the state. Around the same time, the Conservative Party began running its ads.\", \"\\u201cHow corrupt are the politicians in Albany?\\u201d asked the narrator of the TV spot, which argued that the proposals were an \\u201cinvitation to fraud and a scam to rig the system.\\u201d\", \"Aside from the hard-charging efforts by the Republican and Conservative parties, opponents of the proposals benefited from outside dynamics, too.\", \"The first ballot proposal divided watchdog groups, because it appeared to diminish the power of minority parties.\", \"\\u201cProposition 1 on redistricting was an overreach by Democrats that heavily motivated the G.O.P. and wasn't backed by party energy or funds,\\u201d said John Kaehny, the executive director of the government reform group Reinvent Albany, which did not take a position on the proposal.\", \"The state Democratic Party spent no money directly backing the ballot proposals, according to the state senator who sponsored two of them and the party\\u2019s leader, Jay Jacobs.\", \"Mr. Jacobs said in an interview that the party was \\u201cnever asked by any of the stakeholders to do that,\\u201d an assertion that the senator, Michael Gianaris, called \\u201can outright lie.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gianaris, who leads the state\\u2019s Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, said the committee had spent more than $300,000 in support of the initiatives. Mr. Gianaris also shared an Oct. 20 email that one of his top aides sent to one of Mr. Jacobs\\u2019s top aides seeking the party\\u2019s help \\u201con email blasts, social and mail.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s NO ask for money for a campaign!\\u201d Mr. Jacobs texted The New York Times when asked about the email, arguing that the aide\\u2019s email did not amount to a request for money.\", \"Finally, as written, the ballot questions, which required voters to flip their ballots over to weigh in, were hard to understand, according to Common Cause and like-minded groups.\", \"The state attorney general\\u2019s office proposes the ballot\\u2019s wording, but the state Board of Elections has final say, said Douglas Kellner, the board\\u2019s co-chairman.\", \"\\u201cThe ballot language for 1, 3, and 4 was frankly impenetrable,\\u201d Ms. Lerner said of the three measures that went down to defeat.\", \"Perhaps the most powerful dynamic at work was the general anti-Democratic tilt of Tuesday\\u2019s election.\", \"Gerard Kassar, the Conservative Party chairman, said that he was on the phone with Mr. Langworthy at about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, and that by that point they had still not taken stock of all of their wins.\", \"\\u201cWe had a good night, to be honest with you,\\u201d Mr. Kassar said.\"]","href_hash":"8c0de2cc3cff11ecbe3d000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8c0de2cc3cff11ecbe3d000017025a03"}},
