She enjoys cooking, yes, but much of her culinary repertoire \\u2014 including a no-fuss stovetop brisket \\u2014 can be prepared relatively quickly. Assembling a loaf of challah, the briochelike Jewish bread coated with a soft brown egg wash and braided in a classic plait, is another undertaking entirely. There\\u2019s the physically demanding kneading. The hour of rising. The punching of the dough (arm workout No. 2). Another half-hour of rising. A small reprieve for the fun part \\u2014 braiding the dough and adding toppings to create something either herby or extra sweet \\u2014 followed by a third, hourlong rise. Only then does the loaf make it into the oven.\", \"But Hay\\u2019s favorite challah recipe \\u2014 the one that, after almost a decade of trial and error with other versions, she has crowned the best \\u2014 is well worth the substantial time commitment. For one, store-bought challah is rarely an appealing option; Orwashers in Manhattan, Hay admits, makes a pretty decent one, but most supermarket loaves don\\u2019t cut it. And among all the homemade challahs Hay has tried, this rendition, adapted from that of the Jewish American cooking icon Joan Nathan, has just the right amount of rich, indulgent egginess. \\u201cIt\\u2019s really kind of foolproof,\\u201d Hay says. \\u201cI think the eggs are the key.\\u201d\", \"Challah is, as in many Jewish households, a staple of her family\\u2019s Shabbat dinner. She bakes three loaves almost every week \\u2014 two for Friday night, and an extra for lunch on Saturday\\u00a0\\u2014 sometimes freezing an extra ball of dough to use the following Friday. And while her children usually help (Ruth, 8, and Solomon, 6, are both within the ideal challah-decorating, dough-punching age bracket), it\\u2019s no small feat, particularly on top of running her namesake clothing line, Batsheva. (The brand\\u2019s current projects include another collaborative collection, due in May, with the British brand Laura Ashley that will again combine the latter\\u2019s classic floral prints with Hay\\u2019s signature flowy, high-necked silhouettes, inspired in part by the traditional styles worn by some Jewish women.) But the recipe still lends itself to maintaining a reasonable work-life balance: \\u201cIf you have four hours where you\\u2019re going to be home,\\u201d Hay says, \\u201ceven if it\\u2019s on a Sunday, it is one of those things \\u2014 you can mix it up and let it rise while you answer some emails, you know?\\u201d\", \"Challah remains an essential element on Hay\\u2019s table during Hanukkah, which, as a child growing up in a more secular Jewish household in Queens, she cherished. (\\u201cIt was like Jewish Christmas. You got a lot of presents.\\u201d) It\\u2019s stayed her favorite, even as she\\u2019s become more observant of Orthodox traditions as an adult \\u2014 Hanukkah doesn\\u2019t hold as much religious importance as some other Jewish holidays\\u00a0\\u2014 and most years she strives to stick to the holiday\\u2019s typical menu, with varying levels of success. \\u201cI\\u2019ve tried making jelly doughnuts and they end up being really sad,\\u201d she says, but store-bought versions do tend to make an appearance, along with latkes and gelt. As for her Hanukkah challah, she opts for a round braid, as is customary for special occasions, and as always, she\\u2019s partial to the sweeter add-ons like cinnamon sugar or chocolate chips \\u2014 or, to appease her kids, the raisin fans of the family, \\u201csometimes I\\u2019ll do cinnamon and raisin, like a bagel kind of vibe,\\u201d she says. But either option is acceptable for the same reason those four hours of baking are truly worth it: The leftovers can be used the next morning to make the perfect French toast.\", \"(Apart from Hay\\u2019s additions, which are italicized, the below is a reproduction of the original recipe, which can also be found at New York Times Cooking.)\", \"Makes 2 loaves\", \"Ingredients:\", \"To finish:\", \"1. In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and the tablespoon of sugar in the lukewarm water; set aside for anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes, or until a bit foamy.\", \"2. Whisk the oil into the mixture, then beat in the 4 eggs, one at a time, with the remaining \\u00bd cup of sugar and the salt. Gradually add flour. When the dough holds together, it\\u2019s ready for kneading.\", \"3. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead until smooth. Clean out the bowl and grease it, then return the dough to the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until almost doubled in size. Dough may also rise in an oven that has been warmed to 150 degrees then turned off. Punch down dough, cover and let rise again in a warm place for another 30 minutes.\", \"4. Split the dough into two balls, and mix in the raisins if using. Braid the dough. (Nathan creates a six-strand braid, while Hay prefers three strands.) For a straight loaf, tuck the ends underneath the braid. For a circular loaf, twist the braid into a circle, pinching the ends together. Make a second loaf the same way. Place the braided loaves on a greased cookie sheet with at least 2 inches in between.\", \"5. Beat the remaining egg and brush it on the loaves. Let them rise for another hour. Add any toppings \\u2014 cinnamon and sugar, fenugreek and zaatar are all options.\", \"6. If baking immediately, preheat the oven to 375 degrees and brush the loaves again. Bake the loaves in the middle of the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden. Cool the loaves on a rack, and enjoy!\"]","href_hash":"f1e3a27852e211ec9720191e077c28eb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f1e3a27852e211ec9720191e077c28eb"}},
