Rhodes said he paid for the repairs that totaled about $400.\", \"The sheriff in his first term said he deeply regrets the mistake and has completed the required boating safety course and substance abuse treatment program that was part of the plea agreement.\", \"\\\"I should have said no and I didn't, and that's my responsibility,\\\" he told U.S. Magistrate Judge Camille Bibles, hearing his case. \\\"Not accepting responsibility was never an option for me.\\\"\", \"Bibles said she appreciated that he took responsibility for his actions and didn't try to use his position of authority to avoid punishment.
