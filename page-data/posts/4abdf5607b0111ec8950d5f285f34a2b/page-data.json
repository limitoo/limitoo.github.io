To date, one household member has returned a positive result and one has tested negative.\\\"\", \"The case is considered to be infectious from 16 January.\", \"As an interim measure the isolation time for all Covid-19 cases is being extended to 14 days, due to the increased infectiousness of Omicron.\", \"The period was previously 10 days.\", \"\\\"A similar change Is being applied for close contacts where all close contacts will now isolate for ten days.
