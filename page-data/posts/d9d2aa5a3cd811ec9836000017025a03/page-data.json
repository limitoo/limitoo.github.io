Another detailed the injuries of a sensitive claimant who ended up in hospital after they tried to end their life.\", \"\\\"It's really disgusting to be honest. They thought it was funny, but it's a breach of privacy,\\\" a member of the Snapchat group told RNZ.\", \"They decided to speak out after RNZ reported claimants and advocates were concerned about the way the agency handled sensitive information and ACC responded with assurances.\", \"\\\"When I read ACC's comments that it takes privacy seriously, I just knew I had to do something.\\\"\", \"Earlier this month RNZ reported the case of a man who was horrified to discover more than 90 ACC staff had accessed an old sensitive claim file more than 350 times since he'd closed it. The man believed his privacy and rights had been breached, but ACC said every login was justified.\", \"The call centre whistleblower said unethical access to claimants medical records was widespread among her colleagues.

They posted the details with a silly face emoji and the comment: \\\"Girl really went all out\\\".\", \"The whistleblower said privacy training for call centre staff was inadequate despite all of them having access to sensitive claims information.\", \"Contrary to what many believed there were no special measures to protect medical records belonging to sensitive claims, and once the identity of the caller was verified, call centre staff could see all their claims and view all their medical records, they said.\", \"\\\"All we have to do is go into the documents tab and literally everything is sitting in there.

Since being informed we have moved swiftly and stood down 12 staff and begun an immediate investigation into this matter.\\\"\", \"The internal investigation would determine whether there were more staff involved and if more claimants, other than the athlete, had had their privacy breached, Tully said.\", \"The athlete, whose name, email and injuries were shared, had been contacted.\", \"\\\"Naturally they were surprised and had some questions of us. We've been able to answer those and we shared with the person what was disclosed and they are satisfied with our response to date.\\\"\", \"He admitted the athlete's privacy had been beached and the employees who shared claimants' injuries breached the agency's Code of Conduct.

It is critical that ACC has enough appropriately trained staff with access to the right information available to manage all aspects of a survivor's claim in order to provide them with the support they require.\", \"\\\"I am assured that ACC takes the privacy of the information it holds very seriously and all information provided to ACC by clients and providers is handled with care and respect,\\\" Sepuloni said.\", \"\\\"ACC is working to determine whether it needs to change or improve its systems and processes with respect to access to sensitive claims information. How ACC collects, secures, uses and shares information is governed by the Privacy Act and the Health Information Privacy Code.\\\"\", \"Access to sensitive claims files should be severely restricted to a small number of staff, van Velden said.\", \"\\\"I do not see how over 1400 people in ACC need access to information that provides ongoing trauma to people who have reached out to the Sensitive Claims Unit. A smaller group of people will find it much easier to keep people's information private.\\\"\", \"She said the \\\"despicable\\\" behaviour of call centre staff sharing private and sensitive information amongst themselves was proof change is needed. \\\"There cannot be a good reason why so many people need to have access to that information.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"d9d2aa5a3cd811ec9836000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d9d2aa5a3cd811ec9836000017025a03"}},
