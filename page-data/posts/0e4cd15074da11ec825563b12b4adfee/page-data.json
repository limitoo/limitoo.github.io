Kennedy International Airport in New York to travel to San Juan, Puerto Rico, prosecutors said. Their morning flight was delayed for more than four hours, and during that time the women allegedly ordered nine alcoholic drinks, according to a letter U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace sent U.S. Magistrate Judge Vera M. Scanlon on Thursday requesting bail conditions.\\u00a0\", \"Upon arriving to their gate, agents reported that Zavala \\\"was having difficulty walking\\\" and Nixon smelled of alcohol, Breon's letter said. \\\"The defendants were belligerent, with one appearing to be visibly disoriented and possibly intoxicated, and another who was refusing to properly wear her mask,\\\" the indictment read.\", \"Several Delta employees allegedly determined that the trio shouldn't board the plane because of such behavior, and notified the women that they could rebook their flight later that same day.\\u00a0\", \"The women allegedly refused to leave the jetway and began yelling and cursing at the security officer who came to the scene for assistance, according to Breon's letter. Nixon is accused of removing the officer's radio and striking him repeatedly with it. When the flight's gate agent attempted to intervene, Zavala allegedly punched them in the face. The agent then called for help.\", \"The security officer fell to the ground and all three women allegedly hit and kicked him. Torres is accused of stepping on the officer's head and face, which caused bleeding.
