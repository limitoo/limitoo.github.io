The federal indictment alleged that Chauvin and three other fired officers deprived Floyd of his civil rights under color of law, meaning while acting in their capacity as police officers.\\u00a0\", \"Chauvin was accused in the federal case of willfully depriving Floyd of the constitutional right to be protected from illegal search and seizure, which includes the right to be free from unreasonable force by a police officer. It says Chauvin did so by pinning Floyd to the ground with a knee on his neck as he was handcuffed and not resisting, resulting in Floyd's death.\\u00a0\", \"Sentencing is expected at a later date. Prosecutors say they are asking for a 300-month sentence \\u2014 25 years \\u2014 to be served concurrently with Chauvin's state sentence. Chauvin will also have to pay restitution; the amount has yet to be determined.\", \"Chauvin previously pleaded not guilty to the charges. The change of plea hearing was submitted on the court's docket Monday and set for Wednesday morning in federal court in St. Paul.\\u00a0\", \"Chauvin also faced a separate federal indictment accusing him of\\u00a0holding a teenager down by the throat in 2017. As part of his plea Wednesday, that indictment will be dismissed, CBS Minnesota's Esme Murphy\\u00a0reported.\", \"The Justice Department declined to comment on the change of plea entry.\", \"The three other officers charged in the federal indictment, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, are also awaiting trial on state charges of aiding and abetting in Floyd's death.\", \"In April a jury found Chauvin guilty of all three counts he was facing in the death of George Floyd \\u2014 second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter \\u2014 for which he has been sentenced to 22 and 1/2 years in prison.\", \"Rob Legare contributed reporting.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"f143f8345dc511ecacdb476e3c46e28b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f143f8345dc511ecacdb476e3c46e28b"}},
