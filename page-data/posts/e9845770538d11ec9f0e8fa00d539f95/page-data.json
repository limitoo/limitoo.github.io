The number of announced job cuts in November fell to 14,875, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That's the lowest figure since May 1993.\", \"\\\"[I]t's no surprise job cuts are  at record lows. Employers are spread thin, planning best- and worst-case  scenarios in terms of COVID, while also contending with staff shortages  and high demand,\\\" Andrew Challenger, the company's senior vice president, said in a statement.\", \"Government figures released on Thursday also show unemployment claims \\u2014 a proxy for layoffs \\u2014 falling steadily. Some 222,000 claims for jobless aid were filed in the week ended November 27, the Department of Labor said. That's a small rise from the previous week's figures, which hit a 50-year low, but close to the typical weekly number before the COVID-19 pandemic hit last winter.\", \"Coming after months of strong hiring, the figures suggest that employers are eager to retain employees amid a broad shortage of workers and as millions of\\u00a0Americans quit their jobs.\", \"\\\"Just  as employers have a persistent demand for more labor, and certainly  holding on tight to their existing workforce, the pace of firings  continues to fall,\\\" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with  Bleakley Adisory Group, said in a report.\", \"Overall, 2 million Americans were receiving traditional jobless  benefits the week that ended November 20, down 107,000 from the week  before. The number  of Americans receiving some form of jobless aid, including from federal programs, peaked at more than 33  million in June 2020.\", \"The job market has rebounded strongly since the spring of 2020 when  the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses to close or cut hours and  kept many Americans at home as a health precaution. In March and April  last year, employers slashed more than 22 million jobs.\\u00a0\", \"But since last summer, unemployment claims have fallen more or less steadily as businesses reopen, bolstered by relief checks and enhanced unemployment benefits from the federal government. Companies now complain that they can't find workers to fill job  openings, which hit a near-record of 10.4 million in September.\", \"Still, even as the job market tightens, economists are wary about the spreading of new variants of the coronavirus. The highly transmissble Omicron variant could disrupt the economic rebound, some say.\", \"\\\"[R]enewed health concerns are a downside risk that may prevent people from returning to the  workforce over coming months,\\\" Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a note.\", \"The Associated Press contributed reporting.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"e9845770538d11ec9f0e8fa00d539f95"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e9845770538d11ec9f0e8fa00d539f95"}},
