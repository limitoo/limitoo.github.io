Eighteen of the 20 countries around the world that are reporting the most new cases per day, relative to their populations, are in Europe or the part of Central Asia that the W.H.O. includes in its European region.\", \"New reported cases reached a record high in Germany on Wednesday, when the nation recorded 33,949 new infections in a 24-hour period. Only 67 percent of the country is fully vaccinated.\", \"Covid-related deaths in Europe are also increasing.\", \"\\u201cIf we stay on this trajectory, we could see another half a million Covid-19 deaths in Europe and Central Asia by the first of February next year,\\u201d Dr. Kluge said.\", \"The surge in infections, driven by the Delta variant, is affecting all age groups, Dr. Kluge said, but it has been deadliest among older people. Three-quarters of those who died last week were over 65, and most were not fully vaccinated, he said.\", \"Hospitals are being flooded with Covid patients across the region; in 43 of the 53 countries, hospitals are likely to face high to extreme stress in the next three months, the W.H.O. projected.\", \"Dr. Kluge said the virus was surging because precautions like mask-wearing were relaxed and because too few people have been vaccinated.\", \"Eight countries in the region have vaccinated more than 70 percent of their populations, but two have managed to immunize less than 10 percent, he said. Hospital admission rates were high, he said, in the countries where vaccination rates were low.\", \"Outbreaks have also appeared in unvaccinated populations in countries with relatively high rates of vaccination. In Italy, which has fully vaccinated 72 percent of its population and recently imposed stringent national rules to encourage workers to get vaccinated, the city of Trieste became a hotbed of infections two weeks after thousands of vaccine skeptics gathered to protest the new rules.\", \"Dr. Kluge also emphasized the continued need for basic precautions like mask-wearing, social distance and good indoor ventilation, and he took note of projections that 188,000 lives could be saved in Europe in the next three months if 95 percent of the population wore masks.\", \"\\u201cWe must change our tactics, from reacting to surges of Covid-19 to preventing them from happening in the first place,\\u201d Dr. Kluge said.\"]","href_hash":"cfb1a40a3d9011ec8e28000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cfb1a40a3d9011ec8e28000017025a03"}},
