Every week, it seems, there\\u2019s a new creative director or partner or officer of some kind.\", \"Just this month, the rapper Cardi B announced that she was joining Playboy as its first creative director in residence. (She is also a partner in Whipshots, a vodka-infused whipped cream that was released in early December.)\", \"She joins a growing list of famous brand associates that includes Emily Ratajkowski, partner and creative director at Loops Beauty (face masks); Dakota Johnson, co-creative director and investor at Maude (sexual health and wellness products); Prince Harry, chief impact officer at BetterUp (employee coaching); Kendall Jenner, creative director at Fwrd (an online boutique); Drew Barrymore, creative director at Garnier (hair care and skin care); Jennifer Aniston, chief creative officer at Vital Proteins (supplements); and ASAP Rocky, guest artistic director at PacSun (clothing and accessories).\", \"Once upon a time, famous people signed on to brands as their \\u201cfaces\\u201d or \\u201cspokespeople.\\u201d With the rise of social media marketing came the flood of \\u201cambassadors.\\u201d Now, a corporate title once reserved for the heads of fashion houses or the artistic leads at advertising firms is being tacked onto the r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9s of actors, singers and models.\", \"The titles have become so common that when Pete Davidson, the very datable comedian, and HoYeon Jung, a star of the Netflix series \\u201cSquid Game,\\u201d took over Calvin Klein\\u2019s Instagram account this week, many people assumed an announcement about their roles was coming. (A representative for Calvin Klein would not comment on that.)\", \"\\u201cWhen you\\u2019re the face of something or a brand ambassador, you\\u2019re representing them,\\u201d said Susan Douglas, a professor of communication and media at the University of Michigan. \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t suggest particular talent or input. But \\u2018creative director\\u2019 suggests that you have a set of executive or creative skills. It burnishes your brand as not just being a pretty face.\\u201d\", \"Some of the companies that celebrities have joined are not household names. They\\u2019re not Capital One (where Jennifer Garner and Samuel L. Jackson are spokespeople) or Nespresso (George Clooney, brand ambassador).\", \"But that can actually be a benefit, Dr. Douglas said. \\u201cThese niche companies don\\u2019t want to seem like Procter & Gamble,\\u201d Dr. Douglas said. \\u201c\\u2018We\\u2019ve really tapped into people, we know what they want.\\u2019 Authenticity is the coin of the realm right now.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s a two-way validation system. \\u201cThe star becomes a stand-in for the brand, and the qualities of the brand mirror or enhance the qualities we associate with the star,\\u201d said Andrea McDonnell, an associate professor of communication at Providence College.\", \"In the case of Cardi B and Playboy, Dr. McDonnell said, \\u201cher personal brand revolves around empowered sexuality. She\\u2019s a female coming into what has been historically and by definition a male-centric space.\\u201d\", \"Bringing her on as a creative director, she said, could \\u201cpush the brand in a different direction, expand the audience and maybe do a little damage control.\\u201d (In a clip from A&E Network\\u2019s upcoming documentary series about Hugh Hefner and Playboy released last week, Holly Madison, who lived in the Playboy mansion and was one of Mr. Hefner\\u2019s girlfriends, says she \\u201cbroke under the pressure\\u201d of being in the house.)\", \"It is not clear to what extent these new roles are vanity titles. Some celebrities are bound to be more involved than others.\", \"Eva Goicochea, the founder and chief executive of Maude, a sexual health and wellness company, said that Ms. Johnson joined in \\u201can investor-adviser deal.\\u201d A project on which they\\u2019ve teamed with the Museum of Sex is planned for next spring.\", \"Ms. Goicochea said that she hadn\\u2019t previously intended on working with anyone famous. \\u201cA lot of people think that it\\u2019s like Midas,\\u201d she said, referring to the king who turned everything he touched into gold. \\u201cThat they\\u2019ll post about you and suddenly you\\u2019ll be raking in cash. Maybe in the short term. But you can\\u2019t be myopic about the potential and the downsides.\\u201d\", \"For one, she said, stars are people, and they could say the wrong thing while representing the company. But there is also the risk that the brand begins to revolve around one person. \\u201cIt starts to become about them and less about the topic,\\u201d Ms. Goicochea said.\", \"Her advice to any business courting a celebrity or being courted by one? Vet the person thoroughly. After all, maintaining a positive and distinctive public image \\u2014 both as a person and as a company \\u2014 is only becoming more important.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s a battle for visibility,\\u201d Dr. Douglas said. \\u201cWhat is the scarcest resource? People\\u2019s attention. You have to constantly have your name out there or people forget about you.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"27217c7b5c3a11ec9bc11fe9ddd7fc61"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"27217c7b5c3a11ec9bc11fe9ddd7fc61"}},
