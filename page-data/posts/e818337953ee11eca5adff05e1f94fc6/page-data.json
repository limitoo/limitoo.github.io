While many on social media stated that these incidents were connected, Bouchard stated that this was not the case.\", \"Another of these rumors included a video circulating online, posted by a student inside the school, that purported to show the suspected shooter attempting to impersonate a sheriff in order to enter a classroom. However, Bouchard said that this was most likely an undercover officer trying to calm the students down, adding that authorities do not believe the shooter ever attempted to enter a classroom.\", \"However, Bouchard did add that the suspect had in fact posted a picture of his weapon, a SIG Sauer 9 mm semiautomatic pistol, online before the post was later deleted.\", \"Social media has come under scrutiny as investigators struggle to understand how the suspect managed to fly under the radar for so long. In particular, criticism was aimed at the high school, as it was revealed that school officials had spoken to the suspect and his parents regarding concerning behavior just hours before the massacre.\", \"Bouchard told reporters that \\\"no information\\\" on the suspect's suspicious behavior had been relayed to local authorities or the sheriff's office.\", \"\\\"School leaders should work with their local law enforcement officials to identify and prosecute, to the fullest extent of the law, those who make threats of violence against their school communities,\\\" Rice continued.\"]","href_hash":"e818337953ee11eca5adff05e1f94fc6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e818337953ee11eca5adff05e1f94fc6"}},
