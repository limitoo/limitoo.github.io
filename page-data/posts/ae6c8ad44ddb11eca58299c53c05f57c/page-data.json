Half of the colony died during the winter from 1620 to 1621, as it was too late in the year to plant crops.\", \"In the spring of 1621, the colonists were taught how to grow corn and other vegetables by the local Wampanoag Indians, who also showed the Pilgrims how to cook corn as well as cranberries and squash. They were also taught how to master hunting and fishing.\", \"The NMAI explains: \\\"When the English decided to establish a colony there in the 1600s, the Wampanoag already had a deep understanding of their environment. They maintained a reciprocal relationship with the world around them.\", \"\\\"As successful hunters, farmers, and fishermen who shared their foods and techniques, they helped the colonists survive in a strange new place,\\\" the museum says.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1940136/aerial-view-thanksgiving-meal.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">An aerial view of people sharing a Thanksgiving meal at a table.

Wampanoag Chief Massasoit and his tribe brought venison.\", \"The NMAI says: \\\"The first Thanksgiving was just the beginning of a long history of interactions between American Indians and immigrants...the meal that is ingrained in the American consciousness represents much more than a simple harvest celebration. It was a turning point in history.\\\"\", \"The first Thanksgiving was followed by an extended period of injustice and conflict between Native Americans and Europeans. Many Native Americans see Thanksgiving as a \\\"National Day of Mourning,\\\" the U.S. embassy website says.\", \"The museum explains: \\\"Sharing agricultural knowledge was one aspect of early American Indian efforts to live side by side with Europeans. As relationships with the newcomers grew into competitions for land and resources, the groups were not always successful in their efforts to coexist.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1940145/jlm-ferris-painting-depicting-first-thanksgiving.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A painting by J.L.M.

Roosevelt.\", \"Following pressure from the Retail Dry Goods Association, in 1939 Roosevelt moved the date of Thanksgiving to the penultimate Thursday in November.\", \"That year, retailers were concerned about the potential negative impact on sales due to a shorter Christmas shopping period, since Thanksgiving landed on November 30 in 1939.\", \"Dozens of states made declarations similar to Roosevelt's Thanksgiving date proclamation, while others opted to keep the holiday as the last Thursday in November.\", \"After two years of different states observing Thanksgiving on one of two dates (either the penultimate or final Thursday in November), in 1941 Congress passed legislation that officially established Thanksgiving as the fourth Thursday of every November.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1940135/basket-pumpkins-squash-corn.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A basket with pumpkins, squash and corn surrounded by autumn leaves.
