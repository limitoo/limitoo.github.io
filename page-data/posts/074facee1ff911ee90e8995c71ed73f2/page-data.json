But if you need to head outside into the sizzling conditions, here's some expert advice:\", \"Dress for the weather: The CDC suggests wearing \\\"lightweight, loose-fitting clothing\\\" in order to stay as cool as possible outdoors. So if you're planning an elaborate concert outfit\\u00a0\\u2014 or any other activities \\u2014 keep this in mind.\\u00a0\", \"Take it slow: If you're not used to working or exercising in a hot environment, be sure to pace yourself. \\\"If exertion in the heat makes your heart pound and leaves you gasping for breath, STOP all activity,\\\" the CDC's website warns. \\\"Get into a cool area or into the shade, and rest, especially if you become lightheaded, confused, weak, or faint.\\\"\", \"Stay hydrated: No matter your activity level, drink plenty of fluids, the CDC says, and don't wait until you're thirsty. Water is a good option, or a sports drink can help replenish salt and minerals lost through sweat. \\\"Stay away from very sugary or alcoholic drinks \\u2014 these actually cause you to lose more body fluid,\\\" the organization adds.\\u00a0\", \"Wear sunscreen: Don't skip sunscreen, since \\\"sunburn affects your body's ability to cool down and can make you dehydrated,\\\" the CDC notes. A broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher is\\u00a0your best defense against the sun's harmful rays.\\u00a0\", \"Heat-related illnesses include a spectrum of issues, including sunburn, heat rash, heat cramps, heat stroke and heat exhaustion.\", \"Heat rash is a red, stinging rash that develops when you're hot and sweaty. \\\"It's most likely to show up in areas where sweat gets trapped, like inside your elbows and behind your knees,\\\" the Cleveland Clinic notes.\", \"Heat cramps \\u2014 painful muscle cramps that can strike when you're exercising in hot weather \\u2014 can develop when you sweat so much that your body loses essential salts and fluids.\", \"Heat exhaustion, which occurs when your body can't cool itself through sweating, can progress to heat stroke if left untreated.

Move the person to a cooler place, try lowering their temperature with cooler clothes or a cool bath, and don't give the person additional liquid to drink.\\u00a0\", \"For heat exhaustion, moving to a cooler place with cooler clothes can help, in addition to sipping water.
