the only way to know what her future will look like is to compare her to other childhood onset HSP sufferers.\", \"\\\"It's very unfortunate, there is just more spasticity and weakness, and quite possibly early death.\\\"\", \"He says\\u00a0because of the rarity, there is no way of providing a timeline on Tallulah's decline\\u00a0as it varies so greatly between cases and\\u00a0there isn't
