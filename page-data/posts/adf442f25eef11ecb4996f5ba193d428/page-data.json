The child told his dad there was \\\"something on the way\\\", which Kris took little notice of.\", \"That is, until the UberEats delivery driver called his wife.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"First of all I thought it was $139. And then I really looked at it and it was $1,139 and we almost had a bloody heart attack,\\\" The Guardian reports him saying. \\\"I flicked through the screen about 30 times. That\\u2019s how long the order was, it was like 99 cakes.\\\"\", \"Kris told the outlet he had \\\"steam coming out of my ears\\\" in disbelief his son had ordered a large number of cakes as well as tubs of his favourite gelato.\", \"The child got himself a birthday cake despite his birthday not being until January, which Kris believes shows his son was planning ahead.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We order stuff off UberEats every day, and he\\u2019s obviously seen us do it all the time, but he\\u2019s never done it and submitted it. $1,200 later, it was a big shock to the system.\\\"\", \"The Guardian says the order was sent to the Newtown Fire Station where Kris works and last made an order. Those on duty accepted it and had to take everything out of their fridge to make room.\\u00a0\", \"Once UberEats was told what had happened, the service refunded the family.\", \"Kris said he would have expected something to alert UberEats that there was an issue.\\u00a0\", \"He originally told Christian that Santa wasn't coming as a result of his actions, but when UberEats refunded them, he was \\\"back in the good books\\\".\"]","href_hash":"adf442f25eef11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"adf442f25eef11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
