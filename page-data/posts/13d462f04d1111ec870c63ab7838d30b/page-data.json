A comprehensive beating?\", \"Probably. And that is what happened on Monday night in Tampa.\", \"The Buccaneers thrashed the Giants, 30-10, behind 307 passing yards from Tom Brady. Nothing went right for the Giants, who tied the score at 10-10 after they were gifted an interception in the first half but then watched the game get away.\", \"The Giants managed only 215 total yards, and gave up almost twice as many first downs (28) as they managed themselves (15).\", \"\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t do anything really well enough to win the game tonight,\\u201d Giants Coach Joe Judge said after the game. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t make mistakes with turnovers, penalties and mental errors. We\\u2019ve got to make sure we put our players in a better position through coaching. Got to make sure we have the opportunity to make plays.\\u201d\", \"Judge pointed the finger of blame in several directions, challenging both his team, his coaches and himself to be better. He spoke several times, in particular, of unspecified coaching failures.\", \"\\u201cYou guys can write that tonight,\\u201d Judge said. \\u201cPlayers have to execute. That is their job, right? It is our job to teach them. It\\u2019s their job to go out and execute.\", \"\\u201cBut we\\u2019ve got to make sure we put them in position to have success. That has to be consistent, by the way. So, you can go ahead and write that down. I\\u2019m not going to debate that.\\u201d\", \"While Judge hinted Monday\\u2019s result was personally and professionally disappointing, he declined to respond to direct questions about possible staffing changes.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve got to make sure we sit down tomorrow as a coaching staff and understand how we\\u2019ve got to play this game and give our players a chance to make plays,\\u201d he said.\", \"The Giants did not make many against the Bucs. Quarterback Daniel Jones was 23 for 38 for only 167 yards and threw two interceptions. No Giant ran for more than Saquon Barkley\\u2019s 25 yards.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s on me, that\\u2019s on us, to do better,\\u201d Jones said.\", \"Judge, who is in his first head coaching job after eight years as a Patriots assistant, talked about a long-term vision for the team. The Giants were 6-10 last season, their best record in four years. But at 3-7 after Monday night\\u2019s defeat, he seemed to acknowledge that many fans are beginning to get antsy.\", \"To those fans, Judge said: \\u201cI\\u2019m not asking you to be patient. That\\u2019s not your job. I\\u2019m telling you we\\u2019re going to put something on the field you\\u2019ll be proud of.\\u201d\", \"Much of the criticism has fallen on Jason Garrett, the offensive coordinator, and he was fired on Tuesday, the team announced. \", \"The Giants rank 25th in net yards per pass and 24th in yards per rush. The team\\u2019s defensive numbers, while not at the top of the league, are at least better.\", \"Jones had backed Garrett after the game. \\u201cI think we were prepared, I think we had a plan, and we didn\\u2019t execute it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI think we feel responsible as players.\", \"Asked if he had faith in Garrett, Judge had seemed more equivocal. \\u201cI have faith in all the people on our team,\\u201d he said, adding, \\u201cwe\\u2019ll make any move we need to going forward.\\u201d\", \"Asked directly if Garrett would keep his job, or at least his role, Judge had replied, \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to go into that right now.\\u201d\", \"For the Bucs, the news was much better. Improving to 7-3, the team seems to have a hammer lock on the N.F.C. South. The return of Rob Gronkowski (six catches for 71 yards) from a rib injury was also a plus.\", \"The Giants now face a short week before a home game against Philadelphia on Sunday. In addition to the specific challenge posed by the Eagles, a divisional rival, the Giants may have to deal with a stadium full of home fans who now have their coach\\u2019s permission to be out of patience.\", \"\\u201cWe have to do everything better,\\u201d Judge said.\"]","href_hash":"13d462f04d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"13d462f04d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}},
