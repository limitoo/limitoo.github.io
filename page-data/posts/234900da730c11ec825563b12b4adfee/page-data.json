Their water filtering alters the marine food chain and also the chemistry of the water around them.\", \"\\\"This is the last place in the world where we don't have marine invasive species,\\\" McCarthy said. \\\"So we [still] have an opportunity to protect it.\\\"\", \"Professor David Aldridge from the University of Cambridge explained: \\\"Antarctica's native species have been isolated for the last 15-30 million years.\\\"\", \"This makes invasive species one of the biggest threats to its biodiversity.
