By rights it should have started in 2009, when Barack Obama was president, Democrats controlled the Senate and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer \\u2014 her second cancer diagnosis in a decade. Ginsburg lived another 11 years, spectacularly beating the odds even after a third diagnosis in 2018. But in retrospect, nothing is clearer than that she should have resigned expeditiously after learning she had a cancer that has an average five-year survival rate of 10 percent.\", \"Ginsburg, who as Greenhouse notes was sometimes called the Thurgood Marshall of the women\\u2019s rights movement, was playing Russian roulette with the future of abortion rights and civil rights. If a majority of the justices overturns Roe v. Wade in the current Supreme Court term, Ginsburg\\u2019s death in 2020 will be the most immediate cause. Mitch McConnell and the Republican Senate played a key role, of course, by blocking the appointment of then-Judge Merrick Garland toward the end of Obama\\u2019s term and then confirming Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett. The vacancy created by Ginsburg\\u2019s death, however, was the crucial moment for a court on which Chief Justice John Roberts had migrated to the center in the interest of preserving the court\\u2019s institutional legitimacy.\", \"Greenhouse, who covered the Supreme Court for The New York Times for 30 years, from 1978 to 2008, is the acknowledged dean of living Supreme Court journalists. Her stated goal in \\u201cJustice on the Brink\\u201d is not analyzing Ginsburg\\u2019s choice to retain her seat but \\u201cchronicling the life of the Supreme Court from July 2020 through June 2021.\\u201d No one can recount judicial decisions as accessibly and intelligently as Greenhouse. She does an excellent job of describing the court\\u2019s jurisprudence during that year, interspersing short biographical observations of the justices and filling in useful background.\", \"The challenge the book faces, therefore, doesn\\u2019t derive from Greenhouse\\u2019s admirably clear account of the court\\u2019s business. It\\u2019s the unfortunate fact that, in the year under consideration, the most important news about the Supreme Court consisted of things that the court\\u2019s activist conservative majority did not do.\", \"True, in its so-called \\u201cshadow-docket\\u201d of responses to emergency applications, the Supreme Court repeatedly struck down by 5-to-4 votes Covid restrictions applying to religious worship when, in the majority\\u2019s view, secular functions were being exempted from the restrictions. The results troubled many liberals, even if those decisions did not have a transformative effect on either legal doctrine or, as far as is possible to determine, public health. The court also reached conservative decisions on voting rights and other issues.\", \"Yet none of these decisions is of historical importance even slightly comparable to the three major decisions reached by the justices in the year discussed by Greenhouse. With constitutional democracy itself on the line, and a sitting president outrageously denying the validity of the vote that would put him out of office, the Supreme Court did not overturn the valid and legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election, despite being invited to do so by Trump\\u2019s campaign lawyers. The court did not invalidate the Affordable Care Act, despite being asked to end Obamacare by Trump\\u2019s Department of Justice. And the court did not reverse 30-plus years of First Amendment precedent by creating a constitutional right to automatic exemptions from neutral, generally applicable laws, despite being expected to do so by just about every court watcher, myself included.\", \"To make Greenhouse\\u2019s challenge greater still, in all these important cases, Barrett voted with the \\u201cdon\\u2019t do it\\u201d side. By far her most important opinion since joining the court came in the crucial free exercise case Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, which dealt with whether a Catholic adoption agency was entitled to be exempt from regulations requiring it to treat gay adoptive parents like straight ones. Instead of providing the decisive vote for the exemption sought by the Catholic agency, Barrett wrote separately to question the idea of applying strict judicial scrutiny to all neutral, generally applicable laws that burden religion. This surprising, and thoughtful, opinion likely foreshadows the future direction of the law, to the evident frustration of Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. It means, almost certainly, that religious conservatives will not attain a victory that looked imminent \\u2014 because Barrett will not deliver it.\", \"Maybe because it\\u2019s hard to write a drama in which the villain hasn\\u2019t done anything terrible yet, Greenhouse makes an uncharacteristic misstep in a brief excursus that compares the new justice to the late Phyllis Schlafly. To be sure, Schlafly was an important figure in the early anti-abortion movement. But her anti-feminist crusade against women in the workplace sits oddly with Barrett\\u2019s lifelong pursuit of a full-time career as a law professor and judge while raising seven (no, that\\u2019s not a typo) children. The only motivation for the invocation of Schlafly seems to be that, as Greenhouse notes, she was the subject of a television mini-series in 2020, and that both were lawyers with large families. \\u201cForty years later, more than a few people looked at Amy Coney Barrett and saw Phyllis Schlafly,\\u201d Greenhouse writes, with no indication of who those people were. \\u201cAnd how could they not, given the similarity in the two women\\u2019s biographies?\\u201d This isn\\u2019t even guilt by association. It\\u2019s guilt by free association.\", \"As a result of covering the 2020-21 Supreme Court term, \\u201cJustice on the Brink\\u201d is quite literally a book about the highest court (and Barrett) being on the brink of potentially doing extreme things, like overturning Roe \\u2014 without actually having done them yet. If the book had been delayed a year and extended through June of 2022, it could have included what are likely to be profoundly consequential, dramatic moments.\", \"In the next half year, the court will decide what to do about a brilliant but dastardly Texas law that effectively bans abortion by enabling private parties but not the state to sue providers. The justices will take on the even bigger case of the Mississippi abortion law that outlaws abortion after 15 weeks\\u2019 gestation, also in direct contradiction to Supreme Court precedent. By closing the book\\u2019s action in June 2021, Greenhouse precludes herself from doing more than setting the stage for the Mississippi law. The Texas abortion law doesn\\u2019t even get a mention, presumably because it didn\\u2019t go into effect until September 2021.\", \"Barrett\\u2019s appointment very well could turn out to be the springboard for the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. The court would then face a legitimacy challenge unmatched in more than a generation. Court-packing, which gets only a compressed discussion in the book, could become a central Democratic preoccupation. The political and constitutional fights that would follow an overruling of Roe could shape national politics in other important ways. The Roe decision itself, after all, contributed to the realignment of the American political order by underwriting a new coalition of Protestant evangelicals and Catholics, groups once implacably opposed.\", \"If some or all of this drama occurs in the months and years ahead, one can only be comforted by the knowledge that Linda Greenhouse will be here to write about it. \\u201cJustice on the Brink\\u201d will have been prologue. The action \\u2014 terrifying in its prospect \\u2014 lies ahead.\"]","href_hash":"85345bcf40c511ec86a5336d99224f30"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"85345bcf40c511ec86a5336d99224f30"}},
