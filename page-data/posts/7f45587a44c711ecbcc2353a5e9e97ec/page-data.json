restrictions will be eased for those fully vaccinated.\", \"The milestone was initially expected to come on November 19, but it is expected Queensland will hit the target early as early as Sunday afternoon.\\u00a0\", \"Based on the most recent figures, 81.7\\u00a0per cent of Queenslanders aged 16 years or older have received one shot of a COVID vaccine and 69.9\\u00a0per cent are now fully vaccinated.\", \"When the state reaches 80 per cent double dose, or December 17,\\u00a0restaurants and cafes, nightclubs and bars, cinemas, festivals and theme parks will no longer have density limits for fully-vaccinated venues.\", \"Weddings will be unrestricted, as long as everyone attending is fully vaccinated.\", \"Double-vaccinated people will also be able to visit aged care facilities, disability services and hospitals\\u00a0and loved ones in prison.\", \"However, none of these freedoms will apply to those who are not double-vaccinated.\", \"Unveiling Queensland's roadmap last month, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said lifting restrictions\\u00a0was a reward for Queenslanders who had taken public health advice.\", \"\\\"That is good news for families to be reunited for Christmas,\\\" she said.\", \"However, Ms Palaszczuk\\u00a0has asked people not to start making their way into Queensland just yet.\", \"\\\"I will let you know,\\\" she said on Thursday.\", \"\\\"Police have to do a lot of operational things when we reach that milestone so that information will come from me.\\\"\", \"<img

vaccine rollout.(ABC News: Michael Lloyd)</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What does this mean for interstate travellers?</div>\", \"Everyone entering Queensland must be double-vaccinated, with their second vaccine at least two weeks before entering the state.\", \"If you're coming\\u00a0from an interstate hotspot, or have been to one in the previous 14 days, several factors will determine whether you can enter and if you have to hotel quarantine.\", \"If you have been to a COVID hotspot in Australia 14 days prior to arrival, you must arrive by air.\\u00a0\", \"Along with being fully vaccinated, you must\\u00a0have proof of a negative TGA-approved COVID test within the previous 72 hours.\", \"You must then undergo quarantine at home for 14 days before going\\u00a0out into\\u00a0the Queensland community.\", \"If you do not meet these criteria, you must quarantine at what the roadmap calls a \\\"government-nominated facility\\\" for 14 days.\", \"If you want to enter Queensland from an area in Australia that's not a COVID hotspot, and you haven't been to a hotspot in the 14 days before\\u00a0your arrival, you can enter Queensland unrestricted and with no quarantine requirement.\", \"You will\\u00a0need to provide a negative TGA-approved COVID\\u00a0test taken within the previous 72 hours and complete any necessary documentation.\\u00a0\", \"Ms D'Ath said interstate travellers would be able to apply for a border pass as soon as Queensland hit\\u00a0the 70 per cent\\u00a0target.\", \"\\\"If you can meet all that criteria, the border pass will be automatic so you won't have to wait one, two, three days to get that approval,\\\" Ms D'Ath said.\", \"\\\"So when we hit that 70 per cent mark \\u2026 people can start booking their flights, going off and getting their [COVID-19] test and waiting for their negative result.\", \"\\\"Once they've got all that information \\u2013 they've got their vaccination status, their negative test and their flights booked \\u2014\\u00a0they can go onto the border pass system and they'll be able to put all that in.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What about international travel?</div>\", \"Not much is changing here.\", \"If you arrive to Queensland on a direct flight from overseas, you must quarantine for 14 days in a government-nominated facility.\", \"These arrivals will be subject to Queensland's international air arrivals cap.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b226e2348c35e29afb544fe243709a53\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> If you arrive to Queensland in a direct flight from overseas, you still need to undergo hotel quarantine.(ABC News: Michael Rennie)</div>\", \"If you do not catch a direct flight and you spend time in another Australian jurisdiction and want to enter Queensland before 14 days have passed since your arrival to Australia, you must quarantine at a government-nominated facility\\u00a0until 14 days have passed since your arrival to Australia.\", \"\\\"Safe travel zone\\\" arrangements will remain unchanged and quarantine-free.\", \"Currently, the only country in a

per cent double-dose.\", \"At 80 per cent, people who have been in a hotspot interstate can enter Queensland by road or by air, provided they are fully vaccinated and have tested negative for the virus in the 72 hours before arrival.\", \"If those criteria are not met, they must quarantine for 14 days at a government-nominated facility.\", \"People arriving from areas not classified as hotspots will face no restrictions or quarantine requirement \\u2014 as long as they haven't been to a hotspot in the 14 days prior to arrival.\", \"As for international arrivals, people can catch a direct flight to Queensland if they are fully vaccinated Australian citizens or permanent residents, with a negative COVID test result in the 72 hours before arrival.\", \"Outside of these limits, home quarantine will be required.
