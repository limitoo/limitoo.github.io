Its demographics are generally linked to lower-than-average Covid-19 vaccination rates.\", \"But the county, which is along the border with Mexico, has an immunization rate that ranks seventh out of the state\\u2019s 58 counties, the highest coverage level in Southern California.\", \"Imperial County\\u2019s surprisingly high demand for vaccinations has been a mystery for several months, as CalMatters first reported. Some experts cautioned that the numbers may have been boosted by Americans who live in Mexico crossing the border to get their shots.\", \"Still, the level of vaccine coverage in Imperial County \\u2014 74 percent of all residents are reported to be fully immunized, compared with 64 percent statewide \\u2014 is apparently high enough to have kept major Covid-19 surges at bay this year.\", \"Before the vaccines, Imperial County had been battered by the coronavirus. Even now, because of the severity of the outbreaks it suffered in 2020, Imperial County has lost a higher share of its population to Covid-19 than anywhere else in the state.\", \"But while the San Joaquin Valley, which is demographically similar, has endured a seemingly endless onslaught of Covid-19 spikes in 2021, Imperial County has been largely spared. And for that, experts credit the shots.\", \"Dr. Timothy Brewer, an infectious-disease expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, said he thought that Imperial County might have embraced vaccines in part because of the horror its residents dealt with last year.\", \"With one in five people in the county having tested positive for the coronavirus at some point during the pandemic, almost everyone probably knows a family member, friend or colleague who has gotten the virus \\u2014 if they haven\\u2019t had it themselves.\", \"\\u201cThey were hit early, and they were hit hard, and it\\u2019s possible that because of that, people recognize the importance of getting vaccinated,\\u201d Brewer told me. \\u201cThis wasn\\u2019t an abstract problem.\\u201d\", \"Covid-19 hospitalizations in Imperial County have recently begun to inch upward, but it\\u2019s hard to know whether that will continue or for how long, particularly given the emergence of the Omicron variant. And it\\u2019s not yet clear how high demand for booster shots will turn out to be in the county.\", \"On a recent weekday, I drove two hours east from coastal San Diego to El Centro, a town of about 44,000 people and the capital of Imperial County.\", \"El Centro is essentially how you would imagine a middle-class desert community \\u2014 plenty of strip malls and mud-colored buildings with flat roofs. But there was no doubt that agriculture was the main game here.\", \"Alongside the highway were hay bales and tractors to tend to the rows of crops stretching to the horizon. Tracts of multistory homes looked out not on parks but plowed fields.\", \"Joe Mathews, a columnist for Z\\u00f3calo Public Square, recently wrote about unusually high vaccination rates in Imperial Valley as well as in Salinas Valley, another agricultural center. He argued that an unlikely alliance between growers, labor groups, local governments and community advocates helped get people quickly immunized.\", \"In Imperial County, there was widespread collaboration to try to spread the word about the vaccines, said Rosyo Ramirez, deputy director for the community health division of the county\\u2019s public health department.\", \"The health department partnered with local clinics and other community organizations to administer shots, opening pop-up sites at churches, farms, hospitals and the U.S.-Mexico border, she said.\", \"\\u201cPublic health didn\\u2019t do this alone. It was a community effort,\\u201d she told me.\", \"The effect has been a stunning bucking of trends. In Imperial County, the vaccination rate for Latinos is almost 20 points higher than it is statewide. The vaccination rate for people between the ages of 18 and 49 in the county also far exceeds California\\u2019s overall.\", \"\\u201cThe demographic most represented in Imperial County, which is young adult Latinos, has really embraced getting vaccinated, which is terrific,\\u201d Brewer told me.\", \"For more:\", \"Los Angeles will elect a new mayor next year in a contest with the highest stakes in decades.\", \"Brown-butter orzo with butternut squash.\", \"Today\\u2019s tip comes from Mike McLaughlin, a reader who lives in New York:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.
