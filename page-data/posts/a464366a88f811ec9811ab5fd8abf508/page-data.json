She starts March 21.\", \"Nicanor, 41, has been executive director of the Rice Design Alliance at Rice University\\u2019s School of Architecture in Houston since 2017 and she spent several years in various roles at the Guggenheim Museum in New York.\", \"\\u201cShe has a deep understanding of collections and museums and strong scholarship,\\u201d said the Smithsonian secretary, Lonnie G. Bunch III, in a telephone interview. \\u201cShe talked a lot about design as an equalizer that shapes lives.\\u201d\", \"Nicanor steps into a position held by Caroline Baumann, who in 2020 was abruptly forced to resign amid allegations of impropriety, which prompted seven trustees to quit in protest, one of whom cut the museum out of her will. Baumann accused the Smithsonian of sexism. Later that year, former employees and board members of the Smithsonian\\u2019s National Museum of African Art complained that it \\u201chas recruited, retained and promoted a predominantly White staff.\\u201d\", \"The dismissal of Ms. Baumann was seen by some in the museum world as part of a troubling pattern of removing strong female cultural leaders, namely Olga Viso, who in 2017 left her post amid controversy as executive director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis; Laura Raicovich, who in 2018 was forced to step down as executive director of the Queens Museum; and Helen Molesworth, who in 2018 was pushed out as chief curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.\", \"Nicanor, in a telephone interview, sounded clear-eyed about the trials of the current moment. \\u201cThe last couple of years have brought a lot of turbulence to the cultural sector and museums in particular,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe just have to realize that museums are not neutral spaces.\", \"\\u201cWe have to bring more context,\\u201d Nicanor continued. \\u201cEven though it\\u2019s a very difficult time to do that, I think I have to do it and it\\u2019s an important thing to do.\\u201d\", \"Bunch said he has made issues of diversity, equity and inclusion central to the Smithsonian across its 19 museums and galleries. (Nicanor is the second Hispanic person in a week to be named by the Smithsonian as a museum director; Jorge Zamanillo, the chief executive of a community-based Miami history museum, was just appointed founding director of the new National Museum of the American Latino.)\", \"Bunch said that this priority would be integral to Nicanor\\u2019s mandate, as well. \\u201cWe want to make sure the Cooper Hewitt reaches an inclusive audience that is not just local but also global,\\u201d he said.\", \"He added that he was especially encouraged by Nicanor\\u2019s history at the Guggenheim, where between 2003 and 2013 she held several positions, including associate curator of architecture and urbanism and co-curator of the BMW Guggenheim Lab, a traveling think tank.\", \"\\u201cYou want someone who understands culture in New York,\\u201d Bunch said.\", \"While Nicanor was born in Barcelona and raised and educated in Madrid \\u2014 her bachelor\\u2019s degree is in art and architectural history and theory from the Aut\\u00f3noma University \\u2014 she earned her master\\u2019s degree in museum and curatorial studies at New York University. \\u201cNew York has been my home for many years.\\u201d\", \"With creative parents \\u2014 her father is a filmmaker and her mother is an intellectual property lawyer in the arts \\u2014 Nicanor said she has always been fascinated by \\u201chow things are made, how design affects the interaction you have with the world around you.\\u201d\", \"In thinking about the role of the Cooper Hewitt, Nicanor said she wants to advance the museum\\u2019s digital component and to connect with national design policy, \\u201cwhat it means to talk about design in the larger context.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThat means not just exhibiting beautiful cups of tea,\\u201d she added, \\u201cbut also explaining the infrastructure bill.\\u201d\", \"In recent years, the Cooper Hewitt has also covered a broad range of timely subjects, including the ways design and technology have transformed the lives of people with different physical, cognitive and sensory abilities; how designers have forged connections with nature, and, most recently, design responses to global pandemics.\", \"The museum\\u2019s Fifth Avenue mansion has long been a challenging space in which to show contemporary design and to project a future forward sensibility (the museum aimed to counter its fusty image with a renovation in 2014). But while \\u201cit\\u2019s certainly not your traditional white cube,\\u201d Nicanor said, the building also offers opportunities.\", \"\\u201cDesign tells the story of tradition and innovation and that building does both,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to make me have to work harder at bringing people in, to make them realize it\\u2019s not just the building, it\\u2019s the ideas that are inside.\\u201d\", \"Before Houston, Nicanor served as inaugural director of the Norman Foster Foundation in Madrid and was a curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in the design, architecture and digital department.\", \"Despite her previous leadership roles, Nicanor will be operating on a more high-profile stage at the Cooper Hewitt, which has \\u200b\\u200b86 employees, an annual budget of more than $15 million and a collection of about 215,000 objects.\", \"She will also have responsibility for the museum\\u2019s programming, in addition to overseeing the annual National Design Awards and the Cooper Hewitt\\u2019s 125th anniversary celebrations.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a bigger ship to move and bigger ships turn more slowly,\\u201d Nicanor said. \\u201cBut there are also a lot of advantages to being part of that network.\\u201d\", \"She will also have the burden of fundraising, given that the Cooper Hewitt receives far less taxpayer support, as a percentage of its budget, than do the Smithsonian\\u2019s other organizations.\", \"But Nicanor said she is comfortable cultivating donors. At Rice, she directed fundraising, operations and finance; in 2019, the Smithsonian said, her team achieved the highest fundraising record in the organization\\u2019s 50-year history.\", \"Nicanor also has experience with prioritizing equity. The Rice Design Alliance\\u2019s publication, \\u201cCite: The Architecture and Design Review of Houston,\\u201d has partnered with Beyond the Built Environment, an advocacy group, to aim for more diverse coverage. The Design Alliance also works closely with the Houston chapter of the National Organization of Minority Architects (NOMA), Nicanor said.\", \"As a woman in the hierarchical, male-dominated museum world, Nicanor said she has personal experience with confronting inequity.\", \"\\u201cI know firsthand what the issues in museums are in terms of diversity and recognition and visibility,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s something that is super important to me, because I\\u2019ve lived that myself.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a464366a88f811ec9811ab5fd8abf508"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a464366a88f811ec9811ab5fd8abf508"}},
