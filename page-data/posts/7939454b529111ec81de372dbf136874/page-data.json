Crouched on the bare wooden floor of his shabby apartment in 1990 New York City, he listens as Stephen Sondheim leaves a message \\u2014 instant balm to his battered artist\\u2019s soul.\", \"\\u201cJon? Steve Sondheim here,\\u201d the voice says in Lin-Manuel Miranda\\u2019s biomusical \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!,\\u201d and it really is Sondheim\\u2019s voice we hear, offering a bit of badly needed praise for the prodigiously talented, profoundly discouraged Larson.\", \"Sondheim scripted that voice mail for the film himself, and goodness knows he\\u2019d had decades of practice, offering just the right words to buoy the spirits of Larson and countless other young artists. When Sondheim died on Nov. 26 at 91, the American stage lost not only a composer and lyricist nonpareil but also its longtime encourager-in-chief.\", \"The story of his own early tutelage under Oscar Hammerstein II has been told and retold, but much less known \\u2014 at least outside professional theater \\u2014 is the rigorous dedication with which Sondheim passed that tradition on.\", \"As a mentor, as a letter writer, as an audience member who showed up far beyond Broadway to witness new work, he quietly, faithfully nurtured generations of theater makers.\", \"Miranda, who first met Sondheim at 17 and began corresponding with him in earnest while writing \\u201cHamilton,\\u201d said he was initially afraid of intruding on Sondheim\\u2019s time.\", \"\\u201cIt took me a while to realize he was serious when he said, \\u2018Reach out if you ever want to talk about anything,\\u2019\\u201d Miranda said.\", \"The letters Sondheim wrote over the decades were so numerous that they might seem cheap currency if they weren\\u2019t so powerfully affecting to the recipients. Imagine the hand of God reaching toward Adam in Michelangelo\\u2019s fresco and you have some idea of the vital charge they could carry.\", \"After Sondheim died, Twitter was flooded with images of them. Notes to students and professionals and fans, they were thoughtful and specific, full of gratitude and good wishes, each on letterhead, each with the elegant, sloping signature that\\u2019s familiar now from the Stephen Sondheim Theater marquee.\", \"\\u201cHe was always concerned about the future of the art form, and he wanted it to survive,\\u201d said the director Lonny Price, who played one of the leads in the original Broadway production of Sondheim\\u2019s \\u201cMerrily We Roll Along.\\u201d More than three decades later, he directed the documentary \\u201cBest Worst Thing That Ever Could Have Happened,\\u201d about the making of that show, a notorious flop.\", \"But it was as a Sondheim-obsessed 14-year-old in 1973 that he struck up a decades-long correspondence with his hero, and discovered that Sondheim was kind enough to take him seriously.\", \"\\u201cHe didn\\u2019t have biological children,\\u201d Price said. \\u201cBut there are so many of us that are his kids.\\u201d\", \"Noah Brody and Ben Steinfeld of Fiasco Theater got a cherished letter from Sondheim in 2013, after he saw their company\\u2019s production of \\u201cInto the Woods.\\u201d Declaring it \\u201cinventive and exhilarating,\\u201d he ended with a breathtaking line: \\u201cYou make me want to write more.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt was the most important thing that\\u2019s ever happened in our professional lives,\\u201d Steinfeld said, calling it \\u201cunspeakably meaningful\\u201d to learn \\u201cthat the cycle of inspiration might have actually flowed in the other direction.\\u201d\", \"After that, Sondheim opened his archives to the company as he collaborated with them on their 2019 Off Broadway revival of a reworked \\u201cMerrily We Roll Along.\\u201d\", \"SONDHEIM CULTIVATED the field by founding the Young Playwrights Festival, where the theater and television writer Zakiyyah Alexander recalls him having \\u201ca proud dad vibe\\u201d about her and the other teenage winners. Elsewhere he championed emerging composer-lyricists like Larson and Miranda and Dave Malloy. For years, he was the president of the Dramatists Guild Council.\", \"Revered as the closest thing we had to a theatrical deity, Sondheim didn\\u2019t retreat to reign alone on some Olympus. He ambled down from the mountaintop fully aware of the power and responsibility that came with his position\", \"And so it was immensely moving, but utterly unsurprising, that he spent his last day of theatergoing, two days before he died, taking in a pair of form-bending documentary plays that were struggling at the Broadway box office and about to close: a matinee of \\u201cIs This a Room\\u201d and an evening performance of \\u201cDana H.,\\u201d both at the Lyceum Theater.\", \"He had told a New York Times journalist his plan, and after he died, Michael Paulson reported what he had said in anticipation: \\u201cI can smell both of those and how much I\\u2019m going to love them.\\u201d\", \"To Emily Davis, the star of \\u201cIs This a Room,\\u201d the fact of Sondheim having been there \\u2014 which she said she learned about only when she read it in the newspaper \\u2014 felt like \\u201cthe biggest and most grand actual welcome to Broadway that there could have been.\\u201d\", \"And when she noticed, the day after his death, an unusually large number of audience members doing doubleheaders \\u2014 spending their Saturday catching both plays \\u2014 it seemed to her like people paying tribute to him by doing as he had done.\", \"Children will listen. He got that right.\", \"The composer Jeanine Tesori, who spent many hours alongside Sondheim as the supervising vocal producer on the new \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d movie, got her first letter from him in the 1980s, when she was just out of college. To her retrospective mortification, she had mailed him some music she\\u2019d written.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s what we all did,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe just cold sent him our stuff because we didn\\u2019t know not to do that: send a cassette, and then you would just sort of wait and hope.\\u201d\", \"He wrote back, gently, apologizing that he had been unable to listen to her tape \\u2014 and somehow even that felt like a kind of validation, because he had noticed she was there.\", \"\\u201cThe beautiful thing was, it didn\\u2019t go into the ether,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe could have easily ignored it. But what he did was acknowledge that he had gotten it, and he returned it. I\\u2019ll never forget those words, typewritten: \\u2018Forgive me.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"TO A LEGION OF FANS Sondheim was and is the be-all and end-all. But his own horizons as a theatergoer were significantly broader than that. In an art form that is so much about being present for the unrepeatable moment, he not only showed up, but he also often did so to experience work that was offbeat and obscure, challenging conventions just as his own work did.\", \"When the Chicago-based experimental shadow-puppetry troupe Manual Cinema brought \\u201cAda/Ava\\u201d to New York in 2015, Sondheim headed downtown to see what they were up to \\u2014 \\u201cthe ultimate pinch-me moment,\\u201d said Ben Kauffman, one of the company\\u2019s composers.\", \"When Mindy Kaling and Brenda Withers performed their loopy Matt Damon-Ben Affleck sendup \\u201cMatt & Ben\\u201d at P.S. 122 in 2003, Sondheim went backstage afterward to celebrate its unknown, 20-something playwright-stars.\", \"Kaling tweeted last weekend that she\\u2019d told him she hoped someday to star in one of his shows; Withers, by phone, recalled his grace in focusing the encounter on them, not him.\", \"\\u201cHe made the effort to stay and talk to us and see our eyes get wide and let us ask him a couple questions,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe wasn\\u2019t there because his publicist told him to be there, and to be nice. He was there because he wanted to be.\\u201d\", \"But Sondheim, far too famous simply to blend into an audience, was cautious about making such appearances. Jason Eagan, the artistic director of the artist incubator Ars Nova, said that Sondheim went to shows there but never to openings, because he didn\\u2019t want to be a distraction on someone else\\u2019s big night.\", \"And while there was nowhere for him to hide when he first saw the immersive \\u201cNatasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812\\u201d at Ars Nova\\u2019s tiny space in Hell\\u2019s Kitchen, when he went to see it on Broadway, he sat in the mezzanine to be as inconspicuous as possible.\", \"However much that theatergoing nourished him, as it nourishes all of us when the work is good, it was also frequently an obligation, and he fulfilled it diligently. Tesori remembers him showing up at City Center just after his close friend, the author and composer Mary Rodgers, died in 2014.\", \"He had promised that he would listen to some young artists perform his music, so he did \\u2014 \\u201ceven though he was heartbroken,\\u201d Tesori said. He asked her to give him the performers\\u2019 addresses, \\u201cbecause he wanted to write to all of them, to encourage them.\\u201d\", \"Even in freshest grief, that was his habit.\", \"The playwright Lynn Nottage, now a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, was returning to the theater after a seven-year absence when Sondheim wrote to her out of the blue in 2004, praising her new play \\u201cIntimate Apparel\\u201d and telling her: \\u201cIt reminded me of why I wanted to write for the theater in the first place.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI entered back into New York theater sort of tiptoeing and frightened and not sure whether there was a space for me,\\u201d Nottage said. \\u201cAnd so when I received this letter from one of the giants, it just was the kind of affirmation that I needed in the moment. What it said to me more than anything is that I belong in this community.\\u201d\", \"From then on, at all of her plays, she said, \\u201cat some point I\\u2019d look out in the audience, and there he would be.\\u201d\", \"SONDHEIM\\u2019S LETTERS generally weren\\u2019t long, but it\\u2019s the little things, right? Except that the little things combine to eat up who knows how many hours of a life. And even when a genius lives to 91, it\\u2019s easy to lament \\u2014 as Miranda recently did, in an interview in The New Yorker \\u2014 the works that went uncreated because of finite energies expended elsewhere.\", \"Over the phone a few days after Sondheim\\u2019s death, though, Miranda said he didn\\u2019t truly feel that way.\", \"\\u201cObviously it\\u2019s to theater\\u2019s enormous benefit that he took that time, and I think it fed him to encourage others,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHe succeeded on both fronts because he left a legacy of immortal works that we\\u2019ll be doing forever \\u2014 I mean, just look at this season alone \\u2014 and he also left behind a generation of artists who got encouragement from him, and support.\\u201d\", \"It was part of Sondheim\\u2019s gift to understand not only the encompassing job description of great artist but also his singular effect on his colleagues \\u2014 how even a few words of appreciation, or moments of attention, could prove enduring sustenance over the long slog of a career in an often pitiless field.\", \"It was unglamorous work, and Sondheim did it exquisitely.\", \"No single theater artist right now is as revered as he was. No one else can yet step into those shoes. We nonetheless could, artists and audience members alike, seek to borrow from his example \\u2014 by being adventurous, by being generous, by showing up.\", \"That would be one way to honor the giant.\"]","href_hash":"7939454b529111ec81de372dbf136874"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7939454b529111ec81de372dbf136874"}},
