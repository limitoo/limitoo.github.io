They come with sound, of course \\u2014 they\\u2019re inseparable from the music that feeds them. And they possess those heightened but elusive qualities that only firsthand memory confers.\", \"Alexis Smith, in red spangles, winking at the audience as she launches into an irresistibly rhymed confession of a divided self in \\u201cFollies\\u201d (from 1971, and my first Broadway show). Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou rising through the stage floor as waxwork corpses, singing one of the most chilling reprises in Broadway musical history, in \\u201cSweeney Todd\\u201d (1979). Mandy Patinkin finding anguished, atomic energy in a painter\\u2019s obsessive quest to render a hat on canvas in \\u201cSunday in the Park With George\\u201d (1984).\", \"Strangely, the visuals that come closest to evoking such moments are not the photos or videos of performances but, instead, black lines \\u2014 and whorls and swirls and loops \\u2014 on white paper. They are the work of the great theater caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, whose drawings of all things theatrical in the Sunday New York Times have entranced me since I was a child in North Carolina. Even then, these pictures seemed to breathe and move in a way the photographs in the same pages never could. Somehow, they even smelled like Broadway to me.\", \"Recently, I\\u2019ve been looking through his drawings of works by Sondheim, who seems particularly to have engaged and inspired Hirschfeld. They span the decades, from \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d and \\u201cGypsy\\u201d (for which Sondheim wrote the lyrics) in the 1950s to \\u201cPassion,\\u201d Sondheim\\u2019s last new show on Broadway, from 1994. In these drawings, I have found something like a past-recapturing, Proustian madeleine, made of ink instead of flour and sugar.\", \"These seemingly simple pen strokes \\u2014 and the ellipsis of the white space, which your own, happily collaborative mind fills in \\u2014 are anything but static. They tremble with energy, tension and, above all, character, as it is conjured in real time on a stage.\", \"Hirschfeld always said he would rather be called a \\u201ccharacterist\\u201d than a caricaturist. His illustrations of Sondheim, the most complex character portraitist in the Broadway songbook, make you understand why. Caricatures are a shorthand for the physical traits that make stars distinctive: Angela Lansbury\\u2019s immense Tweety Bird eyes, for example, or Bernadette Peters\\u2019s Cupid\\u2019s bow mouth.\", \"Hirschfeld nails such elements of physiognomy. He also endows them with the exciting emotional temperature that heats up every Sondheim song. The Lansbury he draws as the corrupt mayor Cora Hoover Hooper of \\u201cAnyone Can Whistle\\u201d (1964) and as the cannibal pie-maker Mrs. Lovett in \\u201cSweeney Todd\\u201d are recognizably the same woman.\", \"But you can also feel how Lansbury physically and psychically inhabits these roles in the slope and size of her shoulders, in the focus in those saucer eyes \\u2014 manically mesmerized as Cora, fretful and eager as Mrs. Lovett. After staring at the \\u201cWhistle\\u201d illustration, in which Cora\\u2019s outsize ambition dwarfs the frame, I could swear that I saw that production, though I couldn\\u2019t possibly have.\", \"Consider Hirschfeld\\u2019s Joanna Gleason, restless and leery as the Baker\\u2019s Wife in \\u201cInto the Woods.\\u201d Or Patinkin and Peters \\u2014 he all penetrating angles, and she, self-contained curves \\u2014 as the incompatibly in-love artist and model of \\u201cSunday.\\u201d Or Donna Murphy, as implacable and demanding as some Assyrian god, as the sickly, love-consumed Fosca in \\u201cPassion.\\u201d\", \"The diversity and scope of tone and substance embodied in drawings, in all their gleeful concentration of energy, make you understand why a Sondheim character remains a holy grail for singing actors.\", \"For the record, those figures include the inhabitants of two Sondheim shows now happily in revival in New York: \\u201cAssassins\\u201d (a dark show that left me sleepless after I first saw it Off Broadway in 1991), currently at the Classic Stage Company, and \\u201cCompany,\\u201d Sondheim\\u2019s breakthrough work from 1970 about being single in a world of Manhattan marrieds.\", \"The latest version, which opens Thursday night, has been reconceived in a gender-reversed version by the director Marianne Elliott. I caught its first incarnation in London and look forward to seeing it again. In the meantime, I find an odd and comforting appropriateness to this period of mourning Sondheim in Hirschfeld\\u2019s sketch of the original show.\", \"Hirschfeld portrays the show\\u2019s leading man, the ambivalent bachelor Bobby (Dean Jones), surrounded by and submerged in the tantalizing phantoms of the women in his life. You get the impression that Bobby will never be free of their presences. Typically, Bobby appears to regard this life sentence with both regret and pleasure. Me, I feel only pleasure \\u2014 and so much gratitude \\u2014 at the prospect of being haunted for the rest of my life by the ghosts of Sondheim performances past.\"]","href_hash":"bb79a5b158d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bb79a5b158d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}},
