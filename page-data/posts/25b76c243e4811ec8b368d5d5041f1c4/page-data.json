He was part of the French leader\\u2019s inner circle, accompanying him on official visits, biking trips, tennis matches and other outings.\", \"But in July 2018, Mr. Benalla was identified by the newspaper Le Monde in a video that showed him wearing a police helmet as he grabbed, dragged and hit a man during an unruly labor protest in Paris, on May 1 that year.\", \"The report, and the presidency\\u2019s fumbling response, caused a firestorm of criticism that fed months of media coverage and parliamentary inquiries, seriously testing Mr. Macron for the first time since his election. It was quickly revealed that the presidency had known about the beating for months but had disciplined Mr. Benalla with little more than a slap on the wrist.\", \"Coming on the heels of other controversies involving Mr. Macron \\u2014 including influence-peddling accusations against a close aide, a dust-up over an expensive new dinner service, and his public scolding of a student \\u2014 the case gave his political opponents ammunition to portray the French president as out of touch and his administration as opaque.\", \"At the trial, held in September, Mr. Benalla acknowledged a lapse in judgment but denied assault.\", \"Mr. Benalla had joined security forces as an observer on the day of the demonstration and he argued that he had been trying to help officers apprehend protesters who had thrown objects at the police. But the court ruled that he had illegally and violently interfered with police work and assaulted four protesters in total.\", \"Mr. Benalla, who now works as a private consultant, was also found guilty of illegally using diplomatic passports that he had kept after he was fired from the president\\u2019s office, of faking documents to obtain another kind of official pass, and of unlawful possession of a firearm in 2017.\", \"Vincent Crase, 48, a friend of Mr. Benalla and a former reservist gendarme who used to work for Mr. Macron\\u2019s party \\u2014 and who faced charges similar to Mr. Benalla\\u2019s for his actions in May 2018 \\u2014 was also convicted, as were two police officers who had sent Mr. Benalla video footage of the incident pulled from street surveillance cameras.\"]","href_hash":"25b76c243e4811ec8b368d5d5041f1c4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"25b76c243e4811ec8b368d5d5041f1c4"}},
