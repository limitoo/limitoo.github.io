Before technology existed to stay underwater long enough to watch undersea creatures in their natural habitat, illustrations of sea life might show the creatures sprawled out around a tableau of the seaside. A linguist feels like someone who gets to hang around underwater watching those creatures party, while everybody else settles for seeing a few specimens that wash up on the shore.\", \"For example, because English doesn\\u2019t have the long lists of endings that some languages have, it can seem as if our language\\u2019s grammar is kind of dull. But there\\u2019s so much that we just aren\\u2019t trained to see. In Cantonese, for example, there are lots of particles that you place at the end of a sentence to convey countless degrees of sentiment. \\u201cNei hai gam jat faan uk kei?\\u201d means just \\u201cYou\\u2019re returning home today?\\u201d But \\u201cNei hai gam jat faan uk kei gaa?\\u201d can lend a note of displeasure, as in \\u201cYou\\u2019re returning home today? Seriously?\\u201d\", \"English doesn\\u2019t have as much as Cantonese by way of particles like this. But think about what the \\u201cbe\\u201d in \\u201cDon\\u2019t be telling me you can\\u2019t make it\\u201d means \\u2014 that same skeptical note. Similar is \\u201cgo and\\u201d if we say, for example, \\u201cNow he\\u2019s going to go and shut it all down.\\u201d It conveys disapproval of what\\u2019s about to happen, even though by itself \\u201cgo and\\u201d means no such thing (nor does \\u201cbe\\u201d). In terms of marking the passive, the way we\\u2019re taught is with forms of \\u201cbe\\u201d: \\u201cHe was included.\\u201d But what about the one with \\u201cget\\u201d? \\u201cHe got hurt,\\u201d \\u201cHe got laid off,\\u201d \\u201cHe got hit.\\u201d English has a neutral passive \\u2014 and a special passive that you use for something negative or unexpected. Note how saying, \\u201cIn the battle he was hurt\\u201d sounds more clinical and less real than saying that \\u201che got hurt,\\u201d because \\u201cbe\\u201d elides that getting hurt was something bad that came as a surprise.\", \"I also hear English as having all kinds of coded ways to throw shade, of a kind that learners could be taught just as carefully as they are taught something as straightforward as putting an \\u201cs\\u201d on a verb in the third person singular. These aren\\u2019t idioms in the sense of \\u201ccall it a day\\u201d or \\u201con the ball\\u201d; they\\u2019re grammar. Black English has even more such constructions, using the otherwise neutral verb \\u201ccome\\u201d: \\u201cHe come saying nobody knew until today\\u201d implies that you\\u2019re not happy with him. Black English even has a future perfect of disapproval: \\u201cI\\u2019ll be done left if she tries getting here late again.\\u201d (I owe this observation about this construction to the linguist and poet Alysia Harris.)\", \"There are many other things that hit a linguist\\u2019s ear that way: As one of \\u201cA Hundred Million Miracles\\u201d that Oscar Hammerstein wrote about in a song for the musical \\u201cFlower Drum Song,\\u201d one was a baby learning to walk who \\u201cnearly doesn\\u2019t fall.\\u201d Or \\u201cown\\u201d: It\\u2019s a verb, but also an adjective, as in \\u201cmy own book.\\u201d But why not \\u201cmy owned book\\u201d? And as an adjective, it\\u2019s odd: What\\u2019s own about the book? And while you can say \\u201cthe red book\\u201d and \\u201cThe book is red,\\u201d why not \\u201cThe book is own\\u201d? It goes on: I have \\u201cmy very own car\\u201d \\u2014 but I can\\u2019t say \\u201cI have a really own car.\\u201d We say, \\u201cHe came into his own\\u201d \\u2014 but his own what? I\\u2019ve heard Britons say \\u201cShe got her own back\\u201d to mean she got back at someone. But again, her own what?\", \"Few of us ever have reason to think what a quirky thing our humble \\u201cown\\u201d is. But imagine being new to the language and having to master just how we use this crazy little thing: I once knew such a guy who would say \\u201cI just rented a own apartment,\\u201d and I felt genuinely pleased that I picked up his meaning before I had to think about it!\", \"Then there are the things that strike people as mistakes, where a linguist just sees the language moving along. Most of what distinguishes the language of \\u201cBeowulf\\u201d or \\u201cThe Canterbury Tales\\u201d from the English we know is what started as \\u201cmistakes.\\u201d One example these days, which people often write me about, is \\u201cversus\\u201d becoming a verb. Kids, especially, hear it as \\u201cverses\\u201d and for years now have been saying things like \\u201cWe versed them in baseball last year.\\u201d\", \"A preposition becoming a verb \\u2014 \\u201cWhat\\u2019s next?\\u201d you might ask. And I would say, more of that, and all power to it. After all, the word \\u201cnewt\\u201d is a mistake that happened when people said \\u201can eft\\u201d so often that they began to think it was \\u201ca neft,\\u201d and later \\u201cneft\\u201d became \\u201cnewt.\\u201d Today, \\u201ceft\\u201d is found mostly in crossword puzzles, and I wouldn\\u2019t want to give up \\u201cnewt.\\u201d The singular \\u201ccherry\\u201d is \\u201cwrong\\u201d \\u2014 it started as the French \\u201ccerise\\u201d and people misheard the \\u201cs\\u201d sound as a plural and made up the singular word \\u201ccherry.\\u201d Who would have it otherwise now?\", \"It\\u2019s getting close to the centenary of \\u201ctalkies,\\u201d and old movies can teach us much about how new words happen. \\u201cCute\\u201d began as a slangy way of saying \\u201cacute,\\u201d and then drifted off into having a new meaning. In the 1938 comedy \\u201cTopper Takes a Trip,\\u201d a woman being wooed says a man\\u2019s come-ons are \\u201ccute talk\\u201d \\u2014 but she means that he\\u2019s a bit shifty, not that he\\u2019s irresistible. Even now, the word still has a whiff of meaning \\u201cacute,\\u201d as when you refer to someone pulling one of those \\u201ccute\\u201d moves where you mean clever, not adorable.\", \"Thus, someone in my line of work hears around him a linguistic feast, where many just hear the English language going to the dogs.\", \"There are few better ways to get a sense of the true wonder of English than curling up with \\u201cThe Cambridge Grammar of the English Language\\u201d by Rodney Huddleston and my friend Geoffrey Pullum. After reading my essay on subject pronouns, Geoffrey usefully reminded me that if we want the rule about conjunctions to really apply to the whole language, then what we\\u2019re talking about are \\u201ccoordinating\\u201d conjunctions, where \\u201cand\\u201d is used to link, or coordinate, two nouns or pronouns. But you and me have, of course, already been over this one.\", \"Stella Tan and Vivian S.
