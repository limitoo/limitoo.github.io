If it wasn\\u2019t an immediate love connection, there was certainly a strong like.\", \"Ms. R\\u00f6hm, 48, had been talking about Yaddo, the artist\\u2019s retreat in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.\", \"Mr. Glatzer, 57, a film producer and hotel developer, went to neighboring Skidmore College and had visited the retreat several times.\", \"\\u201cI couldn\\u2019t get in, even with Sam Waterston being on the board,\\u201d said Ms. R\\u00f6hm, an actress known for her performance in the TV series \\u201cLaw & Order,\\u201d and in movies like \\u201cAmerican Hustle\\u201d and \\u201cBombshell.\\u201d She is also the director of the recently released Lifetime movie, \\u201cSwitched at Birth.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Glatzer was beguiled by both Ms. R\\u00f6hm and her interest in the East Coast art community. \\u201cI just was like, Who is this gorgeous woman talking about Yaddo?\\u201d he said. \\u201cI was stunned by her.\\u201d\", \"They were both dating other people at the time, though, and even though Ms. Brenner told Mr. Glatzer that Ms. R\\u00f6hm\\u2019s relationship wasn\\u2019t serious, Mr. Glatzer decided to pursue a friendship instead.\", \"\\u201cI was like, no, no, no, no, no, I\\u2019m just going to get to know her and be her friend,\\u201d he said.\", \"For four and a half years, Mr. Glatzer and Ms. R\\u00f6hm saw each other socially, and shared occasional lunches and dinners alone. But there was no romance.\", \"\\u201cThere wasn\\u2019t really a feeling from either of our side that the other one held a flame for the other one,\\u201d said Ms. R\\u00f6hm, who graduated from Sarah Lawrence with a bachelor\\u2019s degree in writing and European history.\", \"Then the pandemic hit, and the two friends found themselves part of the same social bubble. At the end of a dinner party last December at Ms. Brenner\\u2019s home, Mr. Glatzer\\u2019s lips found Ms. R\\u00f6hm\\u2019s.\", \"Despite either\\u2019s claims to have had no idea that the other harbored any amorous feelings, they discovered that they had misjudged the situation. \\u201cWhen we kissed that night, it was the kiss to end all kisses,\\u201d she said.\", \"[Click here to binge read this week\\u2019s featured couples.]\", \"That they had been friends for so long before, Ms. R\\u00f6hm said, made it obvious that their romantic relationship was not a fly by night affair.\", \"\\u201cThere was a seriousness to it,\\u201d she said, adding they entered the relationship \\u201cwith a sense of responsibility. There are many other fish in the sea. You don\\u2019t need to date one of your friends unless your intentions are really true.\\u201d\", \"Ms. R\\u00f6hm was engaged twice and has a 13-year-old daughter, Easton, with her former partner. But neither she nor Mr. Glatzer had ever been married. (He had never even been engaged.)\", \"\\u201cWe weren\\u2019t in a race to get married, we both felt marriage was sacred and that there was no reason to do it unless we felt that we wanted to be with somebody forever,\\u201d Ms. R\\u00f6hm said. \\u201cIt was a very big life decision for both of us, especially at this age.\\u201d\", \"The couple took a big step toward a future together in May, when Ms. R\\u00f6hm moved in with Mr. Glatzer at his Beachwood Canyon home. The couple had \\u201cabsolutely\\u201d decided to marry, \\u201cBut we wanted to live together first,\\u201d said Ms. R\\u00f6hm.\", \"They were wed Oct. 5 in the backyard of their home, before Ms. R\\u00f6hm\\u2019s daughter and Mr. Glatzer\\u2019s brother, Jonathan Glatzer, and his family. Their friend Doug Budin, a Universal Life minister, officiated.\", \"After the 30-minute ceremony, they sipped Champagne and then ate roasted chicken and grilled vegetables. \\u201cIt was almost like a Thanksgiving dinner,\\u201d she said.\", \"The couple are planning a larger celebration in January with about 150 guests. Their intimate wedding, though, made sense for many reasons.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re coming off a Covid world and we\\u2019ve lived for the last almost two years a more simple life, a life where we\\u2019re cooking at home and nurturing each other and recognizing our values,\\u201d the bride said. \\u201cI think that had a lot to do with Peter and I recognizing each other.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"51bff6fd43a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"51bff6fd43a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}},
