Trump and his allies tried to use to overturn the 2020 election, arguing that the ambiguity of the statute puts democracy itself at risk.\", \"The push to rewrite the Electoral Count Act of 1887 \\u2014 enacted more than a century ago in the wake of another bitterly disputed presidential election \\u2014 has taken on new urgency in recent weeks as more details have emerged about the extent of Mr. Trump\\u2019s plot to exploit its provisions to cling to power.\", \"Mr. Trump and his allies, using a warped interpretation of the law, sought to persuade Vice President Mike Pence to throw out legitimate results when Congress met in a joint session on Jan. 6 to conduct its official count of electoral votes\", \"It was Mr. Pence\\u2019s refusal to do so that led a mob of Mr. Trump\\u2019s supporters to chant \\u201cHang Mike Pence,\\u201d as they stormed the Capitol, delaying the proceedings as lawmakers fled for their lives. Members of Congress and the vice president ultimately returned and completed the count, rejecting challenges made by loyalists to Mr. Trump and formalizing President Biden\\u2019s victory.\", \"But had Mr. Pence done as Mr. Trump wanted \\u2014 or had enough members of Congress voted to sustain the challenges lodged by Mr. Trump\\u2019s supporters \\u2014 the outcome could have been different.\", \"\\u201cWe know that we came precariously close to a constitutional crisis, because of the confusion in many people\\u2019s minds that was obviously planted by the former president as to what the Congress\\u2019s role actually was,\\u201d said Zach Wamp, a former Republican congressman from Tennessee who is a co-chairman of the Reformers Caucus at Issue One, a bipartisan group that is pressing for changes to the election process.\", \"Republicans in Congress have repeatedly blocked efforts by Democrats to alter election laws in the wake of the 2020 crisis, and it is not clear whether a bid to revamp the Electoral Count Act will fare any better. But experts have described the law as \\u201calmost unintelligible,\\u201d and an overhaul has the support of several leading conservative groups.\", \"\\u201cThere are a few of us on the committee who are working to identify proposed reforms that could earn support across the spectrum of liberal to conservative constitutional scholars,\\u201d said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and a member of the Jan. 6 committee. \\u201cWe could very well have a problem in a future election that comes down to an interpretation of a very poorly written, ambiguous and confusing statute.\\u201d\", \"Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming and the vice chairwoman of the committee, said on Thursday that \\u201cthe 1887 Electoral Count Act is directly at issue\\u201d and that the panel would recommend changes to it.\", \"The Constitution leaves it up to Congress to finalize the results of presidential elections shortly before Inauguration Day. Article II, Section 1 says, \\u201cThe president of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted.\\u201d\", \"But the process is further detailed in the Electoral Count Act, which says that as lawmakers read through the electoral results of each state during a joint session of Congress, members of the House and Senate may submit objections in writing, which can be sustained if a majority of both chambers approves. In the event that a state submitted multiple slates to Congress, the governor\\u2019s certified electors would hold, the law says, unless a majority in both chambers voted to reject them.\", \"The statute was written in the aftermath of the disputed election of 1876 between Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel J. Tilden, and has dictated how Congress formalizes elections, mostly without incident, ever since.\", \"But what unfolded on Jan. 6 tested its limits.\", \"Both of the objections by Mr. Trump\\u2019s allies \\u2014 who sought to invalidate the electoral votes of Pennsylvania and Arizona \\u2014 failed in the House, although the vast majority of Republicans supported them. Yet in the months since, it has become clear those challenges were part of a broader strategy. John Eastman, a lawyer advising Mr. Trump, drafted a plan that included sending to Mr. Pence, who presided over the joint session in his role as president of the Senate, a slate of Trump electors from seven states won by Mr. Biden.\", \"Mr. Eastman and other allies of Mr. Trump suggested pressuring the vice president to accept the alternate slate of Trump electors, throwing out legitimate votes for Mr. Biden. Under such a scenario, Mr. Eastman argued, a vote of those states\\u2019 delegations in the House, favoring Republicans, could keep Mr. Trump in power.\", \"\\u201cThe antiquated law governing the Electoral College vote count is too vague and ripe for abuse, and it resulted in baseless objections that delayed the democratic process,\\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota and the chairwoman of the Senate Rules Committee. \\u201cIt\\u2019s time to update this law to safeguard our democracy.\\u201d\", \"Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, has indicated an openness to revising the statute, and a small group of senators, including Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, has been working on potential solutions.\", \"A bipartisan coalition of state and local lawmakers is also on board, as are some organizations that study election issues, including Issue One and the National Task Force on Election Crises.\", \"In documents circulated on Capitol Hill, the task force \\u2014 which calls the Electoral Count Act \\u201cseverely flawed\\u201d \\u2014 proposes several broad changes. The suggestions include limiting the grounds for a lawmaker to object to counting a state\\u2019s votes and clarifying that the vice president\\u2019s role in the process is merely ministerial, and thus lacking the authority to unilaterally throw out a state\\u2019s votes. It has also recommended setting clearer time limits for states to choose electors.\", \"The effort could be the focus of Congress\\u2019s next attempt to change election law, after Republicans blocked legislation to establish nationwide standards for ballot access in response to voting restrictions being enacted at the state level, and a narrower measure to restore parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act weakened by Supreme Court rulings.\", \"Unlike those bills, there is significant support among Republicans outside of Congress for overhauling the Electoral Count Act, though no Republican in Congress has publicly endorsed a rewrite. Prominent conservative writers such as Dan McLaughlin of The National Review, Walter Olson at the Cato Institute, Kevin R. Kosar of the American Enterprise Institute and Ramesh Ponnuru of Bloomberg have argued for changing the law.\", \"Trey Grayson, a former Republican secretary of state of Kentucky, said in an interview that he was concerned that, without changes to the law, there would be future attempts to exploit it by both parties.\", \"\\u201cI worry that this is going to become routine, because the incentive structure is there,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s really easy for somebody to play to the base, object, know they\\u2019re going to lose, but reap the rewards of appealing to the base. Those actions hurt our democracy.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"359b1bbc54ec11ecace8b7bad40206c8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"359b1bbc54ec11ecace8b7bad40206c8"}},
