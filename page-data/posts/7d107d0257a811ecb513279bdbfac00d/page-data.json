We have lost residents. We lost businesses,\\\" said Joetta Stevenson, president of local community group the Greater Fifth Ward Super Neighborhood. She also described how previous highways projects have \\\"sliced and diced\\\" Fifth Ward, a majority Black neighborhood.\", \"The proposal would renovate about 24 miles along Interstate 45 and other roads around Houston, which supporters like the state's Transportation Commission say would be safer, cause less traffic, and improve the area's ability to deal with floods and other disasters that could require evacuations.\", \"The project is under a spotlight as it could indicate how seriously President Joe Biden's administration is taking into consideration the impact infrastructure plans have on different minority groups.\", \"Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said the department plans to listen to concerns like the ones on display in Houston to change the historical trend of transportation projects harming minority groups and poorer areas of the country.\", \"The Federal Highway Administration has yet to announce when the review of the Houston project will be finished.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946415/houston-infrastructure-racial-bias.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Traffic flows south on Interstate 45 and the frontage road in the afternoon on Nov. 19, 2021, in Houston.
