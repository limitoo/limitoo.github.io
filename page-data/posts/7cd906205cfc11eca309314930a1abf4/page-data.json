It is the pulsars' motion around each other and their incredibly powerful gravitational fields that provide a near-perfect gravity laboratory.\", \"General relativity suggests that the mass of an object warps the very fabric of spacetime, and the greater the mass, the more extreme the curvature. A common analogy physicists use to describe this is that of placing a marble and a bowling ball on a trampoline.\", \"The bowling ball clear causes the larger dent, and when the marble rolls past it the path it takes is curved to follow this dent. Light does the same when it passes a massive cosmic object like a black hole or these pulsars.\", \"University of British Columbia at Vancouver professor, Ingrid Stairs, explained what observing light emitted from the pulsar showed her and her fellow researchers. She said: \\\"We see for the first time how the light is not only delayed due to a strong curvature of spacetime around the companion but also that the light is deflected by a small angle of 0.04 degrees that we can detect.\\\"\", \"In addition to this, the team of scientists were able to test a series of other predictions made by general relativity, including the effect of time dilation\\u2014the stretching of time caused by tremendous gravitational fields\\u2014and the change in the orientation of the orbit previously seen around Mercury, but 140,000 times stronger around these pulsars.\", \"\\\"Never before has such an experiment been conducted at such a high spacetime curvature,\\\" Stairs added.\", \"Physicists continue to search for physical characteristics of the Universe not described by general relativity because, despite how successful the theory has been in describing gravity and the physics of truly massive bodies in space, it can't be united with quantum physics, the best description physicist have of the sub-atomic.\", \"This means that gravity, one of the Universe's four fundamental forces, stands apart from the other three\\u2014electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces\\u2014all of which are united in quantum physics.\", \"\\\"It is therefore important to continue to place the most stringent tests upon general relativity as possible, to discover how and when the theory breaks down,\\\" Ferdman continued.\", \"\\\"Finding any deviation from general relativity would constitute a major discovery that would open a window on new physics beyond our current theoretical understanding of the Universe.\\\"\", \"Ferdman points out, this could eventually lead to a \\\"unified theory\\\" of physics, that offers a complete description of the forces of the Universe, and something that physicists like Stephen Hawking have spent a lifetime searching for.\", \"Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy researcher Michael Kramer said: \\\"Our work has shown the way such experiments need to be conducted and which subtle effects now need to be taken into account.\", \"\\\"And, maybe, we will find a deviation from general relativity one day.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1951292/pulsars.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">An illustration of two pulsars, extreme stars orbiting around each other.
