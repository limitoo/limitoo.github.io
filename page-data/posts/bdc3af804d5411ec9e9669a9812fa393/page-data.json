With 12 weeks of paid time off, he could be there to help his wife through postpartum difficulties and have time to bond with their new baby, \\u201cwithout having to get permission, make compromises or take vacation time,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cIt\\u2019s impossible to put into words how much it meant to me as a dad.\\u201d\", \"Jessica Grose, who writes our parenting newsletter, recently asked men to start shouting about the need for paid family leave. With the just-passed House version of President Biden\\u2019s Build Back Better plan, which includes four weeks of paid family leave, about to be debated by the Senate, we thought the time was right to reach out to fathers and other non-birthing parents to ask about their experiences.\", \"Hundreds of readers, including Whitney, shared how having paid time off \\u2014 or not \\u2014 affected their ability to be a caregiver, to help a partner recover from childbirth, to bond with an adopted child, to maintain financial stability or to establish a feeling of equity in the household, among other things. In some cases, even when leave was available, taking time off was frowned upon by employers. Grose shares some of these stories in her newsletter today and writes about the stigma surrounding paternal leave in particular.\", \"You can read more stories about parental leave below. They have been edited for clarity and length.\", \"For my family to have child care covered for the first seven months of my son\\u2019s life, between my wife\\u2019s leave and mine, has been an incredible experience. Being in the thick of watching him grow has been so rewarding, but so has learning how to keep a home afloat with a newborn. I took him to various classes and events around the city, and 95 percent of the time it was \\u201cme and the moms\\u201d or \\u201cme and the nannies,\\u201d as I would tell my wife. I would have loved to meet other fathers.\", \"I work in marketing for a pharmaceutical company, and my employer\\u2019s 12-week paid leave policy is relatively new. I tacked on two weeks of caregiver leave and added a few days of vacation for a total of about 15.5 weeks. Initially, I faced questions as to whether I could truly be out that long, but once the policy was clarified, people were very supportive. Most of my co-workers have older children, and they were actually envious of the time I received. Their advice was simply to enjoy it. People don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re missing when they don\\u2019t have this time. \\u2014 Michael Harris, 36, New York, N.Y.\", \"My employer, a tech company, offered eight weeks of paid parental leave to me, a benefit I was thankful to have when so many get little or no leave. I took it all. The time was exciting, stressful, exhausting, exhilarating, and my wife and I got to experience every minute of it together. I wouldn\\u2019t change that experience for the world.\", \"The thing that stood out to me the most was that I had time to really get to know my daughter in a way that usually only moms get to experience. I learned which blanket she liked best when she was in her swing; the secret way to hold her to get her to burp faster; which animal noises always made her smile. Once I went back to work, it was easier for me to keep up with my daughter\\u2019s developments because we\\u2019d developed that deep bond from the start.\", \"I don\\u2019t see this as an economic issue \\u2014 it\\u2019s a human rights issue. \\u2014 Arjun Sharma, 32, Smyrna, Ga.\", \"I hadn\\u2019t really thought of family leave until I had a child of my own. I really didn\\u2019t understand the need for it. When my wife and I adopted our child in 2006, I worked for a small marketing firm with no official paternal leave. I was a member of the senior leadership team, so I could have negotiated some sort of unpaid leave, but we really couldn\\u2019t afford it, having both been in graduate school in the years immediately before the adoption. We had no real savings.The compromise was that I was allowed to work from home one day a week for a year so that I could be near my new daughter more often. My wife was able to work part time and extend her internship, which she needed to complete her doctorate in psychology. I can\\u2019t imagine needing time off for my body to heal. \\u2014 Charles L. Greene II, 52, South Hadley, Mass.\", \"I did not ask for leave. Our daughters were born in 1978 and 1980, and it simply was not done. It would have been the same as asking for time off to play golf every day for three months.\", \"I was somewhat relieved that I wouldn\\u2019t have to be at home all day, every day, helping take care of this little creature. That was my wife\\u2019s job, and I thought it would be like the show \\u201cLeave It to Beaver,\\u201d where I went off to work and came home to dinner and my new family. In fact, I was coming home to a woman completely burned out and half-terrified that she was doing everything wrong. This led to anger and disharmony between us; I couldn\\u2019t (wouldn\\u2019t?) understand what the problem was. Dinner often ended up being eaten by myself, as the baby was already in bed and my wife was locked in the bedroom crying.\", \"Our daughters now have children, the youngest of which is about to turn 1. They and their husbands have the incredible good fortune of working for employers who provide extensive parental leave as a benefit and have enjoyed extended paid time off. They have something my wife and I did not have when they were born and, to be honest, something the larger corporate culture told me I did not deserve. \\u2014 Jim Castrone, 70, Placitas, N.M.\", \"I took a total of 12 weeks of paid parental leave for both of my children, the same amount that my partner took. As a father who places a high value on being able to nurture my children emotionally, I consider those periods to be necessary time to develop those skills.\", \"It\\u2019s also important to us that the domestic work of parenting be shared, and I needed my early parental leave to form habits of care that were equally divided from the start. I don\\u2019t think it would have been possible for us to share the work of feeding, changing, consoling, bathing and clothing them if she had taken months of leave and I had taken just weeks. \\u2014 Jacob Snow, 42, San Francisco\", \"I am the non-birthing parent to a 1-year-old (my spouse carried). My company\\u2019s policy offers 12 weeks of paid leave for primary caregivers and two weeks of leave for secondary caregivers, but it doesn\\u2019t define those terms. I explained that my partner was the one giving birth but I still requested the 12 weeks. \\u201cThere is no primary caregiver in my house,\\u201d I told them. They granted it.\", \"Since then, I\\u2019ve convinced a few of my male colleagues to do the same. This kind of leave is vital for all parents. The time off for recovery from birth should be a no-brainer, but how are you supposed to recover while keeping a brand-new human alive without any help? \\u2014 Erin Learoyd, 40, Massachusetts\", \"I wasn\\u2019t granted any parental leave (I work at a small nonprofit, so those types of benefits weren\\u2019t an option) but I made a concentrated effort to store paid time off during the pregnancy and was allowed to use two weeks when the baby arrived. I can\\u2019t imagine having gone back to work any earlier. Breastfeeding was an extremely stressful and frustrating process. Without my continuous emotional support, my wife said it was unlikely she would have continued with it. Our baby also struggled with acid reflux. If she was awake, she was crying, and she was always awake. It was absolutely critical that we had each other to pass her off to when our nerves broke.People don\\u2019t like to talk about just how frustrated and full of rage you can get at your own baby, but it is enormous and it\\u2019s frightening, and everyone needs someone to share that burden with. It\\u2019s an imperative that would lead to dramatic improvements in our culture and our way of life. \\u2014 Sean Gilligan, 29, Anoka, Minn.\", \"I am the sole provider for our family and was able to take one week of vacation for the birth of both my sons. My wife endured an emergency C-section to bring our first son into the world in 2015. Although young and healthy, her delivery and recovery was traumatic, including a trip to the emergency room several days later when her incision popped open. She had a raging infection. Caring for the wound was so complicated that they implored us to hire a nurse to come pack it four times a day for a month so she could recover. Although we are a middle-class family, we couldn\\u2019t afford a nurse and I took on the responsibility of caring for my wife, who could not physically walk to the bathroom solo for several weeks. We were barely home from the hospital when the office started calling. We were both completely frazzled, burned out and depressed with juggling the stress of work on top of this huge change.\", \"We\\u2019ve since had another son and are currently expecting a third baby. All of these births have required me to bully my way into having a week off to tend to my wife and hold my sons. Both parents need family leave. I am convinced that we would return to work happier, healthier and more productive. \\u2014 Adam Denton, 36, Louisville, Ky.\", \"My wife and I were both allowed to use five days of sick leave when we adopted our child in 2011. Any other paid leave had to be vacation. We saved vacation days and money scrupulously for years \\u2014 we were always thrifty \\u2014 but this was a big lift on top of adoption-related expenses. Still, my wife was only able to stay home for a month and I was home for four months, most of that unpaid.\", \"I would have loved to have had at least 12 weeks paid off so we didn\\u2019t have to spend so much of that time worried about money and staying covered by insurance. We spent every last cent we had in those months. I am still mad about it. It has always felt like adoptive parents are given the short end of the stick because no one in our family gave birth, but early bonding time is critical. \\u2014 Paul Hillstrom, 40, Minneapolis\", \"My wife and I are partners in a small business. Her last entry in her Day Runner the morning of the day she gave birth was Friday\\u2019s payroll, so I would only have to write and sign the checks. Ten days later was her next entry, after a C-section and a little less than a week in the hospital (that was fairly standard back in 1984). Because paid leave wasn\\u2019t on anybody\\u2019s radar then, it made an incredibly challenging phase in our lives that much more difficult. And it had a direct impact on our decision not to have a second child.\", \"Years later I was asked to testify before a committee of New Jersey\\u2019s legislature in support of paid family leave; I did so enthusiastically. Paid leave is a moral imperative, an economic necessity and an investment in the business sector. Under Build Back Better the extra income for small-business owners would have allowed us to hire temporary help. Four weeks leave won\\u2019t last long \\u2014 it will be replaced by 12 weeks leave when enough American families and businesses experience the benefits first hand. \\u2014 James K. Conklin, 69, Glen Ridge, N.J.\", \"The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We\\u2019d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.
