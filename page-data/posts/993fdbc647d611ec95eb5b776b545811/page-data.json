Those who have answered Ben\\u2019s online call for a role-playing game include Maggie (Lindsley Howard), a young woman who lives with her protective father; the aloof 20-or-30-somethings Doug (Quinn Franzen) and Rachel (Caitlin Morris); and Shawn (Will Dagger), who joined after his revelatory AMFE (After My First Episode) moment.\", \"One night, Maggie makes a misstep. Dressed in full-on Pony attire, something the group\\u2019s members usually avoid to dodge harassment, she is picked up by members of a neighborhood watch on her way to Ben\\u2019s apartment. That same night Jean (Anna Ishida, appropriately baffled) shows up at Ben\\u2019s place, but soon realizes she has mistaken the group for another \\u2014 9/11 truthers like herself \\u2014 and is promptly shown out. These incidents set the Rust Belt Bronies on a paranoid spiral, which is made worse when they discover that the neighborhood watch is actually a group called the Antelope Party, whose mission is to rid the country of homeless people, street kids and other \\u201cwild dogs.\\u201d\", \"The shift is a bit of bait-and-switch: Instead of examining the intricacies of \\u201cMy Little Pony\\u201d fandom, \\u201cThe Antelope Party\\u201d has more in common with sociopolitical films like \\u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers,\\u201d in which suspicions about the mysterious \\u201coutsider\\u201d stoke fears among a particular group of people. Meyer explores these dynamics, and how people gain power in social groups: Is it granted, won by force or is it more unpredictable?\", \"The ensemble members are convincing in their portrayal of vulnerability. Dagger\\u2019s wimpy Shawn is a believable beta male whose desperation for social standing leads him to dark places, and Howard\\u2019s Maggie is perfect as the peppy type whose \\u201cdaddy\\u2019s girl\\u201d veil hides a sinister reality. The charismatic Mawere is intensely watchable as Ben, a host who is eager to please.\", \"In her direction of the cast, Jess Chayes leans into the characters\\u2019 cautiousness in social settings by smartly avoiding to stage action when none is called for, though the play never feels sluggish. And Yu-Hsuan Chen\\u2019s clever one-room set \\u2014 the walls fold in and out to create spaces outside of the group\\u2019s meeting spot \\u2014 emphasizes their precarious hold on this made-up world.\", \"As in her work on WP Theater\\u2019s \\u201cOur Dear Dead Drug Lord,\\u201d another pessimistic tale of a group\\u2019s descent into chaos, Chen shows an innate understanding of the intimacy of small spaces, and of how the clutter strewn about amounts to an intensely personal ecosystem. Here, Ben\\u2019s fuzzy neon pillows and \\u201cMy Little Pony\\u201d throw blankets are paraphernalia that can be quickly hidden, should a judgmental outsider arrive.\", \"By taking various precautions \\u2014 part childish desire to protect their cool little club, part survival response to actual danger \\u2014 the group believes itself impervious to outside forces. But \\u201cThe Antelope Party\\u201d crafts a clever little awakening for them, and anyone who shares their belief that there is safety in numbers.\"]","href_hash":"993fdbc647d611ec95eb5b776b545811"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"993fdbc647d611ec95eb5b776b545811"}},
