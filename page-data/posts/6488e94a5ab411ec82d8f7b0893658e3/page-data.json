Since they got their hands on an Omicron sample at the end of last month, the team hasn't left the lab.\", \"And while there is still plenty of work left to do, he says one thing has become clear this week: \\\"This thing is the most evasive one we've seen so far.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What are we dealing with?</div>\", \"The first stage of Turville and his team's investigations involved pitting the variant against 14 donor samples which had received two doses of either Pfizer or AstraZeneca and a product called hyperimmune globulin, made up of thousands of blood donors, which is used as an \\\"early warning device of how a variant may evade antibodies\\\".\", \"\\\"[Hyperimmune globulin] has this really beautiful breadth, so it has the ability to bind to lots of different SARS-CoV-2 variants,\\\"\\u00a0Turville says.\\u00a0\\\"If you've got a variant that escapes that or reduces the efficacy or potency of that product, then you're moving into kind of new territory.\\\"\", \"By Wednesday this week, the team had a \\\"snapshot\\\" of what we are dealing with. The two-dose vaccine antibodies used in the test couldn't block Omicron.\", \"The hyperimmune globulin was able to inhibit Omicron, but at a concentration 11 to 13 fold greater than what is needed to get the same result against the earlier Wuhan strain.\", \"\\\"Essentially what we learnt from that experiment was that 'oh, this thing is evasive',\\\" he says. \\\"It's not surprising that a lot of people who are vaccinated are getting it.\\\"\", \"The next stage, which began this week and will likely take about a fortnight, is testing the variant against hundreds of antibody samples, ranging from people who have been vaccinated, to people that have recovered from Delta, and people who have been fully vaccinated and recovered from COVID-19.\", \"\\\"We just line up donor after donor after donor,\\\" Turville says. \\\"We'll be upwards, hopefully, of hundreds next week.\\\"\", \"That will hopefully result in a clearer picture of what donor antibodies are able to block Omicron, and what's unique about them, compared to those that can't.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5ab05f4d0be1537481d161dcda831b61\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Does the arrival of Omicron make boosters more urgent?</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">From the lab to the real world</div>\", \"To people studying the Omicron outbreak in South Africa, where it was first detected in a swab taken on November 8, the Kirby Institute's early results would likely not have come as a surprise.\", \"This week COVID-19 cases in Africa were up by 93 per cent, according to the World Health Organization, with the greatest increase in the southern part of the continent. Research is underway to determine if Omicron, which has now been detected in almost 60 countries, is fuelling the wave.\", \"Meanwhile, many of the new cases in South Africa are reinfections in people who have previously had COVID-19.\", \"This data suggests Omicron is likely at least as spreadable as the earlier Delta variant, according to\\u00a0Professor Tony Cunningham, the co-director of the Centre for Virus Research at the Westmead Institute, which is in the midst of its own research into the variant. It also supports the Kirby Institute's findings that Omicron is able to more easily evade pre-existing antibodies.\", \"Researchers will now be looking to determine Omicron's so-called \\\"R factor\\\" or \\\"effective reproduction number\\\" \\u2014 a shorthand for exactly how transmissible the variant is. This will allow researchers to tell how it compares to previous COVID-19 variants and other viruses.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3773c557d6b8c425c68a9fdfd53b2adb\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Turville and his team are testing how Omicron reacts when pitted against different antibodies.\\u00a0(Supplied: Stuart Turville)</div>\", \"For\\u00a0Turville, however, the important question is what happens once the variant gets into a host. \\\"There's one question, 'do you get infected?', the second question is, 'how badly do you get infected?',\\\" he says.\", \"\\\"The whole thing about vaccines is that if they keep you out of hospital, they've worked, if they keep you alive, they've worked.\", \"\\\"You may not have the antibodies to stop it early, but once the virus gets in at least you've got what we call immunological memory \\u2026 because it has that head start, it can give your body the ability to launch [a defence] not only harder, but faster.\\\"\", \"All experts who spoke to ABC News for this story say that vaccines, and especially booster shots, are an important step in preventing severe disease from Omicron.

Professor Sarah Palmer, a virologist with the Westmead Institute, told ABC News last week it's possible Omicron was created when strains of Delta and Alpha recombined.\", \"If this is the case, it's the first time \\\"recombination\\\" has been detected in SARS-CoV-2.\", \"A further mystery is how the second Queensland Omicron strain, or sister strain, which has 14 gene changes compared to the South African Omicron's 30, came to be.\", \"The pair are closely related, but it's too early to tell whether their genetic differences will mean different epidemiological affects. \\\"Perhaps, wherever Omicron originated some of those cases went somewhere else and continued to evolve, maybe down its own little path,\\\" Mackay says.\", \"It's possible the second Omicron was even a precursor to the main Omicron.\", \"\\\"The way to see [viruses] is they're like really error-prone bloggers, they make lots of spelling mistakes,\\\" Turville says. \\\"And in the process of doing that they generate swarms of different flavours \\u2014 the majority of the errors amount to nothing, but there are occasions where a change makes a difference.\\\"\", \"Scientific theory states that viruses mutate most effectively by infecting someone who has weak levels of immunity.\\u00a0Turville describes such a host as a \\\"training ground\\\" for the virus, where it is comfortable enough to figure out how to evade antibodies.\", \"\\\"In the average person, we've got a pretty robust immune response so it doesn't have much time to train, it doesn't have much time to accumulate those changes in the training battle ground,\\\" he says.\", \"But in someone who is immunocompromised, he says, the virus can persist for upwards of 140 days. \\\"It's getting trained, a little bit of an antibody, but not a lot, a little bit of immunity, but not quite enough, and it goes\\u00a0'oh I've got enough time to change'.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">The path forward from here</div>\", \"While new variants are far from unexpected, this one has come at an inopportune time for Australia.\", \"Not only is the holiday season \\u2014 and all the social events that come with that \\u2014 upon us, in eastern Australia, La Ni\\u00f1a has forced people back indoors where viruses spread more easily.\", \"In New South Wales, where more than 40 Omicron cases have been detected, it has also arrived just in time for the easing of restrictions for unvaccinated residents next week.\", \"This combination of ingredients has some experts concerned we could soon see an influx of cases. \\\"The stars are aligning in that we'll be opening more borders and sharing more virus,\\\" Mackay says.\", \"Cunningham says it's impossible to predict whether we will soon see a sizeable Omicron wave in Australia, but says it's wise for people to be cautious. Many of his colleagues say they'll be donning masks again while in indoor public places.\", \"And while 93 per cent of Australia's over-16 population has had at least one vaccine dose, many of whom are approaching\\u00a0eligibility for a booster shot, there's one group with almost non-existent immunity: children 11 years old and under. It was only announced this week that the vaccine rollout for children between five and 11 would begin from January 10.\", \"It's this group that is of interest to Professor Fiona Russell, a paediatrician and epidemiologist from the University of Melbourne. In South Africa, she says, there was an initial increase in hospital admissions of children under-5 with COVID-19 \\u2014 but many of them only tested positive after visiting the hospital for an unrelated reason.\", \"Like previous strains, she says Omicron symptoms in children have been mostly mild. But with a more evasive variant, the question is then whether kids will pass it on to vulnerable adults. \\\"It's really a watch and see, and watch very, very carefully,\\\" Turville says.\", \"Asked about what next year will bring, Turville compares the emergence of Omicron to what was happening at the end of 2020, when the world saw the arrival of the Alpha, Beta and Gamma strains.\", \"\\\"[In 2020] we had a step in the evolutionary process of the virus, suddenly we had a very different one \\u2026 and we noticed very early that it was taking a bit of the edge off the vaccine response. But then Delta kind of took over in 2021,\\\" he says.\", \"\\\"If we fast forward and we see Omicron or an equivalent turn up and replace Delta \\u2026 we'll probably need a rearguard, the first line will be boosters and, hopefully, the cavalry will be variant specific boosters.\", \"\\\"That will be the thing to look forward to in 2022.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"6488e94a5ab411ec82d8f7b0893658e3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6488e94a5ab411ec82d8f7b0893658e3"}},
