Below him: seven bottles of limited-edition mezcals, each with tasting notes embossed on thick, black card stock. He poured a thimble\\u2019s worth of $150-per-bottle tobala into five silver jicaras, tiny bowls that are traditional vessels for sipping mezcal.\", \"\\u201cTake a sip, leave it in your mouth for 10 to 12 seconds, let your taste buds get exposed,\\u201d he said. The second sip was to be consumed in silence \\u2014 save for the moody guitar piped in through surround-sound speakers \\u2014 to \\u201cget lost in the flavors.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cNow move on to your next bite,\\u201d he said, gesturing at a row of monochrome, glitter-dusted gummies, the confections that might have resulted if Willy Wonka had ventured into triple-digit tasting menus. He explained that some of the treats were made from mol\\u00e9, offered a tangent about the history of mole (\\u201cIt\\u2019s a beautiful story\\u201d) and grabbed another bottle by the neck: \\u201cBefore I forget \\u2014 you have to try black magic.\\u201d\", \"A deep purple liquid poured out, prompting gasps. \\u201cAll natural,\\u201d Mr. Zapata said, \\u201call plant-based.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhat gives it its color?\\u201d the woman next to me asked.\", \"\\u201cTrade secret,\\u201d said Vicente Cisneros, El Silencio\\u2019s co-founder. He sat across from Mr. Zapata in dark sunglasses and a company-branded hat. \\u201cEverything we do gets copied in two seconds,\\u201d Mr. Cisneros added, shrugging, \\u201cbut that\\u2019s why we\\u2019re innovating all the time.\\u201d\", \"A legend says that several hundred years ago, in pre-Columbian Mexico, a lightning bolt struck an agave plant and released the juice we now call mezcal. But to the credit of health-conscious consumers, valuation-seeking start-up founders, George Clooney or all of the above: Mezcal\\u2019s international moment is now.\", \"According to Mexico\\u2019s mezcal regulatory commission, more than $413 million worth of mezcal was produced last year, up from $350 million in 2019. Americans are consuming more of it than ever: Drizly, the app for alcohol on demand, saw a 600 percent year-over-year increase in mezcal sales in the United States. Large alcohol conglomerates are clamoring to back brands \\u2014 El Silencio is partially funded by Constellation Brands, whose portfolio includes Corona and Robert Mondavi. Direct-to-consumer start-ups are multiplying like so many spiky agaves under the sun \\u2014 including one backed by LeBron James, called Lobos 1707.\", \"Smoky and earthy, mezcal has become a mainstay on the menus of trendy restaurants and cocktail bars. But for many people, the drink\\u2019s appeal is its authenticity \\u2014 which means that some of its longtime proponents have mixed feelings about its sudden popularity and interest from businesspeople far from Mexico.\", \"\\u201cI never expected this sort of Columbus crusade,\\u201d said Bricia Lopez, a Oaxaca native whose Los Angeles restaurant, Guelaguetza, stocks more than 100 mezcals.\", \"Ms. Lopez cringes at hobbyists or investors who talk about \\u201cdiscovering\\u201d the spirit. She said she liked the way El Silencio, owned by two Mexican citizens, was growing: sustainably and in a way that aimed to create wealth for the region.\", \"\\u201cYou cannot buy tradition, and that\\u2019s what people who are getting into the mezcal business today are trying to do,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re trying to position themselves next to someone who looks like an Indigenous person, take a picture and be like, \\u2018I\\u2019m authentic, too.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Ms. Lopez added, \\u201cThey start these brands, and they think they\\u2019re coming up with a story that\\u2019s unique to them, but it\\u2019s the same freaking story: \\u2018I\\u2019m a white guy who went to Oaxaca and, like, I fell in love with the people.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"You can see why they would try, given the case of Mr. Clooney. In 2017, Casamigos, the tequila brand he co-founded, was acquired by the beverage company Diageo for an estimated $1 billion. That sale \\u201cprompted this whole rush of people to get into the industry,\\u201d said Susan Cross, the co-founder of the website Mezcalistas. \\u201cLike, \\u2018Look, there\\u2019s so much money to be made.\\u2019 But it\\u2019s difficult to build a mezcal brand.\\u201d\", \"The most common species of agave takes seven years to mature. Mezcal is traditionally produced in small batches, the smoked agave mashed to a pulp by a donkey and distilled in copper stills. According to one report, tequila had global revenues of $9.4 billion in 2020. Mezcal\\u2019s revenues: about 4 percent of that. While tequila is technically a type of mezcal, Jalisco, the state that produces the majority of the world\\u2019s tequila, has infrastructure that Oaxaca can\\u2019t yet match.\", \"\\u201cThe biggest brand of mezcal is not even at 100,000 cases,\\u201d said Harry Kohlmann, the chief executive of Park Street Companies, which helps fledgling spirits brands expand. \\u201cBut you have to think about 10 years from now,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere are going to be several brands who are over 100,000 cases. One will be over one million cases.\\u201d\", \"What if mezcal is a sleeping giant, the next natural wine, the next hard seltzer? (Once, there was Zima. Now, there\\u2019s a $4.5 billion market.)\", \"Ray Lombard, the executive vice president of Southern Glazer\\u2019s Wine & Spirits, the largest wine and spirits distributor in the United States, sees this moment as a tipping point. \\u201cThe only mezcal you used to be able to buy was the one with the worm in the bottle,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNow we\\u2019re seeing triple-digit growth. The race is on.\\u201d\", \"One of the early entrants into the mezcal rush was John Rexer, a New Yorker who created his brand, Ilegal, in 2006. He had developed a taste for mezcal in the 1990s while importing furniture from Mexico. (He had also been bootlegging unmarked mezcal across borders, hence the name.)\", \"Ten years later, enough converts and tastemakers in the U.S. and elsewhere had acquired an affinity for Ilegal that it became a sought-after investment, and in 2016, Bacardi acquired a minority stake in Mr. Rexer\\u2019s brand. In 2017, the French company Pernod Ricard bought a majority stake in Del Maguey (known for its green bottles and painterly labels), and in 2019, Constellation Brands acquired a minority stake in El Silencio.\", \"\\u201cI think we can be a several-hundred-thousand-case brand,\\u201d Mr. Rexer said. \\u201cI hate to throw demographics out of there, but mezcal is something that Gen Z and millennials have fallen in love with.\\u201d\", \"Its prevalence at much-hyped cocktail bars has a lot to do with that.\", \"\\u201cLet\\u2019s say you\\u2019re from Kansas and you go to Miami for a weekend,\\u201d Mr. Kohlmann, who is based in Miami, said. \\u201cYou go to a bar, you have a cool bartender mixing your drink and through social media, you try to amplify your experience. You want likes, you want to take a picture of yourself with a drink. That drink can\\u2019t be rum and coke. It has to be something special. That\\u2019s how a lot of fancy brands are being built.\\u201d\", \"Also aiding mezcal\\u2019s rise: the notion that agave-based spirits are \\u201cclean,\\u201d i.e., devoid of additives that can trigger a hangover and also act as stimulants, unlike other alcohols.\", \"\\u201cNo,\\u201d said Serena Poon, a certified nutritionist and Reiki practitioner whose clients include Jerry Bruckheimer and Kerry Washington. \\u201cAll alcohols are depressants.\\u201d (She repeated this two more times.) \\u201cStraight agave spirits may be \\u2018cleaner\\u2019 because your body isn\\u2019t processing as many ingredients as it would with a hard seltzer or sugary cocktail. It\\u2019s no different than if you were to have whole foods as opposed to something that\\u2019s packaged.\\u201d\", \"The same could be said about any additive-free spirit \\u2014 vodka, say. What makes mezcal especially appealing to certain consumers are the variations in flavor and provenance, whereas premium vodkas pride themselves on tasting like nothing at all. For instance: Clase Azul\\u2019s Guerrero mezcal, from the Mexican state of the same name, tastes markedly more woody and sharp than its mezcal from Durango.\", \"\\u201cOne day, people will be going to Oaxaca the way they go to Napa,\\u201d Ms. Lopez, the Los Angeles restaurant owner, said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s already starting to happen.\\u201d\", \"Specifically, it is happening at Casa Silencio, El Silencio\\u2019s luxury getaway in an agave field. A first-of-its-kind enterprise, the resort might have seemed unrealistic a few years ago; now, it feels prescient.\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t just sell mezcal,\\u201d Mr. Zapata said, \\u201cwe sell Oaxaca in a bottle.\\u201d\", \"There is nothing in sight around the compound save for agave spikes; Mr. Zapata and Mr. Cisneros, Silencio\\u2019s chief marketing officer, funded the construction of a mile-long road to the outskirts of the nearest town, Xaaga, to make their hotel accessible to guests. They came up with the concept after visiting the Glenmorangie and Macallan distilleries in Scotland.\", \"Mexico City natives and childhood friends, the founders reconnected in Santa Monica, Calif. a decade ago when their children were in the same kindergarten class. In 2013, Mr. Zapata, then a real estate developer between projects, met the founder of Chase Foundation, which provides quality-of-life services to terminally ill children.\", \"Mr. Zapata offered to create a fund-raising event, which quickly became a scheme to turn a Beverly Hills hotel bar into a mezcaleria for a night. \", \"Mr. Zapata asked Mr. Cisneros, a designer, to help with the event. They made four trips to Oaxaca and \\u201cfell in love with everything about the process,\\u201d Mr. Zapata said. Except one part: transporting unlicensed, unregulated cases of mezcal to the United States.\", \"They cajoled their friends who lived in San Diego to drive to a warehouse in Tijuana; one was detained and forced to pour out his stash. The event sold out. The morning after, Mr. Zapata and Mr. Cisneros woke up to screenfuls of texts, all with some version of the same message: \\u201cHow do I get your mezcal?\\u201d Mr. Zapata said, \\u201cI called Vicente and said, \\u2018Dude, I think we have a company.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The investment from Constellation Brands \\u2014 an amount both parties declined to disclose \\u2014 helped El Silencio increase distribution and build the resort, which also functions as a distillery and office for some of the company\\u2019s 79 employees. Visitors can hack at agaves, hurl them into a smoking pit and nod as guides promote the distillery\\u2019s one-ton, solar-powered, stone-grinding wheel as a more humane and sustainable method of mashing the roasted agave than the traditional donkey stomping.\", \"\\u201cThose animals defecate while they\\u2019re working,\\u201d Mr. Zapata said. \\u201cWe double-distill, but still.\\u201d\", \"A subterranean lounge houses mezcals infused with cannabis (not for sale). By the guest rooms sit an onyx infinity pool and lounge chairs draped with fur throws. An amphitheater features a schedule of guests: D.J.s, chefs and, eventually, shamans, who will conduct \\u201critual healing ceremonies,\\u201d per the company\\u2019s publicist. Too much?\", \"Not to their investors, Jennifer Evans, a vice president of Constellation Brands, said.\", \"\\u201cTheir unique approach,\\u201d she added, \\u201creally resonates with new-age consumers.\\u201d\", \"This smoldering industry has enticed newcomers, like the year-old Rosaluna, a brand with a dusty-rose label and icons seemingly inspired by Indigenous art (or at least a quick image search). It\\u2019s the brainchild of \\u201cbest friends who traveled together, drank together and partied together,\\u201d said co-founder Nate Brown.\", \"Mr. Brown, a former creative director for Kanye West, and his co-founder, Terry Lee, previously the chief operating officer of MeUndies, did not know how make mezcal when they started Rosaluna. But they were consumers. \\u201cWe were always really conscious of what we were putting in our bodies. We were agave drinkers,\\u201d Mr. Brown said.\", \"On a Utah ski trip a few years ago, a few mezcals deep, they talked about creating a mezcal brand. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not from Mexico, we didn\\u2019t know who we\\u2019d talk to, but then I was like, \\u2018Wait a minute, I met this guy named Pepe at a Miami Heat game. What if I WhatsApp-ed him right now?\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Brown recalled. \\u201cI sent him this kind of drunk, novel-length text.\\u201d\", \"Pepe Mireles Ver\\u00e1stegui became the third co-founder of Rosaluna, which is now the house mezcal of the Soho House club in the United States. \", \"The Rosaluna founders have given equity to J.J. M\\u00e9ndez Le\\u00f3n Jim\\u00e9nez and Frida M\\u00e9ndez Le\\u00f3n Jim\\u00e9nez, the Oaxacan brother and sister who oversee the production of their mezcal. David Mayer de Rothschild, the banking family\\u2019s youngest heir and the founder of the year-old lifestyle brand Lost Explorer, did the same with his Oaxaca-based producers, Don Fortino Ramos and his family. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a gold rush,\\u201d he said, adding that he was aware of the backlash from those who want the spirit to remain local and artisanal.\", \"He sees his brand as about something bigger than returns. \\u201cWe are all lost explorers,\\u201d he said. (His Zoom name is David de Explorer.) \\u201cWhen you\\u2019re younger, everything is awe and wonder. You get older and that sense of magic disappears. I want to go back to that place. I think our product does that. It suddenly allows you that feeling of warmth.\\u201d\", \"He added, \\u201cWe endeavor to be a brand that transcends commercial transaction. Maybe it sounds a bit pretentious and worthy, but whatever.\\u201d\", \"Critics have bemoaned imperialism in the mezcal industry: the coastal elites flying in, scraping up their juice and selling it for 10 times as much back home. \\u201cMaybe they just want to grab some juice, put in a nice bottle and they\\u2019re great marketers,\\u201d Ms. Lopez said. \\u201cAwesome. Good for them. People like that could go to the jungle and sell plants. It\\u2019s just a skill.\\u201d\", \"When Ms. Lopez buys for her restaurant, she pays attention to who is selling it: \\u201cNow, any mezcal that I carry has to be woman-owned, Mexican-owned or has to have the producer in some sort of ownership structure.\\u201d\", \"In the case of El Silencio, increased demand for mezcal allowed the company to hire Luis Hernandez, a chemist at the University of Oaxaca, who is working to develop a standardized training program for budding mezcaleros, or distillers \\u2014 a craft that has traditionally been passed down through generations. El Silencio has hired several of Mr. Hernandez\\u2019s students.\", \"Finding economic opportunity without destroying what made mezcal popular in the first place remains an ever-present tension.\", \"\\u201cI think the reason why people are going for mezcal is because tequila has become boring,\\u201d Ms. Lopez said. But the new kid on the block \\u2014 or behind the bar \\u2014 can only stay novel for so long. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the same thing that happened when people stopped drinking vodka and started drinking tequila. \\u201d\"]","href_hash":"449786a83ee111ec9ef7eb76041703c1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"449786a83ee111ec9ef7eb76041703c1"}},
