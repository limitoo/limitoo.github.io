Here is all you need to know about whether these concerns are justified.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-07T02:29:47.000Z","content":"[\"Kamala Harris reportedly insists on using wired headphones, as she perceives Bluetooth connectivity as a security risk.\", \"According to a recent article from Politico's \\\"West Wing Playbook\\\", the Vice President is especially cautious when it comes to the use of several forms of technology. The piece cites former aides, who allege that Harris favors texting over email, and that she is also reluctant to let others wait alone in her office prior to meetings.\", \"Yet the claim that Politico really focuses on (and the one that has gained the most attention online), is that the Vice President is \\\"Bluetooth-phobic\\\". The article contends that Harris will only use wired headphones, as she believes that Bluetooth devices are vulnerable to attacks from malicious hackers.\", \"To substantiate these claims, the piece goes on to reference multiple instances of the political figure visibly using wired headphones. Examples of this include the famous video of her calling Joe Biden to congratulate him on winning the 2020 election, and her appearance on The View back in September 2021.\", \"One of the article's contributors, Alex Thompson, has even compiled a gallery of screenshots depicting Harris using wired headphones in various interviews and out in public.\", \"At the end of the piece, Politico mentions that they have reached out to the Vice President's office to see if there is a reason why Harris is so \\\"paranoid\\\" when it comes to Bluetooth. At the time of publication, the website says they received no response.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Is Bluetooth Really a Security Risk?</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946521/kamala-harris-washington-dc.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Image shows Vice President Kamala Harris speaking about Covid-19 vaccine equity in Washington, D.C. on November 22, 2021. </div>\", \"The Politico article largely frames Harris's purported aversion to Bluetooth as a quirky eccentricity, without really exploring if it's justified or not.\", \"This has resulted in heavy criticism on social media, with lots of users (including tech reporters and cyber-security specialists) pointing out that there are legitimate concerns about the vulnerabilities of Bluetooth.\", \"For example, New York Time's columnist Zeynep Tufekci tweeted that: \\\"Bluetooth is a well-known security risk\\u2014including the possibility of escalating and executing code\\u2014well, malware\\u2014on the phone.\\\"\", \"Likewise, Bryon Tau, who covers matters of surveillance and privacy for The Wall Street Journal, writes: \\\"Bluetooth peripherals are a security risk. If they don't rotate their unique identifier, they can easily be sniffed and tracked. If there are flaws in the security, they can be compromised. Most people don't have to worry about these things, but high-level federal officials should.\\\"\", \"Finally, Nu Wexler, who has worked at tech companies as well as in Washington, indicates that the entire tech side of his Twitter feed is reporting on \\\"known security vulnerabilities in Bluetooth technology and [that] a high-level target like the VP shouldn't use AirPods.\\\"\", \"It is true that, for most people, Bluetooth security needn't be a massive concern, but it does make sense for somebody in Harris' position to be extra vigilant. In fact, a cyber security sheet from the National Security Agency (NSA) warns that malicious actors can indeed compromise wireless technologies like Bluetooth and Near Field Communications (NFCs).\", \"The document adds that: \\\"the risk is not merely theoretical [as] these malicious techniques are publicly known and in use [...] Malicious actors can scan for active Bluetooth signals, potentially giving them access to information about the targeted device. They can then leverage that information to compromise the device.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Bluejacking, Bluesnarfing and Bluebugging Explained </div>\", \"The NSA document specifically highlights the dangers of \\\"Bluejacking\\\", \\\"Bluesnarfing\\\", and \\\"Bluebugging\\\".\", \"If you are not familiar with these threats, they all relate to exploiting a wireless connection to somebody else's device without their knowledge, although the end results are different in each case.\", \"Bluejacking is when somebody uses wireless connectivity to send you unsolicited messages. Unless you click on any links or give away personal information, this can be relatively harmless and is often used just to annoy people.\", \"Bluesnarfing on the other hand is much more serious, as it entails the actual theft of information (including images, calendars, messages, videos, documents and contact lists) over Bluetooth.\", \"Worst of all, Bluebugging allows a hacker to access your device and take full control of it. Once they have done so, they are able to eavesdrop on your conversations, make phone calls, send messages and raid your files.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How To Be Safe With Bluetooth</div>\", \"If all the above has scared you off ever using Bluetooth or wireless devices again, rest assured that it's probably fine for most people. It just makes sense for a Vice President to take special precautions.\", \"Speaking of which, there are a few things you can do to increase your own cyber security when using Bluetooth. IT provider CPI Solutions recommends that you turn off \\\"discoverable mode\\\" whenever you are not using it, that you minimize unnecessary use of Bluetooth in public settings wherever possible, that you do not accept pairing requests from unknown contacts, and that you activate Two Factor Authentication (TFA) for any important apps or programs.\", \"Elsewhere, it is generally smart to look out for any unusual activity with your phone. If you notice that it is sporadically connecting and disconnecting from the internet, turning off without warning, or that there is call history that you do not recognize, this may indicate that somebody has been Bluebugging you.\", \"Again, to mitigate this, it is recommended that you turn off discoverable mode and only accept pairings from trusted users. Finally, it also behoves you to make sure that your Bluetooth devices are fully updated to their newest versions, so that they are running with the latest security software.\"]","href_hash":"88ff556c574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"88ff556c574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}},
