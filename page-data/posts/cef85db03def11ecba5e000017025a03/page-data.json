It is now home to a Covid outbreak linked directly to those protests that threatens to burden intensive care units, with an unvaccinated minority endangering public health.\", \"Italy\\u2019s measures, which went into effect Oct. 15, require proof of vaccination, a negative test or recent Covid recovery to go to work. Though protests have died down elsewhere in the country, Trieste has developed a reputation as a center of vaccine skepticism, prompting a ban on demonstrations. The region\\u2019s president put it bluntly: \\u201cIt is the moment to say with clarity: Enough idiocy.\\u201d\", \"Last week, new cases in the city of 200,000 doubled from the week before, to more than 800. Covid patients have taken up about 18 percent of the region\\u2019s intensive care beds. Trieste\\u2019s top law enforcement official said that the current outbreak was \\u201cstrictly correlated\\u201d to the protests.\", \"Divides: In Germany, an increase in cases and hospitalizations has led the health minister, Jens Spahn, to warn of \\u201ca pandemic mainly among the unvaccinated, and it is massive.\\u201d\", \"Pandemic resurgence: Europe is experiencing near-record levels of coronavirus infections, with 1.8 million new cases and about 24,000 deaths in the past week. \\u201cEurope is back at the epicenter of the pandemic \\u2014 where we were one year ago,\\u201d said Dr. Hans Kluge, the W.H.O.\\u2019s director for Europe.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"The authorities in Ethiopia have accelerated their campaign against ethnic Tigrayans, who are accused of sympathizing with the rebels now pressing toward Addis Ababa, the capital. Security officers went from house to house, conducting searches and arbitrary arrests and leaving families cowering in their homes, dreading a knock on the door.\", \"The sweeping measures targeting Tigrayans raised concerns that the stage has been set for bursts of ethnically motivated violence. Tigrayans said they were being targeted on the basis of their identity cards or their language. Fighters from the same ethnic group have been locked in civil war with Ethiopian government forces for the past year.\", \"Ethiopia\\u2019s embattled prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, announced a state of emergency on Wednesday that granted him draconian powers. An Ethiopian government post on Facebook made stark reference to Tigrayan leaders and their supporters, stating, \\u201cA rat that strays far from its hole is nearer to its death.\\u201d\", \"International efforts: The U.S. envoy to the Horn of Africa, Jeffrey Feltman, flew into Addis Ababa as the leader of an international scramble to stop the violence and bring Ethiopia\\u2019s warring parties to the table. There were few signs it might succeed.\", \"In nationwide municipal elections, South Africans rebuked the African National Congress, handing it less than half the overall vote for the first time. Voters went to the polls to choose councilors and mayors, but they used the opportunity to vent about national issues, including record unemployment and the government\\u2019s handling of Covid.\", \"Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, is admired among South Africans, but they see a disconnect between his message of renewal and the corruption that has sullied his party among local leaders. Not since Nelson Mandela was the face of the party has the A.N.C. so heavily relied on the personality of its leader in a local election, one organizer said.\", \"Quotable: They listen to him, they like him,\\u201d said Mcebisi Ndletyana, a political scientist at the University of Johannesburg, of the president. \\u201cBut when they lower their eyes to the local leaders that are there, they see mediocrity.\\u201d\", \"George Seitz\\u2019s disappearance in 1976 drew little notice \\u2014 until investigators found his skeleton in a backyard in New York more than 40 years later. This is how the police cracked a grisly cold case.\", \"The actor is earning some of the best reviews of his career for his turn as a vicious bully named Phil in the forthcoming movie \\u201cThe Power of the Dog.\\u201d To become that seething cowboy required a focus on the character\\u2019s physicality, Roslyn Sulcas reports for The Times.\", \"\\u201cHe behaves abhorrently, but there is a deep well of pain there,\\u201d Cumberbatch said of the character. \\u201cIf we don\\u2019t understand the monsters in our world, what motivates this behavior, if we can\\u2019t look at someone beyond being a baddie or a goody, then we\\u2019re in trouble.\\u201d\", \"On set in New Zealand\\u2019s South Island, the actor remained in character even between takes. At what he describes as a \\u201cdude camp,\\u201d he learned to ride, whittle and work with animals, among other new skills: \\u201cBraiding rope, working with the cattle, castrating \\u2014 braiding rope while smoking a cigarette, incredibly difficult!\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI told him, the problem is that you\\u2019re about as English as anyone can get,\\u201d recalled Jane Campion, the film\\u2019s director. \\u201cBut we\\u2019re going to make you an American rancher in 1925.\\u201d\", \"Read more about Cumberbatch\\u2019s process.\", \"After three hours in the pot, the lamb in this Moroccan-inspired tagine is fragrant and tender.\", \"\\u201cSpencer\\u201d is a love story, a horror movie, a psychological thriller and a movie about Princess Diana, all in one, our reviewer writes.\", \"Making rangoli, an ornate floor art, can be a celebratory act for festivals like Diwali and a meditative practice.
