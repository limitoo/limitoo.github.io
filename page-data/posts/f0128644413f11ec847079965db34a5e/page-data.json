We\\u2019ll look at a little-known city agency responsible for monitoring conditions at the city\\u2019s jails. It took no action as deaths increased earlier in the year. We\\u2019ll also look at the resurgence of wildlife in New York City.\", \"Do your job \\u201cbefore someone else dies,\\u201d an advocate pleaded at a meeting of the city Board of Correction, which has the power to monitor the Rikers Island jail complex.\", \"My colleagues Dana Rubinstein and Jonah Bromwich write that the board\\u2019s inaction did not go unnoticed as the death count in city jails rose to 14 this year. The board has issued no notices of violation since the pandemic began, not even after board members documented \\u201chorrible\\u201d conditions while investigating a death at Rikers in April. Many of the board\\u2019s minimum standards \\u2014 including the rules governing personal hygiene and how long detainees were in intake \\u2014 appeared to have been violated.\", \"Then, as conditions worsened in the summer, the board canceled its July meeting and, for lack of a quorum, could not reschedule it for August. When the board finally met in September, advocates\\u2019 frustration was evident. That was when Victoria Phillips, who works with the Urban Justice Center, pleaded for the board to do its work before there were any more deaths.\", \"The board\\u2019s chairwoman, Jennifer Jones Austin, stayed for only an hour, missing most of the five-hour session. She said last week that she had a conflict because the nonprofit organization she runs also had a meeting.\", \"When the board has made critical findings, it often has not shared them. A report on the April investigation was released only through a freedom of information request from the online news organization The City. Another report, on the first three deaths of Rikers detainees from Covid-19, did not become public until a public defender organization sought it, also through the state freedom of information law.\", \"Even then, the board redacted the report\\u2019s recommendations. According to someone who has read the unredacted version, they included releasing more people from jail; keeping the dorms less crowded; and notifying detainees of positive Covid-19 test results within 24 hours.\", \"[As Deaths Rise in N.Y.C. Jails, Oversight Board Fails to Raise Alarm]\", \"A spokesman for the mayor\\u2019s office, Mitch Schwartz, said that the Board of Correction has yet to finish the report on the first Covid deaths from 2020 and added that he was sure the board would be transparent with its ultimate findings. Austin, the board\\u2019s chairwoman, suggested in an interview that the board had not released the report publicly because it was not comprehensive enough. She said the board did not issue a notice of violation, because such a notice \\u201cdoes nothing.\\u201d\", \"In September, as the press began to focus on the number of deaths in city jails, the board released a statement acknowledging the five suicides at Rikers since last November, compared with none in 2018, 2019 and the first 10 months of 2020.\", \"\\u201cThe Board of Correction calls on the City of New York to move with urgency to create a safer environment for persons in custody and staff,\\u201d the statement said.\", \"It was, by some accounts, too little, too late.\", \"\\u201cYes, they did put out a statement,\\u201d said Jennifer Parish, the director of criminal justice advocacy at the Urban Justice Center. \\u201cBut there\\u2019s so much more that could have been happening along the way.\\u201d\", \"Expect another bright day in the low 60s, with clouds moving in tonight and temps dropping to the low 50s.\", \"In effect until Thursday (Veterans Day).\", \"Paul LaCorte, the parent of two children, ages 5 and 7, who attend P.S. 40 in Manhattan, arrived early, hoping to get his children vaccinated at a clinic the city was hosting there.\", \"He stood in line for more than four hours \\u2014 more time than it had taken him to run the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\", \"P.S. 40, in the Gramercy neighborhood, was one of a dozen New York City schools swamped with demand as the city began a weeklong effort to bring a half-day vaccine clinic to each of more than 1,000 schools that serve elementary students.\", \"City officials acknowledged that they were caught off guard by the demand at some schools but said that things went smoothly at most of the 200 clinics operating on Monday.\", \"\\u201cWe laid in supply and staffing for the amount of demand we expected,\\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said. \\u201cIf we\\u2019re seeing more demand, well, that\\u2019s a good thing, but we got to catch up with it quickly.\\u201d\", \"A couple of centuries ago, wildlife luxuriated in the forests and fields of Manhattan, forests and fields that disappeared as the city pushed north. The wildlife largely disappeared, too.\", \"Now naturalists say that wildlife is again luxuriating in New York, and not just in Manhattan. There are beavers on Staten Island, a coyote in Central Park, mink and foxes in the Bronx and exotic insects not seen in Brooklyn in decades.\", \"Even baby damselflies, the world\\u2019s most endangered sea turtles, have taken up residence in Queens.\", \"And there are bald eagles all over the city. Last winter, said Adrian Benepe, a former parks commissioner who is now the president of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, \\u201cthey were in places you haven\\u2019t seen them in generations, and they were hunting in Prospect Park.\\u201d\", \"Why? What drew them back?\", \"It is partly that New York City has abundant food sources and relatively few predators. It is also partly that the city is more environmentally friendly than it was 40 years ago, said Kathryn Heintz, the executive director of the NYC Audubon Society. She credits efforts to clean up and expand parks, rivers, forests and wetlands. This has included planting more trees, wildflowers and grasses that are native to the area, banning pesticides in parks and spending billions to convert former landfills and industrial wastelands into nature sanctuaries.\", \"[Eagles, Beavers, Sea Turtles: Why N.Y.C. Is Humming With Wildlife]\", \"All that has made New York \\u201cthe greenest big city on earth,\\u201d she said \\u2014 a city that is on its way to being \\u201cenvironmentally embracing.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis is a story of multiple decades and a process that takes persistence and patience,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s amazing what has happened in 40 years. Imagine what it\\u2019s going to look like in another 40 years.\\u201d\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"When I was 17, I visited my sister in Brooklyn. After that, I couldn\\u2019t wait to grow up and move to New York City.\", \"While I was visiting, my sister and I went out to dinner in Carroll Gardens. As we stood up to leave, the busboy, out of breath, handed me a bouquet of white roses he had bought on his break and asked me to go out with him.\", \"My sister told him I was too young and was only visiting anyway.\", \"When I eventually returned to the city as an adult, I walked past the space where the restaurant had been and let a wave of nostalgia wash over me.\", \"Not far away, I saw a young man choosing flowers outside a small shop.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019ll like anything,\\u201d I said as I passed him.\", \"He grabbed the cheapest bunch and confessed to being very nervous.\", \"I slipped him a $10 bill from my purse and told him to get the white roses.
