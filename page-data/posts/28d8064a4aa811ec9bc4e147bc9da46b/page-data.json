To facilitate the process, El Salvador's government is working on a securities law, and the first license to operate an exchange would go to Bitfinex, Mow said.\", \"Crypto exchange Bitfinex was listed as the book runner for the bond on a presentation behind Mow.\", \"Once 10 such bonds were issued, $5 billion in bitcoin would be taken off the market for several years, Mow said. \\\"And if you get 10 more countries to do these bonds, that's half of bitcoin's market cap right there.\\\"\", \"The \\\"game theory\\\" on the bonds gave first issuer El Salvador an advantage, Mow argued, saying: \\\"If bitcoin at the five-year mark reaches $US1 million, which I think it will, they will sell bitcoin in two quarters and recoup that $US500m.\\\"\", \"- Reuters\"]","href_hash":"28d8064a4aa811ec9bc4e147bc9da46b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"28d8064a4aa811ec9bc4e147bc9da46b"}},
