With Buck's modest backing, the two opened the first Subway restaurant, then called \\\"Pete's Super Submarines,\\\" in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1965. Its priciest sandwich cost 69 cents.\\u00a0\", \"Three years later, the restaurant changed its name to Subway, and by 1973 Buck and DeLuca were operating 16 sandwich shops throughout the state. They soon decided to franchise the brand, and today the privately held company has more than 40,000 locations around the world. \\u00a0\", \"Buck died on Thursday, according to Subway. He is survived by two sons and five grandchildren. Forbes recently pegged Buck's wealth at $1.7 billion.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We are deeply saddened by the passing of one of Subway's founders, Dr. Peter Buck,\\\" Subway CEO John Chidsey said in a statement. \\\"He was a shining example of a dedicated, hands-on leader, and an integral member of the Subway family. Dr. Buck's devotion to Subway, and his vision for the brand, helped grow it from a singular sandwich shop in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to the world's largest restaurant brand.\\\" \\u00a0\", \"Buck was born in South Portland, Maine, in 1930. He graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, in 1952, and earned a master's degree and doctorate in physics at Columbia University.
