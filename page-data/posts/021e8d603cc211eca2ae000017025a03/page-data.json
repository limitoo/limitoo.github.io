This is wrong.\", \"\\\"His skeleton argument is littered with emotive references to 'child' and 'children.'\", \"\\\"To be clear, this is a man in his 40s, seeking financial support from his elderly parents\\u201469 and 71 years old, respectively.\", \"\\\"It goes without saying that the parents are devastated that they are being put through this ordeal by their son and that they are being put to such enormous expense, particularly when set against their historic and ongoing generosity towards him.\\\"\", \"In 2018, Siddiqui also unsuccessfully tried to sue Oxford University for \\u00a31 million over claims was he prevented from achieving the top honors because of inadequate teachings, which cost him a lucrative career.\", \"Southey has been contacted for comment regarding his client.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1925447/faiz-siddiqui.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Royal Courts of Justice, commonly called the Law Courts, is a court building in London which houses both the High Court and Court of Appeal of England and Wales.
