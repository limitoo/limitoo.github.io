And what better way to stick to that goal than to cook more one-pot meals from New York Times Cooking? This is not permission to compromise on flavor; in fact you\\u2019ll find that these thoughtfully developed recipes brim with warmth, tang, spice and creaminess despite their ease. But when energy is at a premium (and when is it not?), the dishes below will satisfy while keeping the sink relatively empty.\", \"Preparing this 30-minute number from Hetty McKinnon in a single pot actually fortifies the flavors of the overall dish: The stock that deglazes the caramelized mushrooms and leeks is also the liquid that the pasta cooks in, capturing all those browned bits at the bottom of the pot and imparting orecchiette with their umami.\", \"Recipe: Creamy One-Pot Mushroom and Leek Pasta\", \"Zainab Shah skips the more traditional layering of ingredients in biryani to save time and clean up, but she doesn\\u2019t sacrifice flavor. The recipe is packed with aromatics \\u2014 cloves, cardamom pods, green chiles, ginger and chopped herbs, to name just a few \\u2014 and a produce aisle\\u2019s worth of veggies. A final bedazzling of pomegranate seeds and cashews beautifully disguises the fact that this dish is a cinch to prepare.\", \"Recipe: One-Pot Vegetable Biryani\", \"Don\\u2019t sound off in the comments just yet \\u2014 this comforting Melissa Clark recipe calls for ground turkey, but you can also use more beans or your preferred plant-based meat substitute. And while the stew itself is everything you want from a chili (spicy, rich, filling), we all know why you\\u2019re here: the siren call of those buttery, tangy biscuits.\", \"Recipe: One-Pot Turkey Chili and Biscuits\", \"In the universe of vessels that could be considered a singular pot, you can, and should, include the big ol\\u2019 electric pressure cooker. While Sarah DiGregorio\\u2019s vegetarian interpretation of the Hungarian classic is far from what you might find in Budapest, plenty of Yukon Gold potatoes and meaty mushrooms keep it in the comforting spirit of the original.\", \"Recipe: Instant Pot Mushroom and Potato Paprikash\", \"There\\u2019s a good reason people can\\u2019t get enough of this recipe from Ali Slagle when it\\u2019s posted to New York Times Cooking\\u2019s Instagram account: It\\u2019s almost absurd in its simplicity. Not only does the whole affair take about the same time it takes to prepare boxed mac and cheese, but it also requires just five ingredients, not including salt and pepper. Did we mention you don\\u2019t even have to cook the sauce? Wild.\", \"Recipe: One-Pot Pasta With Ricotta and Lemon\", \"Swapping the chicken for red lentils in Ali Slagle\\u2019s vegetarian take on the Italian classic ensures dinner still has plenty of protein with minimal fuss. The final stew is also incredibly versatile: Eat it straight from the pot, spoon it over creamy polenta or treat it as a pasta sauce by thinning it out with just a little bit of water.\", \"Recipe: Lentils Cacciatore\", \"This richly crimson vegetarian stew from Lidey Heuck is well spiced, but lacks the fiery heat one might normally associate with heftier chilies. Instead, the flavor profile is warmer and a bit more complex thanks to subtle additions like cinnamon and brown sugar.\", \"Recipe: Chili With Butternut Squash and Moroccan Spices\", \"Melissa Clark has written a love letter to canned foods, and it\\u2019s this creamy curry. Canned chickpeas, coconut milk and pumpkin pur\\u00e9e serve as the base for this pantry-friendly (and budget-friendly) recipe. Fresh produce is kept to a minimum \\u2014 think onion, cilantro, lime \\u2014 to ensure you won\\u2019t have to dash out for a last-minute ingredient.\", \"Recipe: Coconut Curry Chickpeas With Pumpkin and Lime\", \"Ali Slagle is out here asking the important questions \\u2014 like \\u201cWhat if my favorite steakhouse creamed spinach teamed up with my favorite mac and cheese?\\u201d \\u2014 and giving the people answers. Here, milk, spinach and aromatics create a sauce that\\u2019s loose enough for tiny pasta like ditalini to cook in, but that also thickens as it simmers. A final showering of Parmesan binds it all together perfectly.\", \"Recipe: One-Pot Creamy Pasta and Greens\", \"Loophole alert! Because the cheesy toasts served alongside this Italian stew from Sarah DiGregorio are popped right under the broiler sans pot or pan, it still qualifies for this list. Don\\u2019t skip them, either: While the soup is hearty on its own, reviving any stale bread laying around means you\\u2019ll get bites here and there that are almost pizzalike in flavor.\", \"Recipe: Pressure Cooker Ribollita With Smoked Mozzarella Toasts\", \"If there\\u2019s a tube or jar of harissa in the pantry, put it to work in this breezy weeknight soup from Ali Slagle. Because the North African chile paste carries a good amount of heat and flavor in just a couple tablespoons, you won\\u2019t need much else besides a few crisper staples and a couple cans of chickpeas to get dinner on the table in 30 minutes.\", \"Recipe: Chickpea Harissa Soup\", \"This creamy, vibrant and piquant soup doesn\\u2019t actually require any cream: Yewande Komolafe uses coconut milk, natural peanut butter and pumpkin pur\\u00e9e to achieve a silky consistency. Those velvety ingredients also temper the heat of some habanero chile, a fixture of West African cuisine.\", \"Recipe: Spicy Peanut and Pumpkin Soup\", \"Kay Chun makes dinner \\u2014 and thus, life \\u2014 so much easier for you with this recipe, which eliminates the need for the stovetop hovering and endless stirring often associated with risotto. This dish is easy to adapt, too: While chicken stock is called for, mushroom broth would be an exceptional substitution.\", \"Recipe: Baked Risotto With Greens and Peas\", \"Doenjang, the Korean fermented soybean paste, lends a salty funk that brings complexity to an otherwise simple stew of pantry beans and hearty greens. Eric Kim keeps waste to a minimum by including the stems from the greens \\u2014 specifically rainbow chard \\u2014 which add color and a subtle crunch.\", \"Recipe: Beans and Greens Stew With Doenjang\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
