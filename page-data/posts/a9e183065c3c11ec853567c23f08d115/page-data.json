He told Yahoo News that the practice was routine, saying, \\\"When a name comes across your desk you run it through every system you have access too, that's just status quo, that's what everyone does,\\\" Yahoo News reports he told investigators.\", \"The AP vetted the existence of this statement by obtaining a redacted copy of a 500-plus-page report by the Department Homeland Security's inspector general that showed the same statement with the name blacked out.\", \"Rambo played a central role in the division's in the vetting of former Politico and current New York Times reporter Ali Watkins. The AP writes that, after approaching Watkins to gauge her interest about reporting on forced labor around the world within the context of U.S. national security, Rambo accessed Watkins' travel records which led him to question her about relationships she had with sources.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950490/passports-required-next-week.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The report states that this technology may have been used to investigate as many as 20 reporters.
