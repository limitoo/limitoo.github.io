Contemplating himself from a distance, he continued: \\u201cThat guy, he\\u2019s got some experience in his life. He\\u2019s got some hardships. There are murderous qualities in that resting face of his.\\u201d\", \"That being said, \\u201cCan I also do a Disney film?\\u201d he added. \\u201cHell yeah, I can do a Disney film. I\\u2019m not the king of darkness here.\\u201d\", \"Audiences can see that duality on display this month when Renner \\u2014 who has not played a continuing TV role in more than a decade \\u2014 stars in two very different streaming series, debuting 10 days apart.\", \"Last Sunday, Renner was introduced as Mike McLusky, the disconsolate protagonist of \\u201cMayor of Kingstown,\\u201d a new Paramount+ series from the \\u201cYellowstone\\u201d co-creator Taylor Sheridan, about the interconnected lives in a fictional Michigan city centered on a prison.\", \"On Wednesday, he will return to the role of Clint Barton, the wisecracking marksman of the Avengers, in \\u201cHawkeye,\\u201d a six-episode mini-series on Disney+.\", \"\\u201cHawkeye\\u201d promises the signature buoyancy of the Marvel franchise, with its alternating beats of one-liners and explosions, as well as some narrative consequence. Renner was particularly amused by its contrasts with \\u201cMayor of Kingstown.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis is sweet, light fare,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s some heaviness to it, don\\u2019t get me wrong. But comparatively, \\u2018Mayor of Kingstown\\u2019 is going to hit people with a hammer.\\u201d\", \"That he can star in both shows \\u2014 that creators and audiences accept him in projects that are popular and that are personal, playing men of decisive deeds and men with internalized conflicts \\u2014 is a source of both puzzlement and delight to him.\", \"He has been moving on these parallel tracks for many years, well before he fired his first arrow in a Marvel movie. Now a combination of eclectic choices and unexpected circumstances have led the 50-year-old Renner to this pair of prominent streaming projects \\u2014 an outcome that he finds satisfying, even if he\\u2019s not sure what it says about him or the vagaries of sustaining a lengthy Hollywood career.\", \"\\u201cSome people just know me as Hawkeye,\\u201d Renner said. \\u201cSome people go a little deeper \\u2014 \\u2018He was also Jeffrey Dahmer, he was nominated for this, he\\u2019s actually a proper actor.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cEither way, I don\\u2019t care. That\\u2019s awesome, either way you see me.\\u201d\", \"In late October, Renner was speaking in a video interview from his home in Los Angeles as he sipped from a mug bearing the letters TCB, as in the Elvis Presley motto Taking Care of Business. He had wrapped shooting on \\u201cMayor of Kingstown\\u201d a few weeks earlier \\u2014 an assignment he\\u2019d gone on to immediately after finishing \\u201cHawkeye\\u201d \\u2014 and was still feeling the impact of those consecutive projects.\", \"\\u201cIt took a toll on me,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI had no life, ultimately. I was always on set or in character or in costume on one of the shows.\\u201d\", \"Constant activity is something of a default state for Renner, who outside of his acting has kept busy with real-estate investments, a collection of cars and motorcycles and recording his own music.\", \"He did, however, have to pull the plug on another side project, the Jeremy Renner Official mobile app, an online platform that shared news, photos and other content about him but became a target for internet trolls. \\u201cIt just became more complicated than it needed to be for my life,\\u201d Renner explained. \\u201cI\\u2019m still proud of the idea to give more time to superfans, the will behind it. But I just don\\u2019t have the time or capacity to do it.\\u201d\", \"He was just as frenetic in his earliest days as a theater actor, as he pivoted from playing the Scarecrow in a Modesto Junior College production of \\u201cThe Wizard of Oz\\u201d to parts in Lyle Kessler\\u2019s brutal thriller \\u201cOrphans\\u201d and as a suicidal teenager in a stage version of \\u201cOrdinary People.\\u201d\", \"Even as Renner began to break through in film and television, he was reluctant to contemplate what his dream roles were \\u2014 if he had any at all. \\u201cMaybe 10, 15 years ago, I was like, it\\u2019d be cool to be a cowboy in a Western,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019d be cool to be in sci-fi. But that\\u2019s just an ego thing \\u2014 those are only words.\\u201d\", \"And then in short order he fulfilled all those goals, delivering memorable performances in movies like \\u201c28 Weeks Later\\u201d and \\u201cThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.\\u201d\", \"When Marvel started considering him for Hawkeye, Renner was riding high from \\u201cThe Town,\\u201d a Boston crime thriller, and \\u201cThe Hurt Locker,\\u201d an anxious Iraq War drama, and the studio believed he could bring a strain of realism to contrast with fantastical characters like Iron Man, Captain America and Thor.\", \"Kevin Feige, the Marvel Studios president, said that Renner was sought to supply \\u201cthe human element of \\u2018The Avengers\\u2019 \\u2014 the Everyman who gets banged and bruised up, who can\\u2019t fly and still runs into battle with the best of them.\\u201d\", \"He added, \\u201cIt needed an actor who could stay grounded despite the insanity surrounding him, and also have a wry sense of humor while doing that.\\u201d\", \"Renner took on the role and the multiyear commitment it meant, grateful that it offered him the freedom to be more selective about his non-Marvel work. \\u201cI got to make very specific choices and easier choices,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t have to do a big picture. I can just do what makes sense for me.\\u201d\", \"He acknowledged some frustration with the first \\u201cAvengers\\u201d film, which Hawkeye largely spent as an unwilling villain under the spell of the nefarious Loki. Renner said he felt like little more than \\u201cone of the cogs in the wheel.\\u201d But the sequels, which explored Clint Barton\\u2019s love for his family \\u2014 and his desire for revenge when they are erased from existence \\u2014 satisfied Renner\\u2019s desire for a more well-rounded character.\", \"In our own conversation, Renner remarked more than once that going straight from \\u201cHawkeye\\u201d (which filmed in New York and Atlanta) to \\u201cMayor of Kingstown\\u201d (which was shot in Toronto and in Kingston, Ontario) had been grueling, and that he might not have taken on the workload if he hadn\\u2019t been able to bring his 8-year-old daughter, Ava, to these locations. (Renner shares custody of Ava with his ex-wife, the model and actress Sonni Pacheco, with whom he has exchanged some contentious legal filings over the years.)\", \"In 2017, Renner starred in \\u201cWind River,\\u201d a thriller in the mode of a modern-day Western. The film was written and directed by Sheridan, the actor-turned-screenwriter (\\u201cSicario,\\u201d \\u201cHell or High Water\\u201d), and during its production he and Renner bonded over shared sensibilities. When Paramount enlisted Sheridan to produce more content for the studio\\u2019s streaming service, he pursued Renner to star in \\u201cMayor of Kingstown.\\u201d (Sheridan created that series with Hugh Dillon, one of its co-stars.)\", \"\\u201cAt the end of the day, I make highfalutin action films,\\u201d Sheridan said. \\u201cI make \\u2018Road House\\u2019 with a message. I need someone that has the physicality and the intensity, but also the vulnerability.\\u201d\", \"Sheridan added, \\u201cMy characters begin broken and then heal, and there\\u2019s an innate sadness that he can give them.\\u201d\", \"In \\u201cMayor of Kingstown,\\u201d Renner\\u2019s character, McLusky, works with his brother Mitch (Kyle Chandler) as a go-between for prison workers, inmates and their families, which gives him unique inroads to the city\\u2019s intertwined power systems. \\u201cIn order to truly advocate for them, you\\u2019ve got to have relationships with the people who control them,\\u201d Sheridan explained. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to have relationships with the mobsters, with the judges, with the police.\\u201d\", \"Renner said he had been drawn to the show for its commentary on the American penal system and the for-profit incarceration industry. He said he also appreciated the opportunity to play a character like McLusky, who may seem to have a measure of control over Kingstown but is at the mercy of forces larger than himself.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s there to be the voice of reason \\u2014 or reasonability, anyway \\u2014 and then he\\u2019s there to clean up the messes of other people that have the ultimate say,\\u201d Renner said.\", \"Before filming \\u201cMayor of Kingstown,\\u201d Renner had signed on for \\u201cHawkeye,\\u201d a six-episode mini-series that grew out of an earlier agreement to make a stand-alone Marvel film about that character.\", \"\\u201cHawkeye,\\u201d which takes some inspiration from an inventive run on the comic-book series by the writer Matt Fraction and artists including David Aja, is set primarily after the events of the 2019 blockbuster \\u201cAvengers: Endgame.\\u201d The show focuses on the unlikely partnership that develops between Barton and Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), a young woman at the center of a high-society mystery whom he reluctantly takes on as his prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9e.\", \"Steinfeld said that Renner was understanding about her lack of experience in the big-budget Marvel universe. In one of their first conversations on the project, Steinfeld said, she asked him a na\\u00efve question about archery.\", \"\\u201cI was like, \\u2018You\\u2019re going to have to teach me a thing or two,\\u2019\\u201d she recalled. \\u201cHe just started laughing and was like, \\u2018Listen, you\\u2019re never actually going to shoot the arrow \\u2014 it will be C.G.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"While Steinfeld was also finishing work on the final season of her Apple TV+ series, \\u201cDickinson,\\u201d it was comforting, she said, to have a scene partner in Renner who, like her, was trying to manage the demands of making two shows back-to-back.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re here, and we have no choice but to fully be here, right now,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut at a certain point, you have to start getting your head in place for the next thing. At what point do we mentally make that switch? It\\u2019s very tough, and it\\u2019s nice to have somebody going through something similar.\\u201d\", \"Emma Laird, a co-star on \\u201cMayor of Kingstown,\\u201d said that her work on that series was often emotionally demanding. She noted that all the years Renner had spent on the effects-intensive Marvel movies had not diminished his touch with normal human co-stars.\", \"\\u201cThere was one scene where he\\u2019s holding me and, in between takes, all he did was just give me a little pat on the shoulder to let me know he was there,\\u201d Laird said. \\u201cAnd it just meant everything to me. When you\\u2019re working opposite a tennis ball, it\\u2019s easy as an actor to be like, well, I don\\u2019t care. But he really supported me in ways he didn\\u2019t have to.\\u201d\", \"Between the two new series, Renner expected that \\u201cHawkeye\\u201d would likely be \\u201cthe flashier one,\\u201d but he also said that he hoped viewers would not be dissuaded from \\u201cMayor of Kingstown\\u201d by its starker exterior.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m always hesitant to say, \\u2018This is dark, it\\u2019s harrowing, it\\u2019s bleak,\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt sounds depressing and no one wants to watch it. We\\u2019re not asking people to follow the bleakness \\u2014 you follow the hope of the people who are trying to escape from this environment or make it better. It\\u2019s actually very beautiful to watch.\\u201d\", \"He was confident that there would be more seasons of \\u201cMayor of Kingstown\\u201d in his future and that, whatever the outcome of \\u201cHawkeye,\\u201d he would surely be playing Clint Barton again.\", \"\\u201cI can make that live for another decade,\\u201d Renner said. \\u201cUntil I just can\\u2019t fit into the damn costume anymore.\\u201d As for acting as a whole, he said, \\u201cI\\u2019ll do it till no one wants to see me do it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"11f8f121494d11eca672ddc4e79e3a0d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"11f8f121494d11eca672ddc4e79e3a0d"}},
