That will clear the way for a launch attempt at 7:20 a.m.  EST Saturday, the opening of a 32-minute window.\", \"Engineers  originally planned to launch Webb, the largest and most expensive  science probe ever built, on December 18. But the flight was delayed four  days because of problems with a rocket attachment fitting and then  another two days due to trouble with data drop outs in a telemetry  cable.\", \"NASA and ESA then reset launch for  Christmas Eve, only to order another delay to at least Saturday because  of stormy weather. After reviewing the weather outlook again on  Wednesday, mission managers confirmed the December 25 target date.\", \"The  James Webb Space Telescope is designed to capture infrared light from  the first stars and galaxies to form in the aftermath of the Big Bang  some 13.8 billion years ago.\", \"If all goes well,  the Ariane 5 will put the observatory on a trajectory toward a parking  spot a million miles from Earth on the far side of the moon where it can  operate in a sort of gravitational eddy, cooled to within a few degrees  of absolute zero using a sunshade the size of a tennis court.\", \"Folded  up to fit inside the Ariane 5's nose cone, Webb's five-layer sunshade,  its segmented primary mirror and a secondary mirror mounted on a folding  tripod, are scheduled to unfold and lock into place during the first  two-and-a-half weeks after launch.\", \"Unlike the  Hubble Space Telescope, which could be serviced by spacewalking shuttle  astronauts, Webb will be beyond the reach of any foreseeable service  calls.\", \"Tension is high.\", \"\\\"The  team's work is not stopping on launch day, there's a lot of hard, long  weeks ahead where the telescope has to deploy perfectly to begin this  amazing work,\\\" said Deputy NASA Administrator Pam Melroy, a former space  shuttle commander.\", \"\\\"So stay tuned for updates  as we move this observatory out into space,\\\" she said earlier this week.  \\\"This is a high-risk and a very high-payoff program. We've done  everything we can think of to make Webb successful. And now we just need  to go do it.\\\"\", \"Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News. He covered 129 space shuttle missions, every interplanetary flight since Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune and scores of commercial and military launches.
