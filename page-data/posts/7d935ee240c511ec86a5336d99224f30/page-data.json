Trump was banned from Twitter early this year, Brazil\\u2019s like-minded leader made a plea to his millions of followers on the site.\", \"\\u201cSign up for my official channel on Telegram,\\u201d President Jair Bolsonaro requested.\", \"Since then, Telegram, an encrypted messaging and social media platform run by an elusive Russian exile, has racked up tens of millions of new users in Brazil.\", \"Its growing popularity in Brazil and elsewhere is being fueled by conservative politicians and commentators for whom it has become the most permissive disseminator of problematic content \\u2014 including disinformation \\u2014 in a social media ecosystem facing mounting pressure to combat fake news and polarization.\", \"While WhatsApp remains by far the dominant messaging platform in Brazil, Telegram is making inroads fast. By August, it had been installed in 53 percent of all smartphones in Brazil, up from 15 percent two years earlier, according to a report.\", \"Founded in 2013, Telegram has become a tool coveted by activists, dissidents and politicians \\u2014 many in repressive nations like Iran and Cuba \\u2014 to communicate privately.\", \"But Brazilian government officials and experts worry the app could become a powerful vector for lies and vitriol before next year\\u2019s presidential elections \\u2014 a tense political moment in the country.\", \"Mr. Bolsonaro, his re-election prospects endangered by his diminishing popularity, has followed the Trump playbook and begun sowing doubts about the integrity of Brazil\\u2019s voting system, raising the possibility of a disputed outcome. His unfounded claim that electronic voting machines will be rigged has unnerved the opposition and the country\\u2019s top judges, who say the abundance of disinformation in Brazilian politics is doing lasting damage to its democracy.\", \"\\u201cWe know that systemic disinformation is produced by structures that are very well organized and financed,\\u201d said Aline Os\\u00f3rio, a secretary general at Brazil\\u2019s electoral court who heads its program against misinformation.\", \"Ms. Os\\u00f3rio said the court had established constructive working relationships with executives from other social media companies that have become vehicles for misinformation campaigns. But its efforts to reach Telegram, which is based in Dubai, have been unsuccessful.\", \"\\u201cTelegram has no representatives in Brazil, and this has made it difficult to establish a partnership in the same way we\\u2019ve done with other platforms,\\u201d she said.\", \"Telegram did not respond to a request for an interview. Press queries are submitted through a bot on the platform.\", \"Experts say political content and conversations have migrated substantially to Telegram in recent years in Brazil and other countries, largely because of the app\\u2019s capacity to mass-reproduce content.\", \"Group chats can include up to 200,000 users, exponentially more than WhatsApp\\u2019s limit of 256. WhatsApp curbed users\\u2019 ability to forward messages after coming under criticism in Brazil and elsewhere for the role it played in misinformation campaigns during recent elections.\", \"In addition to group chats, Telegram hosts channels, a one-way mass-communication tool used by corporations, artists and politicians to distribute messages, videos and audio files. Mr. Bolsonaro\\u2019s channel surpassed one million followers in recent weeks, putting him among the world\\u2019s most followed politicians on the platform.\", \"While rival apps have adopted stricter and more clearly defined policies on abuse and disinformation, Telegram\\u2019s guidelines are vague, and the service takes a hands-off approach to content in individual and group chats.\", \"That makes it a safe space for incendiary figures, including politicians, who have been banned from other platforms. In Brazil, the Twitter and Instagram accounts of a lawmaker, Daniel Silveira, and a conservative journalist, Allan dos Santos, were suspended as part of a Supreme Court investigation into disinformation campaigns that included threats against justices.\", \"But Telegram remains a portal to their followers. That has enabled Mr. dos Santos to raise funds for his legal defense and call the justice who got him banned from other sites a \\u201cpsychopath.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe network is clearly benefiting from the removal of users from other platforms,\\u201d Fabr\\u00edcio Benevenuto, a computer science professor at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, said of Telegram. \\u201cPoliticians have noticed it makes no effort to remove accounts, so it is becoming an appealing network for more radical groups.\\u201d\", \"Farzaneh Badiei, an internet governance expert who published a paper on Telegram at Yale Law School this year, said that Telegram\\u2019s founder, Pavel Durov, had been unwilling to meaningfully grapple with the problem of disinformation that goes viral.\", \"\\u201cTheir approach is very disorganized and very opaque,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t see a systemic approach to solving these problems.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Durov left Russia in 2014 after battling government efforts to censor content on the social networking site he founded, VKontakte. He has said he designed Telegram as an ultra private means of communicating based on the persecution he says he endured in his native country.\", \"Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and YouTube played critical roles in Mr. Bolsonaro\\u2019s stunning victory in 2018, and the far-right leader has continued to rely heavily on social media to energize his base, attack opponents and make false claims that go largely unchallenged.\", \"But in recent months, the platforms that enabled Mr. Bolsonaro\\u2019s rise have reined him in over his false or misleading claims about measures to contain the coronavirus. Social media companies put him on notice by taking down a handful of videos and tweets that they deemed dangerous.\", \"Mr. Bolsonaro and his followers have railed against those removals as forms of censorship. In September, he argued that disinformation was now a permanent feature of politics and dismissed it as a trivial issue.\", \"\\u201cFake news is part of our life,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWho has never told a little lie to their girlfriend?\\u201d\", \"Telegram has drawn critical scrutiny in Brazil for more than its disruptive role in politics. Investigations by news organizations found that it was hosting illegal arms networks and enabling the distribution of child pornography.\", \"Brazilian lawmakers are debating legislation that would require platforms like Telegram to have legal representation in Brazil or risk being banned. However, users have easily circumvented such bans in countries like Iran and Russia by using software that lets them disguise their location.\", \"Diogo Rais, a professor at Mackenzie University in S\\u00e3o Paulo and a co-founder of the Digital Freedom Institute, called blocking apps a \\u201cdrastic measure\\u201d that would be ineffective.\", \"\\u201cWe need to deal with digital challenges realizing that our laws are from 2009 and limited to our physical territory,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe digital world has no such limit. This is a global challenge.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"7d935ee240c511ec86a5336d99224f30"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7d935ee240c511ec86a5336d99224f30"}},
