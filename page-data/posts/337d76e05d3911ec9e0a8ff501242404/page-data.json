The decision came after a two-year investigation from Manhattan's district attorney found that Aziz, 83, and Islam, who has since died, were wrongfully convicted.\", \"\\\"As a result of his wrongful conviction and imprisonment, Mr. Aziz spent 20 years in prison for a crime he did not commit and more than 55 years living with the hardship and indignity attendant to being unjustly branded as a convicted murderer of one of the most important civil rights leaders in history,\\\" the lawsuit stated.\", \"Attorney's for Aziz said that they also filed a document that's a precursor to a $40 million lawsuit against New York City and other individuals. A similar action is expected to be filed on behalf of Islam's estate.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"While I do not dwell on what my life might have been like had this travesty of justice never occurred, the deep and lasting trauma it caused cannot be overstated. The more than 20 years that I spent in prison were stolen from me and my family, and while the official record now recognizes the truth that has been known for decades, nothing can undo the damage that my wrongful conviction caused to all of us,\\\" Aziz said in a statement provided by his attorneys. \\\"Those responsible for depriving me of my liberty and for depriving my family of a husband, a father, and a grandfather should be held accountable.\\\"\", \"Malcolm X was fatally shot while giving a speech at New York's Audubon Ballroom on February 21, 1965.

Full descriptions of the men, and particularly the man who wielded the shotgun. That was information that was not given to the NYPD,\\\" Bertelsen said.\", \"The lawsuit is the first action taken by Aziz to receive monetary relief since the clearing of his record and \\\"represents a modicum of compensation for the destruction wrought by this grievous miscarriage of justice,\\\" according to the filing.\\u00a0\", \"The New York Attorney General's office declined to comment on the lawsuit.\\u00a0\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"337d76e05d3911ec9e0a8ff501242404"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"337d76e05d3911ec9e0a8ff501242404"}},
