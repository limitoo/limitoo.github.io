The basement is always locked, she said, and she does not have a key. \\u201cI would advise to run to the subway\\u201d instead, she added with a shrug.\", \"Kyiv \\u2014 a jumble of medieval churches, cobblestone streets and sprawling outlying districts of high-rise apartment buildings \\u2014 is a city coming to grips this holiday season with the newest additions to its urban environment: bomb shelters.\", \"Many people ignore them. Others are worried. But the general nonchalance of residents highlights a peculiar aspect of the tensions with Russia. Western governments, analysts and military experts appear to have taken the threat far more seriously than ordinary Ukrainians.\", \"Hardened by years of smoldering war in their country\\u2019s east, and in any case not inclined to contemplate catastrophe right before the holiday, many have put the risk out of mind.\", \"\\u201cPeople don\\u2019t believe Russia will invade,\\u201d said Svitlana Zalishchuk, a former member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of Ukraine\\u2019s Parliament. \\u201cIt\\u2019s such an outrageous thing, you simply cannot reconcile it\\u201d with ordinary life, she added.\", \"Indeed, a kind of gallows humor has set in among some across Kyiv. Instead of saying, \\u201cSee you after the holidays\\u201d \\u2014 the usual farewell among colleagues before New Year\\u2019s Eve \\u2014 some say, \\u201cSee you after the invasion.\\u201d\", \"It is not frivolity or a casual disregard for potential danger so much as fatigue and a determination to press on in a modern, bustling city of three million people. The United States government has said that Russia has plans for an invasion, but that there is no indication that President Vladimir V. Putin has decided to execute them.\", \"\\u201cDefinitely the situation is very dangerous, and it is escalating, but at the same time, we are living in this situation for seven years,\\u201d Hanna Shelest, the editor in chief of the academic journal Ukraine Analytica, said at a panel discussion this month, referring to the continuing war in the east pitting Ukrainian troops against Russian-backed separatists.\", \"\\u201cFrom the inside it looks less dangerous, probably, than from the outside,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThat is the basis of crisis psychology: The person in the accident usually is less afraid than people who are watching.\\u201d\", \"The relatively calm atmosphere can also be traced to a decision by President Volodymyr Zelensky not to put the nation on a war footing with public announcements about conflict. Doing so would admit that opposition political parties who have been sounding the alarm for months were right all along. It is also seen as an effort to prevent panic, even as the government has stepped up military training for civilians to resist a possible invasion.\", \"So, Ukrainians are being asked to carry on and draw their own conclusions from the blend of the ordinary and the alarming, like the appearance of bomb shelter signs in public places like coffee shops.\", \"There are plenty of reminders of a potential conflict, if people care to notice. Along with the festive lights and caroling in the streets, Kyiv residents can take in a program on television about duct taping window glass to prevent flying shards.\", \"The City Council has advised residents to read instructions for what to do if bombs start falling, or if \\u201can emergency situation of a military nature\\u201d arises: Residents are to remain calm, not wear a military uniform in the street and stay away from windows. And it has published its map of possible shelters, including offices, restaurants, bars and apartment buildings with basements \\u2014 like Raisa Pryshchepa\\u2019s home.\", \"The basement of her building is now a designated bomb shelter, and as superintendent, Ms. Pryshchepa, 68, keeps the key.\", \"\\u201cOh, do not scare me!\\u201d she said when asked if she would be ready to open the makeshift shelter in case of a bombing. She lives on the seventh floor, and the basement, a cramped space underneath a tangle of plumbing pipes, is ordinarily locked.\", \"Ms. Pryshchepa said she would try to make it quickly down the stairs if an invasion came. \\u201cI guess I will have to run,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIf needed, I will make it.\\u201d\", \"The city government categorizes bomb shelters by their levels of protection. The highest level is supposed to withstand a direct strike from artillery or an aerial bomb. Ms. Pryshchepa\\u2019s basement is near the lowest category, meaning it protects from shrapnel sprays from explosions, but not much else.\", \"There are other options for bomb shelters nearby, including the basement of a fish restaurant.\", \"Asked whether it would be possible to take shelter in the restaurant\\u2019s basement in case of bombing, a woman who answered the phone there said that, yes, it would. But it is also a storage area, where, among other things, \\u201cwe keep our herring,\\u201d which they had no plans to move.\", \"Other neighborhoods have better options. Roman Tkachuk, the director of the city\\u2019s Municipal Security Department, recently led journalists around a site with a high level of protection: a Cold War-era nuclear bomb shelter on the outskirts of Kyiv.\", \"Several heavy metal doors opened with deadbolts turned by wheels. Two flights of stairs led down to a bunker, where the furniture is covered in light green upholstery. Metal water canisters are on hand. It can shelter 350 people.\", \"But most people are expected to resort to the cobwebby basements of apartment buildings \\u2014 or to the subway.\", \"Alyona Marfina, 25, was selling Christmas decorations on a recent evening near a subway entrance. But, glancing at the holiday crowd packing in, she said she would not choose a dark, dusty basement. \\u201cI would be scared,\\u201d she said.\", \"Ms. Martina said she had not thought where she might go, and in fact, she had not been taking the preparations very seriously.\", \"\\u201cI heard there was a war,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t think about it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"507d0c6c698f11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"507d0c6c698f11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
