But videos, photos and other details about the decorations are available for viewing at WhiteHouse.gov/Holidays.\", \"\\\"Gifts from the Heart\\\" is the theme.\", \"\\\"The things we hold sacred unite us and transcend distance, time, and even the constraints of a pandemic: faith, family, and friendship; a love of the arts, learning, and nature; gratitude, service, and community; unity and peace,\\\" the Bidens say in a commemorative 2021 White House holiday guidebook. \\\"These are the gifts that tie together the heartstrings of our lives. These are the gifts from the heart.\\\"\", \"The first lady, a longtime community college professor, invited Maryland second graders to help her unveil decorations matching the theme Monday afternoon.
