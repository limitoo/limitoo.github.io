The truck driver isn't facing criminal charges. It's thought that Stewart's screams might have been muffled by the loud sound of the truck's machinery.\", \"\\\"[Stewart] died of crushing injuries consistent with the equipment used to transport garbage,\\\" according to Coroner Jim Allmon, the State Journal-Register reported. \\\"His injuries show he was alive when the injuries were sustained. It sounds terrible, but we don't think anybody put him in there.\\\"\", \"Investigators are awaiting the results of a toxicology blood test to determine whether Stewart was intoxicated at the time of his death. The test results won't return for four to six weeks.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949748/homeless-man-crushed-garbage-truck-illinois.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A homeless man who was found crushed inside of garbage truck may have been sleeping in a dumpster before his death.

The experience \\\"was absolutely the worst pain I had ever felt in my life,\\\" he wrote.\", \"\\\"I began to black out,\\\" he wrote. \\\"Just when I thought, 'I'm going to die. I'm going to die' the compactor moved back toward the back of the truck.
