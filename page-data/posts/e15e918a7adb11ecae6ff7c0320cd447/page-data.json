She curates book-fueled exhibitions that comment on social life. \\u201cEverything, for me, starts with reading,\\u201d Ms. Deering said. \\u201cWriters and artists have always been in conversation with each other. Books give me a tool to think about the importance of art.\\u201d Her first group exhibition in 2019, \\u201cDo You Love Me?,\\u201d focused on \\u201cthe unbalanced power dynamic between those that desire love and those in our culture who have the power to give it,\\u201d she said.\", \"Big Break: Ms. Deering unofficially began her art world internship at age 8, when her mother, Wendy Olsoff, one of PPOW\\u2019s founders, took her to Art Basel in Switzerland, the Venice Biennale in Italy, and various artists\\u2019 studios. In 2016, while working as an assistant at Gladstone Gallery, she started a roving art collective, Duplex, with Sydney Fishman.
