changes to entry requirements for interstate travellers.\", \"From December 20, all interstate arrivals to the Northern Territory\\u00a0will have to comply with the same set of rules, regardless of whether they've been in Perth or Melbourne.\", \"Everyone will need to be fully vaccinated and return three negative PCR tests.\", \"But a new set of regulations, announced this afternoon, will affect people who want to travel to iconic locations \\u2014 such as\\u00a0Kakadu National Park or Uluru \\u2014 in the first two weeks after\\u00a0entering the territory.\", \"They'll also impact when remote residents and essential workers can return\\u00a0home.\", \"Here's a break down of the new changes.\", \"<img

\"But, from Monday, no one will need to home quarantine in the Northern Territory, no matter where they have come from.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Can travellers go to Kakadu?</div>\", \"Yes.\", \"Under the old rules, interstate arrivals to the Northern Territory\\u00a0needed to stay in \\\"high-vaccination zones\\\" for their first 14 days, which meant they were restricted to Greater Darwin, Alice Springs, and Katherine.\", \"This meant tourists were banned from travelling to remoter places, including Uluru or Litchfield National Park.\", \"But these rules have now changed.\", \"Interstate arrivals will now be allowed to visit national parks but are banned from entering remote communities where fewer than 80 per cent of eligible residents are fully vaccinated.\", \"There are 66 remote communities across the Northern Territory where\\u00a0vaccination rates are under this benchmark, and they're listed on the NT Health website.\", \"<img

\"But there will be some extra COVID-safe measures in place.\", \"New arrivals will need to do their second PCR test, the one they need to take within the first 72 hours of arriving in the Northern Territory, before they travel to their community.\", \"But they don't have to wait for the result before they head home to keep vulnerable residents safe.\", \"Travellers\\u00a0will have already
