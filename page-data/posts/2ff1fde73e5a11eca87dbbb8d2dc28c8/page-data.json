The most recent figures reported by World Population Review place Mexico's homicide rate at 29 deaths per 100,000, well above the U.S. figure of five deaths per 100,000.\", \"Mauricio Ibarra Ponce de Le\\u00f3n, Mexico's consul general in El Paso, Texas, told Border Report that part of the reason for this phenomenon is that the drug cartels have been able to get their hands on firearms, despite the nation's strict gun laws.\", \"\\\"We estimate that half a million weapons are trafficked from the U.S. to Mexico every year,\\\" Ibarra told Border Report. \\\"The problem is that all this weaponry is getting to the criminal organizations, giving them very strong firepower to commit all kinds of crimes.\\\"\", \"Mexico's gun laws are far stricter than that those in the U.S. The country has one army-run gun store that issues a few hundred licenses each year.

Rather than entering the country by truck or plane, the guns are purchased in border states like Texas or California by individuals who visit gun stores repeatedly, according to Border Report.\", \"To combat this, Mexico has filed a suit directed at American gun manufacturers in a Massachusetts federal court, in hopes of achieving greater accountability.\", \"Recently in El Paso, a case file details how one local man allegedly purchased 49 guns and rifles from 12 dealers and was caught attempting to bring them to Mexico shortly afterward.\", \"\\\"We have never meddled with the Second Amendment. This is not against the rights of the people of the United States to buy and own a gun,\\\" Ibarra told Border Report. \\\"We [sued] gun manufacturers and distributors we believe are engaging in negligent commercial practices because they know the weaponry they produce is being trafficked to Mexico and is being used in criminal activity.\\\"\", \"The civil case in Massachusetts will be heard on November 22.\"]","href_hash":"2ff1fde73e5a11eca87dbbb8d2dc28c8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2ff1fde73e5a11eca87dbbb8d2dc28c8"}},
