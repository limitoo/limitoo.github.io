It seemed like such an outlandish idea.\", \"But hundreds showed up at Bethesda Fountain to sing the emotional anthem from \\u201cSunday in the Park With George.\\u201d Steven Cuevas, who volunteered to conduct, asked the participants to listen to one another and pay attention to the lyrics. And then without a rehearsal, a pack of strangers following along on sheet music handouts sang in soaring, resonant harmony.\", \"\\u201cIt was so spontaneous, yet so fully formed,\\u201d Mr. Bustamante said.\", \"It was one of dozens of moments of group singing that have returned to a newly appreciative city in recent months. Singing in public was one of the first activities to go when Covid-19 arrived, and because of the dangerous aerosols it can spray, it has been one of the last to come back. But even now, as the Omicron variant brings new concerns, hundreds of choirs are continuing to rehearse across New York. Piano and karaoke bars have reopened. Congregations are filling the rafters with hymns and psalms. And children in schools are rehearsing for holiday concerts again.\", \"\\u201cIt is so lovely to have our students back together and hear their voices echoing in our hallways,\\u201d said Frank Proudfoot, assistant principal of the Brooklyn High School of the Arts, which has several choruses. \\u201cThe first time I could walk into a room and hear them rehearsing again was as exciting as hearing them in a performance.\\u201d\", \"For Catherine Morrison, a 29-year-old alto with the West Village Chorale, a return to the choir was like a return to family. \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing like that full resonance that comes from blended choral singing,\\u201d she said.\", \"Medical studies show that singing has all kinds of positive effects on the body and mind. It strengthens the lungs, the spirit and the memory. It fosters collaboration and community and it can help alleviate anxiety and loneliness.\", \"The fact that group singing became a dangerous superspreader was a prolonged and punishing blow to devoted participants whether in gospel choirs, karaoke rooms or piano bars. \", \"Now that group singing is back in the city, regulation varies depending on the venue, with vaccination proof the one consistent rule. At Sid\\u2019s Gold Request Room in Chelsea, a clear plastic sheet separates pianists from participants who lead the room karaoke-style. Carnegie Hall mandates masks everywhere but onstage. Marie\\u2019s Crisis Caf\\u00e9, the show-tunes singalong bar in the Village, doesn\\u2019t require masks at all, and neither does the Cutting Room on East 32nd Street.\", \"At a popular late-night Saturday event last month organized by Shake Rattle and Roll, two \\u201cdueling pianists\\u201d at the Cutting Room egged on more than 200 patrons to belt regardless of vocal quality or human dignity. Shake Rattle and Roll, which leads rowdy singalong nights at bars and clubs all over the metropolitan area, said it had missed out on at least $100,000 since the beginning of the pandemic. When Mark Weiser, a pianist and the driving force behind the business, put on his first event in a small Tribeca bar last March after a year\\u2019s hiatus, he was pleasantly surprised.\", \"\\u201cIt was a fully masked crowd, but not fully vaccinated, and we sold 40 tickets and we were overjoyed,\\u201d he said, recalling that the tables were six feet apart and no dancing was allowed. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t know if the audience would be scared or oppositional, but they were people who wanted to sing together so much after a year that they were fantastic, and I was so overwhelmed I became a basket of emotions.\\u201d\", \"At the Cutting Room gig last month, people stood up at their tables, sang and clapped to \\u201cBrown Eyed Girl,\\u201d \\u201cSweet Caroline,\\u201d \\u201cRolling in the Deep\\u201d and \\u201cHey Ya!\\u201d They jumped right in for \\u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You,\\u201d too, even though the holiday season had barely begun.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t go out much, but I love singalongs,\\u201d said Julianna LeBron-Rivera, 25, of Brooklyn, who sat at a table of friends. \\u201cIt reminds me of how my parents always got everyone to sing at parties.\\u201d\", \"Tamara Wesenmael, a 44-year-old from the Upper East Side, spent much of the night standing on a chair with her hands in the air. \\u201cI\\u2019m not a cheesy person,\\u201d she said while taking a break outside the club, \\u201cbut I just love when everyone sings along, especially people you don\\u2019t even know.\\u201d\", \"If caution seemed tossed to the aerosol-laden winds that night, it was quite the opposite at a chorus rehearsal early this month at the Brooklyn High School of the Arts. The Department of Education has strict rules for school music programs, requiring masks even for instrumentalists, who play through slits and have to shield wind instruments with bell covers.\", \"\\u201cStand apart, and social distance from each other,\\u201d Kristy Jung, a vocal teacher, told one of the school\\u2019s five choruses. They did not talk as they settled in and stayed still as she worked their phrasing and tonality.\", \"\\u201cWhat does the music want to do in this section?\\u201d she asked about a song they were preparing for their holiday concert, city regulations willing. Several answered \\u201ccrescendo,\\u201d and they gave her one as she raised her arms to lead them along.\", \"This was the first rehearsal in the school\\u2019s beautifully renovated auditorium for its first holiday concert since 2019. Not that long ago, the Department of Education gave schools the go-ahead for concerts with limited audiences. If the chorus sounded a little muffled and hesitant, it wasn\\u2019t just because of the members\\u2019 masks. They\\u2019d been apart a long time and were still feeling their way back to what singing together means.\", \"Ms. Jung has had challenges rebuilding the choirs she directs to prepandemic levels. For the freshman choir, she even had to use emojis to show them how to form vowels for singing since masks hid everyone\\u2019s faces.\", \"And yet as they worked through \\u201cSing Gently,\\u201d by Eric Whitacre, the patience and forgiveness they showed with one another\\u2019s mistakes and the purity of their young voices came soaring through. \\u201cMay we sing together always,\\u201d they harmonized in rich, bell-like tones. It seemed to be something between a lullaby and a plea.\", \"\\u201cBeing back together, you can hear everything,\\u201d Alicia Acosta, a senior soprano, said after rehearsal. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the unity that\\u2019s so important, because in a choir you rely on other people.\\u201d\", \"Not every choir in the city has found its way back as successfully. Lavender Light, a lesbian and gay gospel choir, lost many members and will not have a holiday concert. Rising Voices Choir, a Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center group, has seen only a third of its members return. Star and Moon Instrumental Choir from Selfhelp\\u2019s Latimer Gardens Senior Center in Flushing, Queens, has only half its members back.\", \"Wen-Li Chen, 73, who leads the group\\u2019s traditional Chinese, Korean and American repertoire, is not pushing reticent members, even though he believes singing together promotes good health. \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t use your body, you can get sick more easily,\\u201d he said. \\u201cMusic is important for a long life, and singing keeps you happy.\\u201d\", \"The resurgence of song has indeed been brightening the season, whether at tree lightings with lusty caroling or the rousing guest performance by the Northwell Health Nurse Choir at a concert Monday at Carnegie Hall.\", \"Then there was the Handel\\u2019s \\u201cMessiah\\u201d singalong at Judson Memorial Church on Washington Square. The four-decades-old tradition, organized by the West Village Chorale, drew ardent amateur singers last Sunday afternoon. Several welled up when they arrived to show their vaccination cards and pick up the score of the renowned oratorio.\", \"\\u201cIt just feels so good to be right next to each other again,\\u201d said Grace Goodman, the chorale\\u2019s oldest member at 85. She had sung all during the pandemic, but these were online performances and Zoom concerts, and she found it disconcerting and even embarrassing to record herself singing alone so that her voice could be edited in with others for digital concerts. \\u201cBut when you sing with a group, you blend and sound great.\\u201d\", \"For the most part that was true of the \\u201cMessiah\\u201d singalong that evening, even if some of it was muffled through masks. The 75 singers (half the size of singalongs prepandemic) filled the church with uplifting four-part harmonies of \\u201cWonderful,\\u201d \\u201cRejoice\\u201d and, of course, \\u201cHallelujah.\\u201d\", \"Near the end, Colin Britt, who said he had gotten goose bumps as he conducted, made an announcement: \\u201cAfter not being able to do this together since 2019, can I get an amen?\\u201d\", \"There were actually 139 amens in the final section of the oratorio that followed. They sang each one with ringing, triumphant voices.\"]","href_hash":"e40ae19a59a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e40ae19a59a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}},
