He said 'no, you don't have to wait eight weeks, you can get it, just book in with one of the pharmacies doing the vaccines'.\", \"\\\"The official booking system only lets you book eight weeks apart, but if you take any child to a place doing the vaccines then they will do it as long as it has been three weeks. And he was right, I booked in with the local pharmacy and the kids had it done there - no-one asked about my decision or gave me any advice that waiting was better.\", \"\\\"The Ministry of Health webpage still makes it sound like it is not possible to shorten the gap between vaccines for children unless they have serious medical conditions. Given the current outbreak, this will mean that by the time their child is fully protected - 10 weeks after the first vaccine has been given - they will have already caught Covid and spread it around the household.\\\"\", \"Last week, Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said experts had looked again at whether a shorter spacing was justified, and decided that it was not.\", \"\\\"Children, because of their much more attuned immune systems, have a much starker response to that first dose, and then also a bigger gap is better for long-term immunity and for reducing the likelihood of some of those rare side effects,\\\" he said.\", \"But the mother said she was happy with her decision, particularly because masks were not always worn by her year 4 daughter's classmates.\", \"\\\"I'm glad that I had my kids fully vaccinated before this outbreak took off. I wish that the government was being more transparent and giving parents the full information to make an informed decision about what is best for their family as this would result in more of my children's classmates being fully vaccinated.\", \"\\\"Transmission at schools will climb now that children will continue to attend even when their classmates go off with Covid - the previous need for the rest of the class to go off as close contacts after one tested positive was a great 'buffer' to prevent widespread transmission across a school. It reflected the reality that children don't social distance in the same way that adults do.\", \"\\\"The government is not being very transparent about this issue and is not communicating clearly with parents. I have spoken to other parents at the school gate and most don't realise there is no rule for an eight-week delay. This lack of information is in effect preventing parents who may wish to get the second vaccine sooner from doing so.\\\"\", \"Ministry of Education figures show 84 percent of schools in Auckland have had cases over the past 10 days and in the past two days there have been a total of 3286 student infections in the city.\", \"Health Ministry figures show 5746 of children under 12 have had a second Covid-19 vaccine dose so far, but it is not known how many of those are because of immunity problems or other health conditions.\", \"The Ministry of Health was approached for comment last week and has not yet responded.\"]","href_hash":"943198569fc711ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"943198569fc711ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
