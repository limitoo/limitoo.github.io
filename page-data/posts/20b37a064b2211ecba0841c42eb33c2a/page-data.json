Steven Cohen says the deal received “universal praise” from his fellow owners.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-21T23:24:42.000Z","content":"[\"There are lots of reasons to be encouraged by the hiring of Billy Eppler, who was finally introduced on Friday as the Mets\\u2019 new general manager. As a pro scouting director, he helped win a World Series for the Yankees. As a general manager, he signed Shohei Ohtani for the Los Angeles Angels. At 46, he is young enough to appreciate the value of data, but old enough to honor the instincts of scouts.\", \"\\u201cI just came back from the M.L.B. owner meetings, and I can tell you: just universal praise for the hiring,\\u201d said the Mets\\u2019 owner, Steven Cohen, who is rebooting the organization again after a trying first season, on and off the field.\", \"\\u201cI mean, people coming up to me from everywhere saying that we got a real pro, well-liked in the industry, well-respected. So I\\u2019m excited. Listen, I put a lot of time into this, and like I always say, I\\u2019ve got a day job. So it\\u2019s a relief to get somebody that I feel really good about.\\u201d\", \"Cohen, a hedge-fund billionaire, made two dud investments last year. He fired the general manager he hired last fall, Jared Porter, after revelations that Porter had sexually harassed a female reporter. The interim general manager, Zack Scott, was fired this month after his late-summer arrest on a charge of driving while intoxicated.\", \"A protracted job search, in which Cohen and the team\\u2019s president, Sandy Alderson, failed to persuade several high-profile candidates, ended with a four-year contract for Eppler, who has a reputation for integrity. What he does not have, however, is a winning record as a general manager.\", \"Even with stars like Mike Trout and Ohtani, the Angels had a losing record in each of Eppler\\u2019s five seasons (2016 through 2020). Asked about it on Friday, Eppler outlined the challenges he inherited: overpaid players on long-term contracts, sharing a division with the well-stocked Houston Astros, an outbreak of pitching injuries, a barren farm system.\", \"\\u201cThe lack of depth made us dip into free agency to fill multiple holes on the roster,\\u201d Eppler explained, \\u201cand when you\\u2019re thin on that depth, any injuries you sustain really make you fall through the ice.\\u201d\", \"Injuries and lack of depth have been familiar problems for the Mets, too, and Cohen conceded on Friday that answers may not come from within.\", \"\\u201cOur budget today, without even signing anybody, is already about $185 million or so,\\u201d Cohen said. \\u201cIf we\\u2019re going to find the right type of talent, it\\u2019s going to, probably, be either trades with other clubs or free agents. We don\\u2019t really have a lot in the farm system to supplement what we need.\", \"\\u201cSo it\\u2019s going to require probably spending, and that\\u2019s what\\u2019s going to happen. And I\\u2019ve let Billy know that I\\u2019m willing, for the right deals and the right free agents, to go and get the players we need.\", \"\\u201cWe want to be competitive, right? We want to win our division and be in the playoffs and get deep into the playoffs, right? So we\\u2019ve got to field a team that has the ability to do that.\\u201d\", \"Of course, Cohen was also willing to spend last off-season, and the Mets got little from their highest-paid newcomers. Shortstop Francisco Lindor, starter Carlos Carrasco and catcher James McCann all performed well below expectations, and Lindor is just now starting his 10-year, $341 million contract.\", \"The rotation is a pressing concern. Noah Syndergaard has already left for the Angels (one year, $21 million) in free agency. Marcus Stroman, the only Mets starter who was healthy and reliable all season, is a free agent. The ace Jacob deGrom missed the second half with arm injuries. Taijuan Walker and Tylor Megill faded in August and September.\", \"\\u201cI look at the roster and definitely want to address the pitching,\\u201d Eppler said, mentioning the departure of Syndergaard. \\u201cWe also are going to entertain things in the outfield and entertain things in the infield.\\u201d\", \"So the Mets need pitching, infield, outfield \\u2014 and a new manager, too. The manager Eppler hired with the Angels, Brad Ausmus, is available; he served one year before the team\\u2019s owner, Arte Moreno, replaced him with Joe Maddon. Eppler offered no hints about his possible choice, but said it would be a collaborative decision.\", \"\\u201cBilly will be reporting to me, but we will certainly consult with one another,\\u201d Alderson said, outlining the Mets\\u2019 chain of command. \\u201cBut I expect Billy to be driving this operation. I will be available as a resource, and as time goes on, what I would expect is that Billy will have even more latitude than he has immediately.\\u201d\", \"The Mets initially sought both a president of baseball operations and a general manager, before limiting the search to one hire. Alderson, who turns 74 next week, said the Mets could still revisit that plan next winter, effectively giving Eppler a year to prove he can run the department.\", \"\\u201cSteve and I will take a look at that at the end of the season and Steve will make a decision about the direction he wants to go,\\u201d Alderson said. \\u201cBut Billy has lots of opportunity here to establish himself and grow and have an impact on that decision a year from now.\\u201d\", \"Eppler worked for the Yankees under George Steinbrenner, so the threat of a Twitter missive from Cohen is unlikely to faze him. Yes, Cohen said, he would continue to tweet because fans seem to like it, but he emphasized the importance of delegating authority.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re going to interfere in every decision, it\\u2019s just not going to work,\\u201d Cohen said. \\u201cAt least, that\\u2019s how I run my other businesses, and that\\u2019s done well. And I expect to run it the same way here.\", \"\\u201cAnd that\\u2019s sort of the plan. You\\u2019re not going to fix everything the first year. I call it a little bit of a treasure hunt: as you go through the organization, you find things that you need to fix. That\\u2019s sort of what I would have expected, coming into an organization that was under-resourced, and we\\u2019re in the process. We made progress last year.\\u201d\", \"That progress was not always clear on the field, as the Mets wheezed down the stretch to finish 77-85. Now Eppler must do what he could not in Anaheim: build a winning team \\u2014 and quickly. Free agents know where to find him.\", \"\\u201cLast night, I was starting to get a lot of texts from agents,\\u201d Eppler said. \\u201cAnd I responded to a lot of them, saying, \\u2018You\\u2019ll hear from me today.\\u2019\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"20b37a064b2211ecba0841c42eb33c2a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"20b37a064b2211ecba0841c42eb33c2a"}},
