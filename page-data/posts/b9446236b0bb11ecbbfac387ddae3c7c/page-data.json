It's almost unrecognisable.\\\"\", \"The enhancements to Neil Street and the domain, the community hub in the centre of Havelock, are almost finished.\", \"The domain will soon have its tennis and netball courts resurfaced and a new skate pump track.\", \"Marlborough District Council projects and contracts manager Maighan Watson said it is the fulfilment of a long-held desire of the Havelock community to see this area improved for the benefit of residents and visitors.\", \"\\\"It's a great example of collaboration across a number of areas of council. Marlborough Roads, parks and open spaces, the small townships programme and assets and services.\", \"\\\"The final parts of this project are coming together now with the pocket park construction and planting of the new garden beds. The project was due to be completed by late 2021 but was impacted by Covid-19 and the 2021 storm event - many contractors had to be relocated elsewhere.\", \"\\\"However, the result is worth the wait. The infrastructure that has gone in will make a big difference to this part of the town which has traditionally had issues with stormwater in significant rain events,\\\" she said.\"]","href_hash":"b9446236b0bb11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b9446236b0bb11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
