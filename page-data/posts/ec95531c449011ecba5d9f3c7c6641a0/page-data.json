Gen. Thomas H. Mancino, released a memo on Thursday that read, in part, \\u201cI hereby order that no Oklahoma Guardsmen be required to take the Covid-19 vaccine, notwithstanding any other federal requirement.\\u201d\", \"The memo also noted that the state would continue to consider applications for vaccine exemptions, though so far federal military authorities have granted very few. It also said, \\u201cno negative administrative or legal action will be taken against Guardsmen who refuse the Covid-19 vaccine.\\u201d\", \"It remained unclear if General Mancino\\u2019s policy would run afoul of the Pentagon\\u2019s vaccine mandate. In August, the secretary of defense, Lloyd J. Austin III, said all active-duty military members must immediately get a Covid-19 vaccine.
