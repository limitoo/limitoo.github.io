Their FIFA world ranking has slipped to its lowest ever point of 26 from a high of 16 in 2015.\", \"Making the knockout rounds for the first time ever from a group containing Norway, the Philippines and Switzerland is the ambition but the omens were not good although Monday night's 2-0 win over Vietnam has boosted morale.\", \"The injection of the likes of CJ Bott and Ria Percival provided more attacking flair although once again the Ferns wasted many goal opportunities, especially in the first half and their opponents provided almost no threat to Ferns goalkeeper Vic Esson throughout the match.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nzhttps://rnz-ressh.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--OqfHHpYj--/ar_16:10,c_fill,f_auto,g_auto,q_auto,w_1050/v1689034147/4L62TLH_Bott_jpg\\\" alt=\\\"CJ Bott of Football Ferns during the international friendly match at McLean Park, Napier , New Zealand on Monday10 July 2023.

She's been in fine form for her US club, Angel City, and is optimistic the national team will deliver for fans. \\\"I hope that we live up to the slogan of 'beyond greatness' by creating a legacy for the Ferns who come after us,\\\" she said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nzhttps://rnz-ressh.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--TIunPIjl--/ar_16:10,c_fill,f_auto,g_auto,q_auto,w_1050/v1688783901/4L6PFKH_coach_jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Coach Jitka Klimkov\\u00e1.\\nNew Zealand Football Ferns training session ahead of the 2023 FIFA Womens World Cup.

So I am happy with our improvement box to box but we need to get better inside of the box,\\\" Klimkova told RNZ in June.\", \"Training sessions were revealing sharpness in front of goal, improved fitness and the ability to change styles to address how their opposition would play, she said.\", \"\\\"The quality of football is growing, we are improving, our fitness is improving. I think our connection on the field, off the field is growing and that's what we wanted.\\\"\", \"This seemed to be borne out by the improvements in their impressive display against Vietnam. It had achieved everything she wanted, she said.\", \"\\\"This was really important for us, this win and this performance,\\\" Klimkov\\u00e1 told Sky Sport.\", \"As for playing at home: \\\"The fans will be our 12th player and that's so important to our team. We will grab this opportunity.\\\"\", \"New Zealand has played 15 matches in all World Cups and won none so reaching the knockout stage may be too tall an order. A win over the 46th ranked Philippines shapes as a realistic target, while draws or narrow losses to Norway (ranked 12) and Switzerland (20) would be encouraging.\", \"Ex-player Maia Jackman (capped 50 times for NZ) believes the tournament has come too soon and the team's peak will coincide with the next World Cup.
