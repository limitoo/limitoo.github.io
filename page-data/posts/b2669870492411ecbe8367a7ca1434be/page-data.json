Her debut novel was a chance to remedy this.\", \"Based on her own life, that book, \\u201cThe Last One,\\u201d follows a young, lesbian Muslim woman in a tough Paris suburb who struggles to reconcile her conflicting identities.\", \"\\u201cI grew up with the idea, whether in films or in books, that I did not exist,\\u201d Daas, 26, said in a recent phone interview. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t exist as a young lesbian, Muslim woman, with an immigrant background,\\u201d she added. \\u201cSo the question I have asked myself a lot is, \\u2018How do we shape ourselves when we have absolutely no representation?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Representation and identity are fraught topics now in France, a country that prides itself on a universalist tradition that unites all citizens under a single French identity \\u2014 regardless of their ethnicity or faith. Identity politics are often seen as a threat to social cohesion.\", \"So Daas\\u2019s book was an unlikely hit when it came out here last year. Critics praised the novel\\u2019s powerful lyricism, and hailed the author for breaking taboos around gender, sexuality and religion. \\u201cThe Last One\\u201d won best debut novel in the 2020 Les Inrockuptibles Literary Prize, organized by the French cultural magazine, and has since been translated into eight languages. It will be released in the United States by Other Press on Nov. 23.\", \"\\u201cFatima Daas\\u201d is a pseudonym, and it is also the name of the novel\\u2019s main character. The author said her book was autofiction, a form of fictionalized autobiography, but how much is true and how much is made up is left for the reader to guess.\", \"Daas declined to give her real name, partly because she didn\\u2019t want to involve her family, she said. But she added that using a pseudonym was in line with her playful exploration of multiple identities: It was about \\u201ccreating and embodying a character, of reinventing myself\\u201d she said.\", \"Each chapter of the novel begins \\u201cMy name is Fatima,\\u201d and is followed by an affirmation, like, \\u201cI am French,\\u201d \\u201cI am Algerian,\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m named after a symbolic figure in Islam.\\u201d\", \"The narrative is punctuated with flashbacks to the main character\\u2019s childhood and adolescence. The youngest of three sisters in a Muslim family from Algeria, and the only one born in France, Fatima struggles to fit in at school and has romantic relationships with women, even though she considers homosexuality a sin. She battles feelings of shame, but refuses to give up any part of herself.\", \"Daas said her novel was more than an affirmation of identity; it was \\u201ca way of saying that it\\u2019s possible, I can be this if I want to. And if I want to say that I am a lesbian and a Muslim, I have the right, the capacity, the freedom to do so,\\u201d she said.\", \"Salima Amari, a sociologist at the Centre for Political and Sociological Research in Paris and author of the book \\u201cLesbians of Immigration,\\u201d said the novel was powerful because it exposed contradictions that many struggled with. \\u201cA woman who defines herself clearly as lesbian and a Muslim, who writes, and therefore who has a voice, exists,\\u201d Amari said. \\u201cThis brings a very rare voice to the French landscape.\\u201d\", \"Daas said she began writing in high school, where she attended workshops by Tanguy Viel, a writer of mystery and detective novels. It took her a while to find other writers she liked, she added, but something clicked when she discovered Annie Ernaux and Marguerite Duras, two French authors whose work Daas quotes throughout \\u201cThe Last One.\\u201d\", \"She wrote the novel in 18 months, as part of a master\\u2019s degree in creative writing at Paris 8 University. There, she met the novelist and filmmaker Virginie Despentes, who had come to talk about her career as part of the course. When Daas told Despentes about the book she was working on, Despentes spurred her on, Daas recalled. \\u201cShe said a lot of people would see themselves in what I was talking about,\\u201d Daas added. \\u201cSo it was very important that I keep writing.\\u201d\", \"Perhaps the most significant taboo Daas addresses in the novel is the issue of internalized homophobia. Throughout, its main character describes herself as \\u201ca sinner\\u201d and feels embarrassed and ashamed of herself.\", \"Two weeks after the book\\u2019s publication, in September, 2020, Daas appeared as a guest on the public radio station France Inter. When asked if, like her character, she believed that being a lesbian made her a sinner, Daas said yes. \\u201cI am searching for complexity,\\u201d she added. A wave of criticism followed on social media, in which L.G.B.T. people accused Daas of encouraging homophobia.\", \"In the interview, Daas said she wanted to explain her internal conflicts, but she was not interested in acting as the spokeswoman for any group. The question by the France Inter interviewer was \\u201ca way to move the conversation away from my work and instead talk about the subject of Islam,\\u201d she added: \\u201cThere has been this obsession with Islam and homosexuality, because they are hot topics.\\u201d\", \"Fa\\u00efza Gu\\u00e8ne, a writer who shot to fame in France at 19 with her first novel \\u201cKiffe kiffe demain\\u201d (\\u201cMore of the Same Tomorrow\\u201d), said in an interview that \\u201ca lot of people would have preferred it if Fatima Daas had written a book about giving up Islam because she is a lesbian.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIf you want to be French today, a fully French citizen, you have to give up one of the fragments of your identity,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut we are full of paradoxes.\\u201d\", \"While \\u201cThe Last One\\u201d doesn\\u2019t offer solutions to the problem of conflicting identities, Daas said she hoped readers from different backgrounds would relate to the experience of struggling to find one\\u2019s place in society.\", \"\\u201cGrowing up like that wasn\\u2019t easy,\\u201d she said. Though writing had helped her say things she never thought she would say, she added, publishing a hit novel had not eased her feelings of shame.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think literature can save people, but it can be liberating,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what this book has given me.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b2669870492411ecbe8367a7ca1434be"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b2669870492411ecbe8367a7ca1434be"}},
