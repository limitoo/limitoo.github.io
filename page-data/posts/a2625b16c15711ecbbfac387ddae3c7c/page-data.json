Putin hailed that as a \\\"success.\\\"\", \"But leaving the plant in Ukrainian hands robs the Russians of the ability to declare complete victory in Mariupol, which has seen some of the most dramatic fighting of the war and whose capture has both strategic and symbolic importance. The scale of suffering there has made it a worldwide focal point, and its definitive fall would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, and free up Russian troops to move elsewhere in the Donbas.\\u00a0Shoigu said the plant was \\\"securely blocked.\\\"\\u00a0Putin and Shoigu's comments appeared to reflect a change in strategy in Mariupol, of which the Russians previously seemed determined to take every last inch. But it was not clear what it would mean in practical terms.\\u00a0Ukrainian officials did not comment on the latest remarks, but earlier said four buses with civilians managed to escape from the city after several unsuccessful attempts. Thousands more remain the city, much of which has been reduced to a smoking ruin in a nearly two-month siege, with over 20,000 people feared dead.\\u00a0Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said another attempt to evacuate civilians from Mariupol would be made Thursday, though it was not clear how the latest comments would affect that.\", \"In Kyiv, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\\u00e1nchez and Denmark's Mette Frederiksen became the latest European leaders to show support with a visit to the capital. They were due to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who warned in a video address overnight that the Russians were not \\\"abandoning their attempts to score at least some victory by launching a new, large-scale offensive.\\\"\\u00a0\\\"The West stands together to support the Ukrainian people,\\\" Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said in a statement.\\u00a0Meanwhile, the Kremlin said it submitted a draft of its demands for ending the war, and the West raced to supply Ukraine with heavier weapons to counter the Russians' new drive to seize the industrial east.\\u00a0Britain's Defense Ministry said in an assessment that Russia likely desires to demonstrate significant successes ahead of its annual May 9 Victory Day celebrations. \\\"This could affect how quickly and forcefully they attempt to conduct operations in the run-up to this date,\\\" he said.\\u00a0As fears grew for the fate of civilians in Mariupol, the Kyiv regional police said Thursday that two mass graves with nine bodies were discovered in the city of Borodyanka, northwest of the capital. The findings added to thousands of civilians reported killed by Russian forces, who have been accused of wholesale abuses of Ukrainians.\\u00a0The head of the Kyiv regional police, Andriy Nebytov, said two women and a teenager were among the \\\"civilians killed by the Russian occupiers.\\\"\\u00a0\\\"I want to stress that these people are civilians. The Russian military deliberately shot civilians that didn't put up any resistance and didn't pose any threat,\\\" Nebytov said, adding that some of the victims were apparently tortured.\\u00a0With global tensions running high, Russia reported the first successful test launch of a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, the Sarmat. Putin boasted that it can overcome any missile defense system and make those who threaten Russia \\\"think twice.\\\" The head of the Russian state aerospace agency called the launch out of northern Russia \\\"a present to NATO.\\\"\\u00a0The Pentagon described the test as \\\"routine\\\" and said it wasn't considered a threat.\\u00a0On the battlefield, Ukraine said Moscow continued to mount assaults across the east, probing for weak points in Ukrainian defensive lines. Russia said it launched hundreds of missile and air attacks on targets that included concentrations of troops and vehicles.\\u00a0The Kremlin's stated goal is the capture of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern region that is home to coal mines, metal plants and heavy-equipment factories. Detaching it from the rest of Ukraine would give Putin a badly needed victory two months into the war, after the botched attempt to storm the capital, Kyiv.\\u00a0The U.K. Defense Ministry said Russian forces were advancing from staging areas in the Donbas toward Kramatorsk, which continues to suffer from persistent rocket attacks.\\u00a0The Luhansk governor said Russian forces control 80% of his region, which is one of two that make up the Donbas. Before Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the Kyiv government controlled 60% of the Luhansk region.\\u00a0Gov. Serhiy Haidai said the Russians, after seizing the small city of Kreminna, are now threatening the cities of Rubizhne and Popasna. He urged all residents to evacuate immediately.\\u00a0\\\"The occupiers control only parts of these cities, unable to break through to the centers,\\\" Haidai said on the messaging app Telegram.\\u00a0Analysts have said the offensive in the east could become a war of attrition as Russia faces Ukraine's most experienced, battle-hardened troops, who have fought pro-Moscow separatists in the Donbas for eight years.\\u00a0Russia said it presented Ukraine with a draft document outlining its demands for ending the conflict - days after Putin said the talks were at a \\\"dead end.\\\"\\u00a0Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that \\\"the ball is in their court, we're waiting for a response.\\\" He gave no details on the draft, and it was not clear when it was sent or whether it offered anything new to the Ukrainians, who presented their own demands last month.\\u00a0Zelenskyy said he had not seen or heard of the proposal, though one of his top advisers said the Ukrainian side was reviewing it.\\u00a0Moscow has long demanded Ukraine drop any bid to join NATO. Ukraine has said it would agree to that in return for security guarantees from other countries. Other sources of tension include the status of both the Crimean Peninsula, seized by Moscow in 2014, and eastern Ukraine, where the separatists have declared independent republics recognized by Russia.\\u00a0Earlier this week, Ukraine said the Russians dropped heavy bombs to flatten what was left of the Azovstal steel plant .\\u00a0A few thousand Ukrainian troops, by the Russians' estimate, remained in the plant and its labyrinth of tunnels and bunkers spread out across about 4 square miles. Zelenskyy said about 1,000 civilians were also trapped.\\u00a0A Ukrainian apparently in the plant posted a Facebook video urging world leaders to help evacuate people from the plant, saying, \\\"We have more than 500 wounded soldiers and hundreds of civilians with us, including women and children.\\\"\\u00a0The officer identified himself as Serhiy Volynskyy of the 36th Marine Brigade and warned: \\\"This may be our last appeal. We may have only a few days or hours left.\\\" The authenticity of the video could not be independently verified.\\u00a0Russia has repeatedly issued ultimatums to the defenders to surrender, but the Ukrainians have ignored them.\\u00a0More than 100,000 people overall were believed trapped in Mariupol with little if any food, water, medicine or heat. The city's pre-war population was 400,000.\\u00a0A Zelenskyy adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter that he and other Ukrainian negotiators were ready to hold talks without conditions to save the lives of trapped Mariupol defenders and civilians. There was no immediate response from Russia.\\u00a0Elsewhere, some residents of the eastern city of Kharkiv have lived in basements for weeks, trying to stay safe from Russian shelling. With no running water, gas or electricity, they collect rainwater and cook on open fires, burning debris from destroyed wooden buildings.\\u00a0In one neighborhood, they sought safety in a school basement - using desks, tables and chairs to fashion beds. More than 300 people slept there during the first days of the war, but most have left for safer places, and only a few dozen remain.\\u00a0As Russia funneled troops and equipment into the Donbas, Western nations rushed to boost the flow of military supplies to Kyiv for this new phase of the war - likely to involve trench warfare, long-range artillery attacks and tank battles across relatively open terrain.\", \"President Joe Biden \\u00a0was set to announce plans Thursday to send more military aid to Ukraine, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\\u00a0Zelenskyy said Ukraine's Western allies have \\\"come to understand our needs better,\\\" adding that Ukraine is receiving new shipments of Western weapons \\\"now, when Russia is trying to step up its attacks, not in weeks or in a month.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"a2625b16c15711ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a2625b16c15711ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
