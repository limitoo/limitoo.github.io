When he arrived home from the festival, he started feeling unwell and has since tested positive for the virus.\", \"\\\"I got tested on Tuesday, earlier on in the day when I felt a bit under the weather, so I decided to get tested to be safe. Then when I got back from the test, I went and had a sleep and woke up just feeling not good, just terrible. I had like a 40-degree temperature. I just didn't even want to be alive.\\\"\", \"With the amount of physical contact that took place, he feared the virus could have spread widely among festivalgoers.\", \"\\\"Well, I mean it's a festival. What goes around comes around. Everyone is there just sharing water, sharing goons, just everything, sharing vapes and what not, bloody hooking up, you know, it's a festival, what can you expect? It's going to go around.\\\"\", \"He went with a group of friends, four of whom have now tested positive.\", \"\\\"Everyone is getting tested and it's just slowly adding up and there's a lot of other people awaiting results, and some have tested negative but are going back to see.\\\"\", \"Maia Wylie, who is also fully vaccinated, was with her friends at SoundSplash.\", \"After returning home, she and a number of her friends started feeling unwell with flu-like symptoms.\", \"\\\"Myself and my friends got tested as soon as we came home from the event. We found out we were all negative, which gave us a bit of peace of mind, but after seeing all the comment sections, it did make us question if those tests were accurate to us, since we still have symptoms. We'd rather be safe than be sorry going back to school in a couple of days.\\\"\", \"She said a lot of people at the festival were coughing, but they just attributed it to the dust from the dry ground at Mystery Creek.\", \"\\\"There were people sharing drinks and food.
