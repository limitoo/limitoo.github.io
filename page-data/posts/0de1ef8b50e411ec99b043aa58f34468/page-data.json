regulator from performing all types of cosmetic surgery and ordered to remove his social media posts.\\u00a0\", \"The Australian Health Practitioner Agency (AHPRA) has imposed a range of conditions on Dr Daniel Aronov, who was the most-followed cosmetic surgeon on social media with more than 13 million TikTok followers until suddenly deleting his account a fortnight ago.\", \"It comes a month after a joint investigation by Four Corners and Nine Newspapers\\u00a0uncovered allegations of troubling practices across Dr Lanzer's clinics, including serious hygiene and safety breaches and procedures by Dr Lanzer that\\u00a0left patients in extreme pain and requiring further medical treatment.\", \"Dr Aronov's registration conditions follow an announcement by AHPRA that Dr Lanzer gave a legally enforceable undertaking to stop practising medicine in Australia\\u00a0while it continued its investigation into him and his network of clinics.\", \"<img

Channel Seven TV show.(Source: The Cosmetic Surgery Show/Seven Network)</div>\", \"Under the conditions, Dr Aronov is prevented from doing cosmetic or surgical procedures, including minor surgery.\", \"But they do allow him to continue to work as a GP if supervised by an AHPRA-approved supervisor.\", \"It says, \\\"the practitioner must not practise unless supervised and even when supervised, the practitioner must only practise as a General Practitioner.\\\"\", \"It says he can't resume work\\u00a0as a GP until a nominated supervisor has been approved by AHPRA.\", \"\\\"The practitioner must consult and follow the directions of the supervisor about the management of each patient before care is delivered and must be directly observed by the supervisor who is physically present at the site of practice at all times,\\\" one of the conditions says.\", \"A spokesperson for AHPRA said there was no time limit on the conditions and they would remain until they were revoked by the Medical Board of Australia.\\u00a0AHPRA has not completed its investigation into Dr Aronov.\", \"\\\"Usually this would only happen if the Board believes the restrictions are no longer necessary, on appeal by an independent tribunal.\\\"\", \"Other conditions relate to social media and include the removal of published material or information relating to cosmetic or surgical procedures on his social media accounts.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/378a5af58cf1e22b47da49f159feb7eb\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Cosmetic surgeon Dr Daniel Aronov.(TikTok:\\u00a0@dr.danielaronov)</div>\", \"Consumer research advocates Michael Fraser and Maddison Johnstone spent more than a year monitoring 100 cosmetic surgery Instagram accounts and found that Dr Lanzer and Dr Aronov were the most active.\", \"They said the latest move by AHPRA to clamp down on social media is unprecedented and should put other doctors on notice about the responsible use of these platforms.\", \"Dr Lanzer's clinics stopped taking new patients within days of the revelations of the joint media investigation, then quietly reopened for business.\", \"In Sydney, one of those patients, a 42-year-old woman, was found by her partner in a critical condition on November 16 and was rushed to St Vincent's Hospital hours after undergoing a tummy tuck and liposuction procedure by Dr Aronov at the Surry Hills Day Hospital.\", \"David Faktor, a spokesman for St Vincent's Hospital, said the hospital was \\\"very concerned about key aspects of the patient's care provided by the cosmetic clinic.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/158129bd8b82e9b5b3ff4ae10cb9425f\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> A woman who recently underwent liposuction from Dr Aronov was taken to hospital in a critical condition with significant blood loss.</div>\", \"He said the hospital would report its concerns to the appropriate governing authorities.\", \"The patient's procedures, including a tummy tuck and liposuction, cost her $30,000.\", \"Her treatment in the public hospital over 11 days cost the hospital at least $50,000.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/25fa8bd8de76c17528e602cac9d33c3a\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Watch the Four Corners investigation into the unregulated world of cosmetic surgery.</div>\", \"Plastic surgeon Professor Mark Ashton, who was shown the patient's vitals on arrival, said it was a miracle she was alive.\", \"In a previous statement, Dr Aronov described the\\u00a0incident as \\\"serious\\\".\", \"\\\"While all patients are warned of the risks of significant complications multiple times, this does not detract from the distress experienced by this patient and her family,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"As soon as I was made aware of the patient's deterioration, without hesitation I recommended an ambulance be called immediately, and then personally attended to assess the situation and assist the paramedics. I have been liaising with her treating team throughout her recovery.\\\"\", \"Dr Aronov is a GP, who, like many others in his field, moved into the lucrative field of cosmetic surgery.\", \"Under Australian regulations, cosmetic surgeons do not require specialist training, unlike plastic surgeons.\", \"Since the stories broke in late September, more than 100 patients have come forward with harrowing stories of their experiences at Dr Lanzer's clinics.\", \"The latest medical emergency at St Vincent's Hospital comes two weeks after the joint investigation revealed Dr Aronov had filmed a mock re-enactment of a separate medical emergency involving another patient, Suzanne Steward.\", \"Ms Steward was rushed to hospital with punctured lungs following a liposuction procedure earlier this year in Dr Lanzer's Melbourne clinic.\", \"Dr Aronov said he had no involvement in her liposuction procedure and that the mock video was a \\\"self-mocking\\\" video \\\"aimed at boosting staff morale.\\\"\", \"Dr Lanzer tried to stop the stories by taking urgent action in the Federal Court, but was not successful.\"]","href_hash":"0de1ef8b50e411ec99b043aa58f34468"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0de1ef8b50e411ec99b043aa58f34468"}},
