I'm really proud of the efforts on the ground.\\\"\", \"Pasifika GP Network chair Api Talemaitoga agrees and says the community and providers have put in the hard effort to boost vaccination rates.\", \"\\\"The message has been to reach out to a neighbour or maybe a family friend. It's easy to talk about getting vaccination with people like us who might have a car or could take an hour out to go and get vaccinated but what if you're a 24/7 carer looking after someone with an inability to get out and access one of those vaccinations.\\\"\", \"Collins says the challenge now is getting to the last few people and making sure people who got their first dose are getting their second dose.\", \"\\\"The door knocking campaign has been where it's essential.\\\"\", \"He says its good to keep in mind the Pacific population is a much younger population.\", \"\\\"There's research now that suggests that incentivisation should have been used earlier because that's what is attracting some people to the vaccination process.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/129054/eight_col_0Z9A4866.jpg?1629937071\\\" alt=\\\"A testing station at the Samoan Assembly of God Church in South Auckland's M\\u0101ngere.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nA testing station at the Samoan Assembly of God Church in South Auckland's M\\u0101ngere. \\nPhoto: RNZ / Marika Khabazi\\n</div>\", \"Experts estimate that Covid-19 pushed thousands more children into poverty, and public health leaders are sounding the alarm of a \\\"silent epidemic\\\" of mental illness among those at the centre of the outbreak in South Auckland.\", \"Talemaitoga says providers on the ground in South Auckland have stepped up to give families the support they need, when someone has Covid but also when there is anxiety and mental illness.\", \"\\\"What I'm a bit worried about is we may get to see a bit of the illness get into violence as well in families.
