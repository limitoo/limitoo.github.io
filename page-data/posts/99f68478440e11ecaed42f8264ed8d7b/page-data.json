He was asked to leave and he refused, leading to his being dragged from the train and charged with violating the Louisiana Separate Car Act. He pleaded guilty and was fined $25.\", \"On Friday, nearly 130 years after the arrest, the Louisiana Board of Pardons voted to clear his record.\", \"\\u201cThere is no doubt that he was guilty of that act on that date,\\u201d Jason Williams, the Orleans Parish district attorney, told the board during a brief hearing on Friday. \\u201cBut there is equally no doubt that such an act should have never been a crime in this country.\\u201d\", \"The arrest elevated Plessy into the central figure in a legal battle that reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The landmark ruling that resulted in the case, Plessy v. Ferguson, came to be regarded as one of most shameful decisions in the court\\u2019s history as well as one of the most consequential. It endorsed the \\u201cseparate but equal\\u201d doctrine and gave legal backing to the Jim Crow laws that segregated and disenfranchised African Americans in the South for decades.\", \"Officials said that the effort to pardon Plessy, who died in 1925, was a way to acknowledge a vicious history with a stubborn legacy that the nation continues to grapple with. \\u201cThere are small things that we can do every day to atone for the sins of the past that we had nothing to do with,\\u201d Mr. Williams said.\", \"The board\\u2019s decision was sent to Gov. John Bel Edwards, who will decide whether to grant the posthumous pardon. A spokeswoman for Mr. Edwards said on Friday that he was traveling but \\u201clooks forward to receiving and reviewing the recommendation of the board upon his return.\\u201d\", \"In making their decision, board officials cited the Avery C. Alexander Act, legislation named for the civil rights leader and longtime member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, which calls for pardoning individuals who had been convicted of violating laws enacted with the purpose of enforcing segregation or discrimination.\", \"The 1890 Louisiana Separate Car Act was precisely that kind of law, part of a flurry of segregationist legislation pursued across the South in an effort to construct a new racist order after Reconstruction.\", \"\\u201cIt almost makes you think it was designed for just this moment, for Homer Plessy,\\u201d Mr. Williams said of the Alexander Act.\", \"Plessy had boarded the East Louisiana Railway\\u2019s No. 8 train in New Orleans intending to get arrested. He was an activist who was part of a local civil rights group that was infuriated by the Separate Car Act. The group chose Plessy as the one to ride the train because he could pass for a white man.\", \"A conductor asked Plessy if he was \\u201ccolored,\\u201d and he said that he was. When the conductor instructed him to move to a different car, Plessy resisted. After his arrest, the activist group, the Citizens\\u2019 Committee to Test the Constitutionality of the Separate Car Act, posted his $500 bond.\", \"His first court appearance came four months later before Judge John Howard Ferguson, who decided not to bring the case to trial, which allowed Plessy\\u2019s lawyers to bring an appeal to higher courts. The case continued on for several years before it reached the Supreme Court in 1896. The court ruled against Plessy, 7-1.\", \"The lone dissenter, Justice John Marshall Harlan, wrote: \\u201cIn respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man and takes no account of his surroundings or his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved.\\u201d\", \"The notion of separate but equal was maintained until the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954. In the meantime, Plessy returned to Judge Ferguson\\u2019s courtroom, where he entered his guilty plea and was fined.\", \"Although Plessy\\u2019s activism preceded the nonviolent disobedience of the civil rights movement, his legacy was mostly attached to a ruling that was condemned as a blemish for the court and the country.\", \"In recent years, descendants of both sides of the case joined together to create a foundation, bonding over their shared history and working to educate others on its relevance now. Plessy v. Ferguson, as the descendants like to say, had become Plessy and Ferguson.\", \"\\u201cWe cannot undo the wrongs of the past, but we can and should acknowledge them and learn from them,\\u201d said Phoebe Ferguson, a descendant of Judge Ferguson.\", \"During the hearing on Friday, Keith M. Plessy described himself as a \\u201cfirst cousin three generations removed.\\u201d A pardon was a way of acknowledging his ancestor\\u2019s role in shaping the civil rights movement that followed.\", \"\\u201cI once met Rosa Parks, and as I kneeled before her and thanked her for all her hard work, she said to me, \\u2018Get up, boy! Your name is Plessy. You got work to do,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Plessy recalled. \\u201cI\\u2019ll admit I didn\\u2019t know what she meant then, but I\\u2019m sure now, and I\\u2019m convinced that she was talking about the work we\\u2019re doing today.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"99f68478440e11ecaed42f8264ed8d7b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"99f68478440e11ecaed42f8264ed8d7b"}},
