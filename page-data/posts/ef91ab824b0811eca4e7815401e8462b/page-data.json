Brennan pressed Cruz on these claims Sunday morning.\", \"\\\"Didn't indulging the doubters damage our democracy and our standing in the world?\\\" she asked.\", \"Cruz said he has not read the book but denied having conversations with Trump on January 6. Brennan continued pressing him on the issue, and he acknowledged he \\\"had many conversations with him in days and weeks and months leading up to January 6.\\\"\", \"He also defended his challenge of the election results, saying he needed to investigate the unproven allegations of widespread voter fraud.\", \"\\\"My point is simple. Under the Constitution, Congress has a role. It has a responsibility when it comes to certifying votes,\\\" he said, later adding that there is \\\"historical precedence\\\" to do so.\", \"Brennan pointed that the \\\"intellectualized argument\\\" he used on the show was not what rioters \\\"chanting things like '[hang] Mike Pence' were talking about.\\\"\", \"Cruz argued that because there is a \\\"substantial chunk of our country that has real doubts about the integrity of the election,\\\" a credible electoral commission for an audit would have \\\"enhanced faith in democracy.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937271/ted-cruz-challenged-cbs-election-january-6.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Face the Nation host Margaret Brennen pressed GOP Texas Senator Ted Cruz, above, on his challenging of the 2020 election results Sunday morning.</div>\", \"In the election's aftermath, audits in several swing states including Arizona and Michigan have upheld Biden's victory. The GOP-backed audit of Arizona's Maricopa County found that Biden won by a larger margin than the original count. However, even following these audits, Trump and his allies have continued falsely claiming he won in these states.\", \"Meanwhile, Cruz has faced backlash for his involvement in challenging the election results. Billboards posted in Texas earlier this year urged him to resign. Other Republicans, including Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, have also criticized him. This month Cheney accused him of \\\"posturing for the secessionist vote.\\\"\", \"Cruz was one of the eight U.S. senators who voted to overturn Biden's win on January 6. That same day, a group of Trump supporters rioted at the U.S. Capitol during a protest against the electoral college certification.\", \"Trump and his allies have continued making claims that the election was stolen through massive voter fraud, though no substantial evidence has been presented to prove these claims.\"]","href_hash":"ef91ab824b0811eca4e7815401e8462b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ef91ab824b0811eca4e7815401e8462b"}},
