A U.S. airstrike killed all of them.\", \"The following month, a strike in East Mosul killed four civilians and sent shrapnel into the spinal cord of a boy named Hassan Aleiwi Muhammad Sultan, partially paralyzing him.\", \"The next year in Mosul, Kareema Khalid Suleiman and 33 members of her family gathered in what they hoped was a safe place during fighting between the U.S. and ISIS. An airstrike killed everybody in the house but Suleiman, who climbed out from the rubble.\", \"Airstrikes \\u2014 from drones or piloted planes \\u2014 have been the central military tactic that the United States has used in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and other recent conflicts. And U.S. officials often trumpet their advantages. Airstrikes have allowed the U.S. to kill terrorists and other enemies with minimal civilian casualties and without putting American troops in danger, the officials claim.\", \"These arguments have some truth to them. Airstrikes helped the U.S. defeat ISIS in several places, including the Mosul area. But it has also become clear that American officials have exaggerated the benefits of airstrikes and substantially underplayed their downsides, starting with the horror of civilian casualties.\", \"This weekend, The Times published an investigation \\u2014 written by Azmat Khan, a contributing writer at The Times Magazine \\u2014 of the systemic failures with the military\\u2019s use of airstrikes. The magazine has now published a second article by Azmat, focusing on the human toll of those failures in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.\", \"\\u201cIf it weren\\u2019t for her clothes, I wouldn\\u2019t have even known it was her,\\u201d Ali Younes Mohammed Sultan told Azmat, describing his daughter, who was one of the 21 members of the Zeidan family killed during their dinner. \\u201cShe was just pieces of meat. I recognized her only because she was wearing the purple dress that I bought for her a few days before. It\\u2019s indescribable.\\u201d\", \"Azmat\\u2019s work is an astonishing feat of reporting, as her editor, Luke Mitchell, told me. She spent much of the past five years obtaining military documents and traveling through Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan to interview witnesses and visit 60 different bomb sites.\", \"Wars inevitably involve death, including civilian death, as advocates of air warfare \\u2014 across the Biden, Trump, Obama and George W. Bush administrations \\u2014 often point out. These officials argue that the civilian toll from airstrikes is still less than the toll wrought by tanks rumbling through neighborhoods or by airplanes carpet-bombing cities.\", \"Yet Azmat\\u2019s reporting has exposed serious problems with the American use of airstrikes:\", \"A rush to confirm targets, ignoring evidence that they may involve significant civilian casualties \\u2014 or may not even be military targets.\", \"Before the attack that killed the Zeidan family, one U.S. official warned that children and their families most likely lived near the target; she was ignored. As Azmat writes, \\u201cConfirmation bias ran rampant.\\u201d\", \"An undercounting of civilian deaths. In some cases, the toll was nearly double that acknowledged by the military. Military documents claim that 27 percent of airstrikes with civilian casualties include children among the toll; The Times\\u2019s reporting suggests it is 62 percent.\", \"Lack of apologies or compensation after mistakes. One example: The U.S. never contacted the survivors of the attack that partially paralyzed the boy in East Mosul, and his family struggles to afford his wheelchair.\", \"Lack of accountability for mistakes. The military frequently absolves its members of wrongdoing. Last week, the Pentagon said that no troops would be punished for an August drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed 10 civilians, including seven children.\", \"Ultimately, Azmat argues that the U.S. approach to airstrikes is so flawed that it may undermine American security \\u2014 at mortal cost to others \\u2014 rather than protect it. She writes:\", \"Here are the main takeaways from the first part of The Times investigation, and here is Azmat\\u2019s magazine story focused on the human cost of airstrikes.\", \"Bret Stephens and Gail Collins look ahead to 2022.\", \"Students and parents desperately need schools to get back to normal, says Michelle Goldberg.\", \"Mouthwatering: The 25 essential dishes to eat in New York City.\", \"Buying influence: How China manipulates Facebook and Twitter.\", \"Pop star: Britney Spears felt trapped.

Twenty-one months later, the sports world is again the face of an outbreak, this time as Omicron spreads.\", \"N.B.A. officials postponed five games after dozens of players either tested positive or had close contact with someone who had. To help fill their depleted roster, the Brooklyn Nets reinstated Kyrie Irving, who has missed the entire season because he is not vaccinated. He went into Covid protocols before playing a game.\", \"Omicron is affecting other sports, too. The N.F.L. rescheduled three games this weekend to account for outbreaks. The Premier League in England called off most of its games this weekend. And the N.H.L. is postponing 21 games between today and Dec. 23.\", \"For more: In The Times, Kurt Streeter argued that pro sports should take a vacation until at least February.\", \"Have malted cream, hazelnut praline and chocolate?
