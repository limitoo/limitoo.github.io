The move goes beyond strictly financial matters, however, also curbing \\\"diplomatic and technical assistance\\\" tied to carbon-emitting projects.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949459/cop26-summit-day-three.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Halting federal funding toward overseas carbon projects follows U.S. President Joe Biden's pledge to make America a climate leader.
