My family wasn\\u2019t enough, I guess, so I recently started feeding the birds as well: all kinds of seeds for all kinds of birds, in different devices, on complicated hooks designed to foil the squirrels and trash pandas. And it\\u2019s been a joy to meet my noisy new customers, visible to me from the kitchen while I cook: sly and elegant blue jays and marauding blackbirds, red-capped woodpeckers, fat little titmice, the occasional cardinal with her calls of cheer, cheer, cheer. I like the idea of word getting out on bird social media, the original Twitter: Good grub at Sifton\\u2019s. See you there?\", \"Which means Sunday dinner is a little more complicated these days. There\\u2019s the filling of the feeders to start, and then prep for a family meal, which if I\\u2019m lucky we can eat early with the soundtrack of birdsong. This week\\u2019s offerings include sunflower seeds for the avian crowd, and a lot of pomegranate ones for the humans, in the form of Naz Deravian\\u2019s recipes for the Persian winter solstice holiday of Shab-e Yalda: a pomegranate and chicken stew called khoresh morgh nardooni (above) and kaale seerabeh salad, an uncooked pomegranate-walnut sauce turned into a dressing for vegetables and fruit. The actual solstice isn\\u2019t until the 21st, of course. But as they say down South, I\\u2019ll tell you what: I\\u2019m in need of light and longer days now.\", \"A farro and broccoli bowl with lemony tahini for Monday night? Maybe, though I love the taste of these Indian butter chickpeas.\", \"On Tuesday night, I like this midnight pasta with roasted garlic, olive oil and chile, fast and elegant and delicious, at least once you\\u2019ve roasted the garlic. (Roast a few heads instead of the one the recipe calls for. What\\u2019s left over will keep in an airtight container for a couple of weeks in the fridge and is terrific in salad dressings, on pizzas, in all sorts of pastas.)\", \"Cook\\u2019s choice on Wednesday night: You could make either this hearty sheet-pan mushroom parmigiana situation or my freestyle roasted chicken Parm, which is hardly a recipe at all.\", \"For Thursday, how about wine-braised chicken with artichoke hearts? Canned artichoke hearts are a weeknight cooking secret weapon!\", \"And then on Friday, you can run out the week with a luscious Dijon and Cognac beef stew or, if you\\u2019re pressed for time, with spicy slow-roasted salmon with cucumbers and feta.\", \"Thousands and thousands more recipes await you on New York Times Cooking. You do, yes, need a subscription to access them. We think it\\u2019s worth the investment: not just for the recipes, but for the tools and features that make cooking them easier, including the subscriber notes that follow each one. If you haven\\u2019t taken one out already, I hope that you will subscribe today. (We\\u2019re offering gift subscriptions as well.)\", \"And we\\u2019ll be standing by in case anything goes wrong along the way. Write us at cookingcare@nytimes.com and someone will get back to you. (You can also reach out to me, if you\\u2019d like to say hello or lodge a complaint. I\\u2019m at foodeditor@nytimes.com. I read every letter sent.)\", \"Now, it has precious little to do with scrambling eggs or deep-frying borek, but take a few moments to review Smithsonian Magazine\\u2019s 10 winners of the Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards for 2021.\", \"Here\\u2019s a fascinating look at an indigenous potato that may be a key to our future, by James Dinneen for The Counter.\", \"Do take time to read this watch news, even if you rely on your phone for the time. Watch news is fascinating: fashion writ small.\", \"Finally, The New Pornographers played Webster Hall in New York last week as part of their 21st anniversary celebration of their debut album, \\u201cMass Romantic.\\u201d No good video from that (yet!), but here\\u2019s the band\\u2019s \\u201cLetter From an Occupant,\\u201d live from Matador Record\\u2019s 21st birthday in Las Vegas back in 2010.
