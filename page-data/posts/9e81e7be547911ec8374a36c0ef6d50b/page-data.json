The 25-year-old speech pathology graduate student was declared missing at the end of August 2021, with his body being recovered in September from the Illinois River near the city of Peru. While the LaSalle County coroner claimed that there was no evidence of an altercation on Jelani's body, his mother said that she believes her son was murdered in a hate crime.\", \"\\\"I know I'm not the first mother who has lost a child, but when you lose a child and don't know why,\\\" Bolden Day said at a press conference on Friday, \\\"I don't know how you cannot stop insisting that the people who have made pledges to protect and serve find the answers for you. I know that they are not magicians, but my son went missing.\\\"\", \"According to The Chicago Sun-Times, she cited her own investigations into her son's death, such as finding that his car was abandoned 60 miles from his university, as evidence that he was murdered. She is asking for more authorities to come in and investigate the case.\", \"\\\"I need the FBI to come in and to take over because these local jurisdictions have shown us that they have not made this a priority, they have not made Jelani a priority,\\\" Day said.\", \"Crump and the Reverend Jesse Jackson stood beside Bolden Day during the press conference. The lawyer has become a notable figure in recent years after representing the families of George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, and Michael Brown along with several others.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945337/ben-crump.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Civil rights attorney Ben Crump was hired by Carmen Bolden Day, the mother of Jelani Day, to help investigate the Illinois State University student's death.
