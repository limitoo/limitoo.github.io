Rory Angelotta, 43, was reported missing after friends told police he failed to show up for a Christmas dinner with friends, CBS Sacramento reports.\\u00a0\", \"Angelotta was skiing at the Northstar California ski resort, which was experiencing extreme weather at the time of his disappearance. Police said the missing skier scanned his pass on the ski lift around 11:30 a.m. on Saturday morning, but no activity was recorded after that. His car was found in the resort parking lot and his phone was also turned off.\\u00a0\", \"Angelotta was described as an \\\"experienced skier\\\" who was believed to have avalanche gear on him when he went missing, according to the Placer County Sheriff's office. He had moved from Colorado to Truckee, California, in October and worked as the general manager of the Surefoot ski shop in Northstar, according to officials.\\u00a0  \", \"After he was reported missing, emergency services including Tahoe Nordic Search and Rescue, Nevada County Search and Rescue and Northstar Ski Patrol were deployed to aid in the search. Rescue personnel \\\"were on skis, snowmobiles and a snowcat during their search\\\" but faced \\\"high avalanche danger, strong winds, whiteout flurries, frigid temperatures and heavy snow loads\\\" that caused them to call off the search Sunday night, the sheriff's office said.\", \"MISSING PERSON\\u203c\\ufe0f43-year-old Rory Angelotta of Truckee was reported missing on 12/25 when he didn\\u2019t make it to Christmas dinner after his ski trip at @Northstar_CA. #PCSO and other agencies continue to search for him.
