He was 96.\", \"His granddaughter Asia Johnson confirmed the death but did not specify a cause.\", \"When Detroit\\u2019s storied New Bethel Baptist Church, a hub for the civil rights movement, was forced out of its home in the early \\u201960s to make way for a freeway, and had to move its congregation for a time to a theater, its leadership turned to Mr. Johnson to design a new church. (Such sweeping urban renewal efforts razed many Black neighborhoods, and were called \\u201cNegro removal\\u201d by many Black Detroiters.)\", \"Mr. Johnson\\u2019s massive concrete and glass structure, with a spire that evoked the motor city\\u2019s factory roots \\u2014 or the Empire State Building \\u2014 cost half a million dollars in 1963. When it opened in March of that year, 2,000 members marched from the theater to the new church; its pastor, Clarence LaVaughn Franklin, otherwise known as C.L., told The Detroit Free Press that it was like a trip \\u201cfrom the valley to the mountain.\\u201d\", \"And when the reverend\\u2019s daughter, Aretha Franklin, once New Bethel Baptist\\u2019s star choir soloist, died in 2018, thousands lined up for a viewing of her body there. It was the \\u201cQueen of Soul\\u2019s\\u201d second stop before her funeral at the Greater Grace Temple, also in Detroit.\", \"By 1963, Mr. Johnson had already designed a number of striking Black churches in Detroit: boldly modern structures with floating glass ceilings and jutting peaked roofs like the prows of ships, all on tight urban sites. His work was a sign of progress and mobility for members of the Black community, who had till then often worshiped in meat markets and grocery stores. (New Bethel Baptist had once been in a former bowling alley.)\", \"When the congregation of Bethel A.M.E., which included the record executive Berry Gordy and his family, needed new digs for its swelling membership, they also turned to Mr. Johnson for what would be the church\\u2019s fourth or fifth home since 1841. When it opened in 1974, the church Mr. Johnson designed was a low, circular building with a center peak topped with a metal spire \\u2014 it recalls both African structures, and a spaceship.\", \"\\u201cIn Detroit we say there\\u2019s a church on every corner,\\u201d Ken Coleman, a journalist who writes often about African American life in Detroit, said in an interview, \\u201cbut Johnson created some of the more iconic ones.\\u201d\", \"The Second Baptist Church of Detroit, the city\\u2019s oldest Black church, which in an earlier incarnation had been a stop on the Underground Railroad, was another venerable congregation that reached out to Mr. Johnson. They needed to expand their brick Gothic Revival building to add an education center.\", \"It was a culturally significant contract: In 1839, Second Baptist had opened the first school for Black children in Detroit.\", \"Mr. Johnson\\u2019s Brutalist addition, built in 1968, spoke to his aesthetic taste at the time, but it was also a slight concession to the bank that lent the church the money to expand. In an all too typical exchange, Mr. Coleman said, the bank directed Mr. Johnson to build something that didn\\u2019t look too ecclesiastical, as the lenders were convinced the church wouldn\\u2019t be able to pay its debt and the bank would have to foreclose and resell the structure.\", \"Mr. Johnson would go on to design 30 or 40 churches, said Saundra Little, a Detroit architect who with Karen Burton, an architectural designer, is the founder of Noir Design Parti, an organization that is compiling histories of Detroit\\u2019s Black architects, including Mr. Johnson.\", \"His churches, Ms. Little added, were just a fraction of his body of work, which included public housing, single-family residential work and residential towers, campuses and dorms for churches and schools, and the city\\u2019s People Mover stations, an elevated transit system built in the 1980s.\", \"His oeuvre also, notably, includes Stanley\\u2019s Mannia Cafe, a \\u201970s era Chinese restaurant and hot spot favored by Motown stars and Coleman Young, the city\\u2019s first Black mayor (the building had an after life in the \\u201990s as a house and rap music nightclub). With flying concrete buttresses and a peaked entry that soars like a church spire, the building is a Detroit example of what\\u2019s known as Googie architecture. The style, which began in Los Angeles, and is named for the architect John Lautner\\u2019s design for Googies coffee shop there, features flourishes reminiscent of the futuristic cartoon \\u201cThe Jetsons,\\u201d along with exaggerated lines.\", \"\\u201cJohnson was always pushing the envelope structurally and stylistically,\\u201d Ms. Little said in an interview. \\u201cHe liked to test the limits.\\u201d\", \"Nathan Johnson was born on April 9, 1925, in Herington, Kan., at the time a town of just over 4,000. He was the youngest of four children of Ida and Brooks Johnson, who worked for the railroad as a boiler washer and boilermaker helper.\", \"Nathan had a talent for art, and in the eighth grade a teacher pushed him toward architecture. \\u201cArchitects are appreciated while they\\u2019re living and artists are appreciated when they\\u2019re dead,\\u201d he recalled her saying.\", \"In 1950, after earning a bachelor\\u2019s degree in architecture from Kansas State University, he took a job in Detroit working as a draftsman for Donald White and Francis Griffin, for a long period the only Black architectural firm in the city. He later worked for Victor Gruen, the Austrian \\u00e9migr\\u00e9 whose firm designed scores of shopping malls across the country, before opening his own firm in 1956, working mostly in his community on what he called \\u201cthe small stuff.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe ran into the Midwest version of Jim Crow,\\u201d Jamon Jordan, Detroit\\u2019s official historian, said in an interview. \\u201cBlacks can vote and earn a good wage, but if a white firm or a wealthy white client is asking for an architect, what they don\\u2019t want to see is a Black designer.\\u201d\", \"It wasn\\u2019t until the waning days of the civil rights movement, when a rising Black middle class gained political control in the late \\u201960s and beyond \\u2014 Mr. Young took office in 1974 \\u2014 that Mr. Johnson began to win large commercial and government contracts in his city.\", \"Debra Davis, an architect who worked for Mr. Johnson\\u2019s firm in the late \\u201980s, described an affable and generous boss who dressed in crisply tailored gray double-breasted suits and drove a \\u201cfleet of gray luxury cars.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cJohnson is the quintessential Detroit success story,\\u201d Mr. Coleman said, \\u201cwho happens to be African American.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Johnson married Ruth Gardenhire in 1952; she died in 2005. In addition to his granddaughter, Asia, Mr. Johnson is survived by his partner, Yvonne Shell; a daughter, Joy Johnson; a son, Shahied Abdullah Shabazz Muhajid; three stepchildren, Debbie Shell, Mark Bellinger and Odis Bellinger; four more grandchildren; and three stepgrandchildren.\", \"When The Detroit Free Press wrote a profile of Mr. Johnson in 1963, he declared his commitment to modernism and his extreme distaste for ornamentation and pastiche \\u2014 \\u201cdishonest copies of the past,\\u201d as he put it.\", \"He particularly disliked colonial architecture. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not living a colonial life, we\\u2019re not using colonial materials and we don\\u2019t even believe in colonialism,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhy should we design a colonial church?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI compare a building to an organism, such as the human body,\\u201d he added. \\u201cIt\\u2019s beautiful because it works.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"eb54c4444bd211ec83296d2986973fbb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eb54c4444bd211ec83296d2986973fbb"}},
