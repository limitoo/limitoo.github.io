The agency has scaled back leases in Wyoming and Montana due to potential impacts on vulnerable animal populations. Despite this, Wyoming still has roughly 280 square miles up for leasing.\", \"However, the BLM said that there is not much they can do to prevent climate change impacts from burning the fuels.\", \"\\\"BLM has limited decision authority to meaningfully or measurably prevent the cumulative climate change impacts that would result from global emissions,\\\" the agency said in a statement.\", \"The Interior Department cited in its report that the social cost of these leases is projected to range from $357 million to around $4 billion. These costs have caused ire to those questioning why the administration is moving forward with the leases. Harvard University economics professor James Stock is questioning the validity of the agency's belief that they cannot stop the leases.\", \"\\\"To say it's too hard, they can't do that \\u2014 that's simply not true,\\\" says Stock. \\\"All of those calculations have been done. This is very surprising to me and inconsistent with the Biden administration's climate goals.\\\"\", \"The leases are expected to begin early next year.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1924646/natural-gas-flare.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A flare burns natural gas at an oil well on Aug. 26, 2021, in Watford City, N.D.
