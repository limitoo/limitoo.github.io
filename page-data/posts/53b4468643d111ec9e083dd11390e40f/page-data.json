We were going to have to stay inside, maybe for a long while.\\u201d\", \"That\\u2019s a quote from the author-illustrator Dan Yaccarino\\u2019s \\u201cThe Longest Storm.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know for sure whether this plain-spoken but boldly graphic picture book was intended to resonate with recent history \\u2014 picture books can take years to produce \\u2014 but resonate it does. Yaccarino\\u2019s storm lasts for days, maybe even a week or more. Ha, any contemporary reader may well scoff, that\\u2019s nothing when it comes to being cooped up. But until paging through \\u201cThe Longest Storm\\u201d and two other new picture books that may or may not have been inspired by life during Covid-time, I hadn\\u2019t quite realized what an infantilizing experience lockdown had been, especially in its earliest days, when so many of us were reluctant or unable to venture outdoors at all. Like toddlers, we not only had limited autonomy, but we were also living in a world where inside-outside was once again a primal divide. If you\\u2019re looking for silver linings, the pandemic at least encouraged us not to take the quotidian for granted.\", \"This, of course, is fertile picture book territory: the fresh eyes on absolutely everything that Margaret Wise Brown called \\u201cthe first great wonder at the world.\\u201d There are plenty of recent picture books meant to explain the pandemic to children, to soothe them in the manner of stories about dead pets or grandparents. There is even a picture book biography of Anthony Fauci that might make a fine baby gift with which to needle your Fox News-addicted cousin. But \\u201cThe Longest Storm\\u201d digs into the experience of lockdown \\u2014 the sheer endurance required and the psychic toll. The story ends with the opening of a door onto an outside world that is both exhilarating and humbling. So too, with a little less feeling and a lot more overt wit, does Brendan Wenzel\\u2019s \\u201cInside Cat,\\u201d another visually sophisticated tale steeped in confinement. But once past the threshold \\u2026 then what? That\\u2019s a question for David Soman\\u2019s sumptuously illustrated \\u201cThe Impossible Mountain,\\u201d a parable about conquering fear and venturing out into the world. Which also strikes a chord, no? As might the word \\u201cimpossible\\u201d itself.\", \"Yaccarino\\u2019s book is centered on a family headed by a single father \\u2014 photos glimpsed in the opening spread imply he\\u2019s a widower \\u2014 with a preteen daughter and two younger twins. The story is about the grind of being housebound: the aggravation, the fraying nerves and emotions. \\u201cBeing home together like that, all the time, felt strange. But soon it went from strange to bad, to worse. And just when it felt like it couldn\\u2019t get any worse \\u2026 It did. We were completely sick of each other.\\u201d\", \"That terse, tense It did accompanies a picture of unshaven dad blowing his stack \\u2014 arms raised, mouth in mid-growl \\u2014 bathed in a Munch-worthy mustard yellow that we will see thrice more: in a terrifying flash of lightning that serves as the book\\u2019s pivot point; in reassuring candlelight when the power goes off; and, with its hue gently muted, as beckoning sunlight when the storm lifts. Anger, terror, comfort and release all wrung from yellow. Yaccarino\\u2019s flat but expressionist colors do more work than a casual glance might reveal.\", \"This is a deceptively simple story with real emotional and visual depth, concluding with an acknowledgment that happy endings often leave work yet to be done. That, too, hits home, or have you forgotten the brief, Arab Spring-like optimism of last June?\", \"Wenzel is a master of perspective. His \\u201cThey All Saw a Cat\\u201d (a Caldecott honoree) depicted the same animal as seen by a kid, a dog, a mouse and so on. \\u201cA Stone Sat Still\\u201d pulled off something similar yet more profound for a mere rock, ending on an elegiac note of loss and memory. \\u201cInside Cat\\u201d is also about point of view, but just one \\u2014 the title character\\u2019s. Wenzel\\u2019s rhyming text begins: \\u201cInside Cat knows many windows, finds a view wherever it goes. Wanders. Wonders. Gazes. Gapes. Sees the world through many shapes.\\u201d Inside Cat is lucky that it lives not in a small Upper West Side apartment (like some cats I know) but in a vast home with many, many windows of many, many dimensions across many, many floors. That\\u2019s a lot of looking, as promised by the huge eyes dominating the book\\u2019s cover. The humor lies in Inside Cat\\u2019s partial-view assumptions. Is that firefighter really climbing a ladder to the clouds? Are we positive there\\u2019s a dinosaur on the unseen end of that teeter-totter?\", \"As someone once said, there are known unknowns and unknown unknowns, but tell that to this overconfident pet. \\u201cInside Cat might know it ALL!\\u201d the story concludes. \\u201cEvery view and every floor. All the windows, world, and more. Top to bottom. Head to toe. Nothing more for you to \\u2026 Oh.\\u201d With that diminutive last word Inside Cat strides out the front door into a vast, jumbled, visually cacophonous cityscape \\u2014 a page turn to rival the cut to color that accompanied Judy Garland\\u2019s first steps in Oz. Again, I don\\u2019t know if Wenzel\\u2019s book was conceived during the pandemic \\u2014 like Yaccarino\\u2019s and Soman\\u2019s books, it will surely outlast the present tense \\u2014 but its jokes and rueful wisdom land a little harder in 2021 than they would have in, say, 2019.\", \"If \\u201cThe Longest Storm\\u201d and \\u201cInside Cat\\u201d end with tentative steps beyond too-familiar borders, that\\u2019s the starting point for \\u201cThe Impossible Mountain,\\u201d which takes place in what you might call a fairy tale-adjacent neighborhood \\u2014 a vaguely Northern European village circled by a high stone wall. The effect is a bit like living at the bottom of a nuclear power plant\\u2019s cooling tower. Our heroine, Anna, and her little brother, Finn, \\u201chad always been told that the Wall kept them safe from a scary, unknown world.\\u201d (Soman\\u2019s tale resonates with more than one contemporary headline.) But Anna\\u2019s eyes and spirit crave more. One day she and Finn climb the Wall and see a high, beautiful mountain in the distance. A few pages later, they\\u2019re off to scale it, a trek in which they\\u2019re aided by a mountain goat and the Great and Terrible Bear they\\u2019ve been warned about, who turns out to be a paternal soft touch. And what do they find when they finally reach the peak? More mountains, \\u201call of them waiting to be climbed.\\u201d Another happy ending with more challenges ahead.\", \"Soman\\u2019s gorgeous, painterly illustrations \\u2014 watercolors mixed with gouache and pencil \\u2014 play gracefully with scale, doing justice to both mighty landscape and small, intrepid siblings. Bonus credit for inducing what I believe is the second twinge of vertigo I\\u2019ve ever experienced reading a picture book (the first being Mordicai Gerstein\\u2019s \\u201cThe Man Who Walked Between the Towers,\\u201d about the aerialist Philippe Petit and the original World Trade Center). Honestly, after a year and a half stuck indoors to varying degrees, a little vertigo is a tonic.\"]","href_hash":"53b4468643d111ec9e083dd11390e40f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"53b4468643d111ec9e083dd11390e40f"}},
