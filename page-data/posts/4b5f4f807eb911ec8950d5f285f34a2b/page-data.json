Apps turn people into play things. The pandemic is fatal for vibes. Adele reigns atop the Billboard charts, singing her tales of longing and woe.\", \"Is romance dead? Not in the frothy world of podcasts, where two recent audio dating shows \\u2014 \\u201cThis Is Dating\\u201d and \\u201cIt\\u2019s Nice to Hear You\\u201d \\u2014 aim to reinvent matchmaking in a time of isolation.\", \"\\u201cThis Is Dating,\\u201d from the independent studio Magnificent Noise, follows four daters looking to break out of old patterns and start meaningful relationships. In exchange for their participation (the show uses real voices but fake names), the subjects get a team of fairy godmothers tasked with rehabilitating their love lives.\", \"A dating coach, Logan Ury \\u2014 the director of relationship science at the dating app Hinge and author of \\u201cHow to Not Die Alone: The Surprising Science That Will Help You Find Love\\u201d \\u2014 helps each dater identify his or her bad habits. Producers do the matchmaking, recruiting a stable of potential partners based on the dater\\u2019s preferences. Listeners hear one actual date per episode, conducted over Zoom because of Covid, and the producers and Ury help there, too. Sitting in as (mostly) silent participants, they drop occasional icebreakers into the chat to keep up momentum.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s an incredible exercise in trust,\\u201d said Jesse Baker, a co-founder of Magnificent Noise and co-creator of \\u201cThis is Dating,\\u201d which premiered earlier this month and is produced by Baker, Hiwote Getaneh and Eleanor Kagan. \\u201cYou talk to us about the problems you feel you\\u2019re having, and we offer this one kind of whack-a-doodle way to approach things differently.\\u201d\", \"Baker, an executive producer of the popular couples therapy podcast \\u201cWhere Should We Begin? With Esther Perel,\\u201d which she helped create, brought some of that show\\u2019s analytical sensibility to her new podcast. The show balances MTV game-show-style elements \\u2014 separately recorded sideline commentary is intercut with audio from the dates \\u2014 with the more earnest ambitions of modern social psychology.\", \"Over the course of the season, listeners will follow the daters as they go on multiple first dates, each one presented as a step on the road to self-discovery.\", \"\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t just want a voyeuristic half-hour in someone\\u2019s awkward blind date,\\u201d Baker said. \\u201cIt was important to us to show growth.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s Nice to Hear You\\u201d also applies narrative framing to the dating game. The show, which ended a six-episode first season last spring (a second is in development), follows three couples who are allowed to correspond once a day for 30 days. In a twist, the couples use pseudonyms and can only communicate via voice memo, with no photos or other identifying information exchanged. At the end of the experiment, each finds out whether their connection is more than one-dimensional.\", \"Part of the appeal of \\u201cIt\\u2019s Nice to Hear You\\u201d is its implication that appearance and other physical concerns are superfluous to romance. The show\\u2019s creator and publisher, Heather Li, developed it after watching the Netflix dating series \\u201cLove Is Blind,\\u201d in which contestants, who get to know their prospective partners over the span of one week, agree to get married without ever seeing them.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s Nice to Hear You\\u201d avoids such lofty stakes, but it\\u2019s remarkable to hear just how intimate the couples become within its constrictive framework. Two weeks into the project, one woman declares that she has already shared more with her match than she had in any previous real-world relationship. \\u201cI feel like I\\u2019ve known him for years,\\u201d she says.\", \"Li, a retail consultant who created the podcast while in a dating slump of her own, said the restraints helped some participants get out of their own way. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not being distracted by what someone looks like or what\\u2019s in their background,\\u201d Li said. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s harder to prejudge someone if you don\\u2019t have as many data points.\\u201d\", \"On both \\u201cThis Is Dating\\u201d and \\u201cIt\\u2019s Nice to Hear You,\\u201d the limitations of the medium are turned into strengths. The inability of the listener to see the shows\\u2019 daters makes it easier to project oneself into his or her shoes. And the relatively unobtrusive nature of the production apparatus \\u2014 a smartphone recorder in the case of \\u201cIt\\u2019s Nice to Hear You\\u201d and a Zoom account for \\u201cThis Is Dating\\u201d \\u2014 all but eliminates the \\u201cI\\u2019m not here to make friends\\u201d observer effect stoked by the presence of reality television crews.\", \"Among the biggest challenges were finding enough participants to make plausible matches \\u2014 both shows said they had far more women apply than men \\u2014 and ensuring that interactions on the dates were entertaining to listen to. On \\u201cThis Is Dating,\\u201d the virtual daters make cocktails, play improv games and give each other bedroom tours, among other mood-enhancing activities.\", \"\\u201cNone of us are professional matchmakers, but creating an environment where people could have fun and feel a connection felt like something we could totally do,\\u201d said Getaneh, one of the producers of \\u201cThis Is Dating.\\u201d\", \"One question both shows faced was how to deliver satisfying resolutions. Here, Li got lucky. Shortly before she began \\u201cIt\\u2019s Nice to Hear You,\\u201d she had been ghosted by a guy she had been seeing casually. Li decided to include her personal journey as a multi-episode story line, confessing her struggles with intimacy and communication to the same relationship coach who had interviewed her subjects.\", \"When she eventually meets her current boyfriend, whom she has now been with for more than a year, her happy ending becomes the podcast\\u2019s.\", \"\\u201cListening to so many hours of other people communicating so openly helped me realize that I needed to be bolder and more assertive,\\u201d Li said. \\u201cIf they were doing it, why couldn\\u2019t I?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4b5f4f807eb911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4b5f4f807eb911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
