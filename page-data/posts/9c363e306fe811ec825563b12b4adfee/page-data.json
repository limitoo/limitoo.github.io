When I close my eyes I see his execution in my mind, over and over, and I'll see that for the rest of my life,\\\" he said. \\\"The man who killed my son has sat in this courtroom every single day next to his father. I'll never get that chance, to sit next to my son, ever again.\\\"\", \"Jasmine Arbery then spoke in a quavering voice with poetic descriptions of her brother's Blackness, which she said was mistaken for criminality by his murderers: \\\"He had dark skin that glistened in the sunlight like gold,\\\" she said. \\\"He had curly hair; he would often like to twist it. He had a broad nose and the color of his eyes was filled with melanin.\\\"\", \"Lawyers for all three men have said they will appeal the convictions. All three men also face a federal trial in February on hate-crime charges, accused in an indictment of violating Arbery's civil rights by attacking him because of his \\\"race and color.\\\"\", \"Arbery, a 25-year-old avid jogger, was running through the mostly white residential neighborhood of Satilla Shores on the afternoon of Feb. 23 when the McMichaels decided to grab their guns, jump in a pickup truck and give chase. The younger McMichael would later testify to the jury they had a hunch Arbery might be fleeing a crime.\", \"Bryan joined the chase in his own pickup truck after it passed his driveway, and pulled out his cellphone to record Travis McMichael firing a shotgun at Arbery at close range. Arbery had nothing on him besides his running clothes and sneakers.\", \"\\\"They chose to target my son because they didn't want him in their community,\\\" Wanda Cooper-Jones, Arbery's mother, told the court. \\\"When they couldn't sufficiently scare him or intimidate him, they killed him.\\\"\", \"Bryan's video caused outrage when it emerged months later and it became clear that none of the men involved had yet been arrested after a local prosecutor concluded the killing was justified.\"]","href_hash":"9c363e306fe811ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9c363e306fe811ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
