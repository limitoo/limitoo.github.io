The Los Angeles Rams added the Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller to an already tremendous defense, but the long-rumored Miami Dolphins trade for Deshaun Watson did not come to pass, and Odell Beckham Jr. is still (at least nominally) a member of the Cleveland Browns.\", \"This week\\u2019s injured/Covid-list designations have had a greater effect on betting lines than the league\\u2019s trades: The Tennessee Titans will try to remain relevant without Derrick Henry, and Aaron Rodgers\\u2019s positive coronavirus test has tremendously swung the odds of Kansas City beating his Green Bay Packers.\", \"Below is a look at N.F.L. Week 9, with all picks made against the spread.\", \"Last week\\u2019s record: 4-11\", \"Byes: Buccaneers, Seahawks, Lions, Washington\", \"Jets at Indianapolis Colts, 8:20 p.m., Fox and NFL Network\", \"Line: Colts -10.5 | Total: 46.5\", \"The backup quarterback Mike White had an unexpectedly proficient outing \\u2014 405 yards, three touchdowns and an 82 percent completion rate \\u2014 in his first N.F.L. start, giving the Jets (2-5) some optimism that they can weather Zach Wilson\\u2019s knee injury.\", \"Wilson will again sit against the Colts (3-5), leaving White to try to repeat his performance against a respectable passing defense that allows 243 yards per game. The Colts are the better team, but Carson Wentz has been unsure \\u2014 he threw two interceptions against the Titans last week \\u2014 leaving room for the Jets to keep this one close. Pick: Jets +10.5\", \"Tennessee Titans at Los Angeles Rams, 8:20 p.m., NBC\", \"Line: Rams -7.5 | Total: 53.5\", \"Derrick Henry\\u2019s foot surgery is expected to keep him out at least six weeks, a devastating absence for the Titans (6-2), who have fed their workhouse running back a league-high 237 touches. His replacement, the veteran Adrian Peterson, 36, probably won\\u2019t find success against the Rams (7-1), who just added Von Miller to an already formidable defensive front. Throwing against Los Angeles won\\u2019t be any easier, with the Titans\\u2019 Ryan Tannehill having to account for Jalen Ramsey in the secondary.\", \"Tennessee can still be a playoff team if the receivers A.J. Brown and Julio Jones get healthy, (the status of Jones\\u2019s hamstring injury makes him questionable to play), but this is not a game that will help the Titans\\u2019 case. Pick: Rams -7.5\", \"Cleveland Browns at Cincinnati Bengals, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Bengals -3 | Total: 46.5\", \"This is essentially a must-win for the Browns (4-4), who are in last place in the A.F.C. North and face a pretty insurmountable standings battle if they lose again to divisional opponent. They declined to trade Odell Beckham Jr., and the organization\\u2019s stalemate with the unhappy receiver puts into question his availability for Sunday.\", \"The Bengals (5-3), though, will be eager to show that their upset loss to the Jets was a fluke. After rushing for a mere 41 yards last week \\u2014 its lowest total this season \\u2014 Cincinnati will find a particular challenge against the Browns\\u2019 sixth-ranked rushing defense. Cleveland pass rusher Myles Garrett, the league\\u2019s sack leader (10.5), will be motivated to add Joe Burrow to his quarterback graveyard, and the Browns\\u2019 sense of urgency about moving out of last place should compel them to at least keep the score tight. Pick: Browns +3\", \"Green Bay Packers at Kansas City, 4:25 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Kansas City -7.5 | Total: 54.5\", \"Kansas City (4-4) is not a good team at the moment. The defense has been atrocious, allowing the fourth-most passing yards (2,158) and the eighth-most rushing yards (974) in the N.F.L., and Patrick Mahomes has thrown a league-high 10 interceptions while trying to compensate for the team\\u2019s other mistakes.\", \"But Kansas City, playing at home, went from +2.5 underdogs to -7.5 favorites with the news that Aaron Rodgers would miss this game after testing positive for the coronavirus. Still, the Packers (7-1) should have receivers Davante Adams and Allen Lazard back, and even with tight end Robert Tonyan out with a knee injury, the backup quarterback Jordan Love should have more than enough targets to cut through a meager defense in his first N.F.L. start. Pick: Packers +7.5\", \"Arizona Cardinals at San Francisco 49ers, 4:25 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: 49ers -1 | Total: 45\", \"What a difference a week makes. The Cardinals (7-1) were undefeated through seven games, but a loss to the Packers last week and injuries to cornerstone players forced oddsmakers to downgrade Arizona to an underdog for this matchup. Quarterback Kyler Murray (ankle) and center Rodney Hudson (rib) are questionable, while defensive end J.J. Watt (shoulder) is done for the year.\", \"Even if Colt McCoy has to step in for Murray, the Cardinals have enough offensive firepower to handle the 49ers (3-4), especially if Arizona\\u2019s defense makes quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo struggle. Pick: Cardinals +1\", \"Houston Texans at Miami Dolphins, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Dolphins -7 | Total: 45.5\", \"The trade deadline passed, and Tua Tagovailoa is still the starting quarterback of the Miami Dolphins (1-7). At least until March.\", \"That\\u2019s the earliest an official swap with the Texans (1-7) for Deshaun Watson could be processed, if by then Watson has resolved the 22 accusations of sexual misconduct against him. The actual football contest between these two teams will be overshadowed by that saga, with a win not proving much for either.\", \"Miami played the Bills competitively last week, and the Texans traded their best running back, Mark Ingram, angering their top receiver, Brandin Cooks. The discord should be too much for Houston to surmount, even if Tyrod Taylor is able to start for the first time since Week 2. Expect the Dolphins to end a seven-game losing streak. Pick: Dolphins -7\", \"Denver Broncos at Dallas Cowboys, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Cowboys -8.5 | Total: 49.5\", \"The Cowboys (6-1) showed last week they could win without Dak Prescott, and he might take a day off against the Broncos (4-4), too. Denver traded linebacker Von Miller to the Rams this week in a white-flag move for the teetering franchise. Though Dallas cornerback Trevon Diggs and left tackle Tyron Smith are both questionable with ankle injuries, the Cowboys should cover the spread easily. Pick: Cowboys -8.5\", \"Atlanta Falcons at New Orleans Saints, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Saints -6 | Total: 43\", \"Jameis Winston tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, and he will miss the remainder of the season for the Saints (5-2). If Taysom Hill is still in the concussion protocol, the journeyman Trevor Siemian will start at quarterback against the Falcons (3-4). While Coach Sean Payton and the offense adapt to yet another quarterback change, the Saints will lean on their defense, which has allowed the league\\u2019s second-lowest points total (128).\", \"They will be able to focus on containing Atlanta\\u2019s rookie tight end, Kyle Pitts, since the Falcons will be without receiver Calvin Ridley, who stepped away from the team to attend to his mental health. Pick: Saints -6\", \"New England Patriots at Carolina Panthers, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Patriots -3.5 | Total: 41\", \"The Patriots (4-4) are riding a two-game win streak on the strength of an offense that\\u2019s found a rhythm, and a schedule that\\u2019s hit a weak stretch. Damien Harris has rushed for 100 yards in two of the last three games and has scored a touchdown in four consecutive weeks. Hunter Henry, one of two tight ends the Patriots signed in free agency this off-season, has scored a touchdown in four of the last five games, and the rookie quarterback Mac Jones has looked more comfortable under center.\", \"The Panthers (4-4), may be without Sam Darnold, who was concussed in last week\\u2019s loss. It\\u2019s unlikely that his backup, P.J. Walker, will find much success against a Bill Belichick defense. Pick: Patriots -3.5\", \"Buffalo Bills at Jacksonville Jaguars, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Bills -14.5 | Total: 49\", \"The spread, while lopsided, is about right. The Bills (5-2) are one of the best teams in the N.F.L. while the Jaguars (1-6) are one of the worst. Josh Allen and the Buffalo offense should have their way with a Jacksonville defense that has allowed the fifth-most passing yards per game (278.1). Trevor Lawrence and the Jaguars\\u2019 offense will struggle against the Bills\\u2019 top-ranked defense (1,883 yards allowed). Bet on Buffalo with confidence. Pick: Bills -14.5\", \"Las Vegas Raiders at Giants, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Raiders -2.5 | Total: 46.5\", \"The Raiders (5-2) are talented enough offensively to score frequently against the Giants (2-6), while Daniel Jones could again be without his top targets, who were forced out of last week\\u2019s loss to Kansas City by injuries \\u2014 Sterling Shepard (quad), Kadarius Toney (thumb) and Dante Pettis (shoulder). It\\u2019s also unknown if Kenny Golladay (knee) will return from a three-game absence.\", \"Las Vegas should cover the spread relatively smoothly, even without receiver Henry Ruggs III, whom the team released Tuesday because of his role in a fatal car crash. Pick: Raiders -2.5\", \"Minnesota Vikings at Baltimore Ravens, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Ravens -5.5 | Total: 49.5\", \"Don\\u2019t expect The Vikings (3-4) to contain the Ravens (5-2) after they could not even beat Dallas\\u2019s backup quarterback last week. Lamar Jackson is not Cooper Rush, and Jackson should salivate over competing against Minnesota\\u2019s defense, which allowed Rush to throw for 325 yards. Baltimore receiver Sammy Watkins (hamstring) and running back Latavius Murray (ankle) could return from their injuries after the team\\u2019s bye. Pick: Ravens -5.5\", \"Los Angeles Chargers at Philadelphia Eagles, 4:05 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Chargers -1.5 | Total: 50\", \"Fans of the Chargers (4-3) should start to be concerned. The defense has allowed the second-most rushing yards this season (1,116), a flaw that has been on display in back-to-back losses. The Eagles (3-5) had their best rushing game of the season against the Lions last week, running for 236 yards without the starting back Miles Sanders (ankle), who was placed on injured reserve.\", \"Chargers Coach Brandon Staley is considered one of the best defensive minds in the league, but expect opponents to exploit his team on the ground until he adjusts. The underdog Eagles could ride Boston Scott and Jordan Howard to an upset. Pick: Eagles +1.5\", \"Chicago Bears at Pittsburgh Steelers, 8:15 p.m., ESPN\", \"Line: Steelers -6.5 | Total: 40\", \"Justin Fields\\u2019s highlight touchdown scramble last Sunday happened because the Bears\\u2019 offensive line, which has allowed the most sacks in the N.F.L. (30), again broke down and forced the rookie quarterback to escape the pocket.\", \"The Bears (3-5) drafted Fields 11th overall this year in part because of his ability to make unscripted plays, but Chicago\\u2019s faulty pass protection leaves him without other options. The Steelers (4-3) traded the pass rusher Melvin Ingram to Kansas City this week, and even without him, Pittsburgh should rattle the young passer and cover the spread. Pick: Steelers -6.5\", \"A quick primer for those who are not familiar with betting lines: Favorites are listed next to a negative number that represents how many points they must win by to cover the spread. Raiders -5.5, for example, means that Las Vegas must beat Chicago by at least 6 points for its backers to win their bet. Gamblers can also bet on the total score, or whether the teams\\u2019 combined score in the game is over or under a preselected number of points.\"]","href_hash":"b1ae48743d2611ecbf1d000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b1ae48743d2611ecbf1d000017025a03"}},
