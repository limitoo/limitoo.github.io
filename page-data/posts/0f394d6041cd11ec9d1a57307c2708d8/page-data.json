Chris Sununu against Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, as one of their best shots to upend the Senateâ€™s 50-50 split.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-10T02:23:55.000Z","content":"[\"Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, a Republican, surprised his party on Tuesday by announcing that he would not run for U.S. Senate next year, rejecting a full-court press from national Republicans who tried to recruit him to compete for a Democratic-held seat that the G.O.P. believed could determine control of the Senate.\", \"Instead, Mr. Sununu announced that he would seek a fourth two-year term as governor, a job in which he said he could make more of a difference than in Congress, where \\u201ctoo often doing nothing is considered a win.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMy responsibility is not to the gridlock and politics of Washington,\\u201d he said at a news conference. \\u201cIt is to the citizens of New Hampshire.\\u201d\", \"Republican leaders had seen a Sununu challenge to Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, as one of their best shots to upend the Senate\\u2019s 50-50 partisan split, which gives Democrats control with the tiebreaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris.\", \"At a Republican gathering in Las Vegas over the weekend, where Mr. Sununu spoke, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas urged attendees to lean on Mr. Sununu. \\u201cEvery person here needs to come up to Chris and say, \\u2018Governor is great, but you need to run for Senate,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \\u201cBecause this man could single-handedly retire Chuck Schumer as majority leader of the Senate.\\u201d\", \"Republicans in Washington were taken off guard by Mr. Sununu\\u2019s decision. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, who had personally lobbied Mr. Sununu to run, was given no heads up about his decision, according to Josh Holmes, an adviser to Mr. McConnell. The Republican Governors Association \\u201chad no idea either,\\u201d Mr. Holmes said.\", \"But a longtime Republican consultant in New Hampshire, Dave Carney, said the decision by Mr. Sununu, a scion to the state\\u2019s leading Republican family, was hardly a surprise to those who know him. \\u201cThe gridlock in D.C. is a hard sell,\\u201d Mr. Carney said.\", \"The decision was perhaps most surprising given that the political climate ahead of the midterms has shifted in Republicans\\u2019 favor after their gains in races across the country last week. Although the 2022 Senate map favors Democrats, with their most vulnerable incumbents running in states that President Biden won, his narrow victories in places like Arizona and Georgia make first-term Democrats there potentially vulnerable. Democrats\\u2019 best shot at picking up a Senate seat is in Pennsylvania, the only Republican-held seat that is now open in a Biden-won state.\", \"In New Hampshire, the most serious Republican candidate to declare a Senate run so far is Donald C. Bolduc, a retired Army general. He lost a G.O.P. primary last year to a Trump-endorsed challenger, who ultimately lost against New Hampshire\\u2019s senior senator, Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat.\", \"Republicans consider Ms. Hassan, who won her seat by about 1,000 votes in 2016, to be among the most vulnerable Democratic senators next year.\", \"\\u201cMaggie dodged a bullet for sure,\\u201d said Irene Lin, a Democratic consultant who has worked in New Hampshire.\", \"Mr. Sununu, 47, is a younger brother of a former U.S. senator, John E. Sununu, and a son of John H. Sununu, a former governor and a top White House aide to President George H.W. Bush.\", \"Recent polls of New Hampshire showed that in a hypothetical matchup, Mr. Sununu\\u2019s lead over Ms. Hassan was diminishing. Mr. Sununu\\u2019s popularity soared last year over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, but it has been falling recently, to 56 percent in October from 64 percent in August, according to the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College.\", \"The governor is a moderate Republican who in 2018 vetoed a bill to fund paid family leave through a state payroll tax. He has called himself a \\u201cpro-choice\\u201d supporter of Roe v. Wade, but this year he signed a ban on abortions after 24 weeks, with no exceptions for rape, incest or the health of the mother.\", \"Mr. Sununu was re-elected in 2020 with 65 percent of the statewide vote. That was 20 percentage points better than what former President Donald J. Trump received when he lost New Hampshire to Mr. Biden last year. Unlike other Republican governors of blue states, such as Maryland or Massachusetts, Mr. Sununu supported Mr. Trump\\u2019s re-election, declaring at one point, \\u201cI\\u2019m a Trump guy through and through.\\u201d\", \"After Mr. Sununu\\u2019s announcement, Sabato\\u2019s Crystal Ball, a group that does political analysis at the University of Virginia\\u2019s Center for Politics, called the governor\\u2019s race a safe Republican seat. The two leading Democrats who pursued the seat in 2020 have taken themselves out of the running for next year.\", \"Mr. Sununu said he had heard from \\u201ccountless voices across the country\\u201d urging him to run for Senate. But he contrasted a senator\\u2019s job \\u201cdebating partisan politics without results\\u201d to being governor, where he might make \\u201ca dozen key decisions in a day\\u201d affecting people\\u2019s lives.\", \"In describing his decision, he seemed to go out of his way to belittle the role of a senator. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been criticizing Washington for a long time,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Sununu, however, did not shut the door on all jobs in Washington. Asked at his news conference whether he\\u2019d consider a cabinet job in a Republican administration, he said that he would. After Tuesday\\u2019s announcement, political insiders in New Hampshire ramped up speculation that Mr. Sununu likes being an executive so much, that he might aim to become the nation\\u2019s chief executive some day.\"]","href_hash":"0f394d6041cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0f394d6041cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
