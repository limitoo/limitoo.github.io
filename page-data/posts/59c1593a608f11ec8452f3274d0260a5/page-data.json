He will remind Americans that they can protect themselves from severe illness from COVID-19 by getting vaccinated and getting their booster shot when they are eligible.\\u201d\", \"The remarks will come as administration officials have faced new questions about how they will respond to the challenges of a pandemic that has persisted well beyond the administration\\u2019s expectations. Vice President Kamala Harris drew criticism this weekend for telling The Los Angeles Times in an interview that the administration was blindsided by the new variant and the one that preceded it, Delta, which drove spikes in infections and deaths from the virus this fall.\", \"\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t see Delta coming,\\u201d Ms. Harris told the newspaper. \\u201cI think most scientists did not \\u2014 upon whose advice and direction we have relied \\u2014 didn\\u2019t see Delta coming. We didn\\u2019t see Omicron coming. And that\\u2019s the nature of what this, this awful virus has been, which as it turns out, has mutations and variants.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden has both sounded an alarm over Omicron this month while also counseling hope in the face of it, expressing optimism that the fast-spreading variant would not set back the progress the country has made to regain a sense of normalcy in recent months. \", \"After initially imposing a set of travel restrictions on certain countries, including South Africa, where the variant was first detected, Mr. Biden\\u2019s response to the variant has leaned heavily on imploring Americans to get vaccinated, including booster shots. \", \"For the unvaccinated, the president said on Thursday, \\u201cwe are looking at a winter of severe illness and death \\u2014 if you\\u2019re unvaccinated \\u2014 for themselves, their families, and the hospitals they\\u2019ll soon overwhelm. But there\\u2019s good news: If you\\u2019re vaccinated and you had your booster shot, you\\u2019re protected from severe illness and death \\u2014 period.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Psaki has fielded repeated questions in recent weeks over whether administration officials had revised their economic forecasts to account for Omicron. On Friday, she told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to South Carolina that federal surge teams were helping communities handle a surge in cases in hard-hit states like Colorado, Michigan and Vermont.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s not a new assessment that they have provided or new recommendations that they have provided to date\\u201d on the economic effects of those caseload increases, she said. \\u201cBut that\\u2019s obviously a conversation that\\u2019s happening internally, as we look at not just the new variant, but any cases of \\u2014 any surges that we\\u2019re seeing in communities across the country. And, of course, we\\u2019ll continue to assess any new steps that need to be taken.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"59c1593a608f11ec8452f3274d0260a5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"59c1593a608f11ec8452f3274d0260a5"}},
