This lawsuit demonstrates that the NRA broke the law by illegally coordinating with federal campaigns and funneling millions of dollars to candidates who supported their extremist, deadly agenda,\\\" David Pucino, a senior staff attorney at Giffords Law Center, said in a statement.\", \"Pucino added, \\\"We are suing the NRA to finally hold them accountable for actions that corrupted politicians and undermined our democracy.\\\"\", \"The complaint claims the gun rights powerhouse evaded federal regulations by using shell entities to coordinate advertising with seven candidates running for federal office during the 2014, 2016 and 2018 election cycles.\", \"One of those candidates, the lawsuit alleges, was former President Donald Trump.
