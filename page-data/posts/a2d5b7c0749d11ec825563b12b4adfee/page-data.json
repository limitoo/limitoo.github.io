It has revoked the license of a Chinese-backed broadcaster, suspended an extradition treaty with Hong Kong and granted visas to tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents in the aftermath of a security law from Beijing that stifles political dissent. In a much-watched case in 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson largely banned the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei from providing equipment for Britain\\u2019s 5G network. \", \"In response, China has sanctioned several British lawmakers and groups for their public criticisms of the government, including their repression of Uighurs, a Muslim minority.\", \"Top officials have in the past cited China\\u2019s political reach as a concern. Richard Moore, chief of MI6, the country\\u2019s foreign intelligence service, said in a speech in November that the agency\\u2019s \\u201csingle greatest priority\\u201d was adapting to a world where China\\u2019s power is rising. He warned that Chinese intelligence services were seeking to conduct \\u201clarge scale espionage operations\\u201d against Britain and its allies.\", \"The notice from MI5 was published by several British news media outlets and its authenticity was confirmed by the Office of the Speaker of Parliament. It warned that a woman identified as Christine Ching Kui Lee had \\u201cacted covertly\\u201d through the United Front Work Department, a branch of the Chinese Communist Party devoted to furthering the government\\u2019s agenda in the world. The branch had sought to \\u201ccultivate relationships with influential figures in order to ensure the U.K. political landscape is favorable to the C.C.P\\u2019s agenda,\\u201d the notice said. \", \"Ms. Lee, a lawyer, was also openly affiliated with two other groups, the China Overseas Friendship Association and the British-Chinese Project, the statement said, using the cover of representing the British Chinese community to obscure her activities on the behalf of the Chinese government.\", \"Ms. Lee had been involved in the \\u201cfacilitation of financial donations to political parties,\\u201d lawmakers and potential candidates for public office in Britain and to \\u201cpolitical entities\\u201d on behalf of foreign nationals, the statement said. She had \\u201cextensive engagement with individuals across the U.K. political spectrum,\\u201d and she had been involved in informal cross-party groups run by lawmakers known as All-Party Parliamentary Groups, the statement added.\", \"Those contacted by Ms. Lee, the notice cautioned, should be \\u201cmindful of her affiliation with the Chinese state and remit to advance the C.C.P.\\u2019 s agenda in U.K. politics.\\u201d \", \"Efforts to reach Ms. Lee on Thursday were unsuccessful.\", \"\\u201cI know it will be deeply concerning to many that an individual who has knowingly engaged in political interference activities on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party has targeted\\u201d lawmakers, Priti Patel, Britain\\u2019s home secretary, said in a statement.\", \"Nevertheless, she added, the revelation was a sign of the structures Britain had in place to identify foreign interference or any potential threats to democracy.\", \"Iain Duncan Smith, a Conservative lawmaker who has been sanctioned by China, said that the presence in British politics of an active agent of the Chinese government was \\u201ca matter of grave concern,\\u201d adding that it put people seeking refuge in Britain from the Chinese Communist Party at risk. \", \"Tom Tugendhat, a leading voice on foreign policy in Parliament, said on Twitter that the current case illustrated the need to maintain vigilance against foreign interference.\", \" \\u201cIt is clear that the challenge from Beijing is increasing, and we need to defend our democracy against hostile activity,\\u201d said Mr. Tugendhat, who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select committee.\", \"\", \"\"]","href_hash":"a2d5b7c0749d11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a2d5b7c0749d11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
