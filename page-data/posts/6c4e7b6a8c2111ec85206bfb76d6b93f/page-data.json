It could only be reached by walking eight days from the nearest village. And the schoolchildren who were expected to star in the film knew nothing about acting or cinema.\", \"\\u201cThey did not even know what a camera was or what it looked like,\\u201d Namgay Dorji, the village schoolteacher, said in a telephone interview.\", \"On Tuesday, the movie, \\u201cLunana: A Yak in the Classroom,\\u201d was nominated for an Academy Award \\u2014 a first for Bhutan. Its director, Pawo Choyning Dorji, said he had been on an \\u201cimprobable journey\\u201d ever since deciding to shoot the film, his first, in a Himalayan village about three miles above sea level.\", \"\\u201cIt was so improbable that I thought I wouldn\\u2019t be able to finish,\\u201d said Mr. Dorji, 38, who is from a rural part of Bhutan that is east of Lunana.\", \"\\u201cSomehow we now find ourselves nominated for an Oscar,\\u201d he added. \\u201cWhen I found out, it was so unbelievable that I kept telling my friends: \\u2018What if I wake up tomorrow and I realize all this was a dream?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"\\u201cLunana,\\u201d which was released digitally on Friday, tells the story of a young teacher from Bhutan\\u2019s capital, Thimphu, who is assigned to work at a remote mountain school against his will. He dreams of quitting his government job, emigrating to Australia and pursuing a career as a singer.\", \"But the teacher, Ugyen, is fascinated by the people he meets in Lunana \\u2014 particularly 9-year-old Pem Zam, a radiant student with a difficult home life. As the months go by, he begins to take his job more seriously.\", \"Mr. Dorji, who wrote the script, said he made a teacher the protagonist after reading news reports about Bhutanese educators quitting their jobs. He saw that as a symbol of discontent in a poor, isolated country where globalization has caused profound social changes.\", \"Bhutan prides itself on measuring, and maximizing, the \\u201cgross national happiness\\u201d of its roughly 750,000 people. But Mr. Dorji said young Bhutanese increasingly believe that true happiness lies abroad, in places like Australia, Europe or New York City.\", \"He said he picked the Lunana Valley as the film\\u2019s setting because it presented a dramatic contrast with a \\u201cwell-lit\\u201d foreign city. The area is isolated even by the standards of this remote Himalayan kingdom; in Dzongkha, the national language, lunana means \\u201cdark valley.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMy idea was: Can we discover in the shadows and darkness what we are so desperately seeking in the light?\\u201d Mr. Dorji, who divides his time among Bhutan, India and Taiwan, said in an interview from Taipei, Taiwan.\", \"Turning his vision into a movie was a giant undertaking. The Lunana Valley borders far western China, has glacial lakes and some of the world\\u2019s highest peaks, and cannot be reached by car. When health workers administered coronavirus vaccines there last year, they had to fly in by helicopter and walk from village to village through snow and ice.\", \"When Mr. Dorji\\u2019s film crew traveled to Lunana in the late summer of 2018, they transported their firewood, batteries, solar chargers and other essential gear on mules. They brought nonperishable rations, such as of dried pumpkin and mushrooms, because there was no refrigeration. And when they arrived, they had to build their own temporary housing.\", \"There was just enough solar power to shoot the movie on a single camera, but not enough for Mr. Dorji to review his footage each night after shooting, as most directors do. So he had to go by his instincts and hope for the best.\", \"His cast presented another challenge. The three main roles were played by nonprofessional actors from Thimphu. The others were all from Lunana \\u2014 a place where families survive through subsistence agriculture and by harvesting a valuable alpine fungus \\u2014 and had never even seen a movie.\", \"\\u201cThe camera in front of them could have been a yak, for all they cared,\\u201d Mr. Dorji said.\", \"Mr. Dorji said he adapted to his characters\\u2019 lack of experience by tailoring the script to their lives, encouraging them to essentially play themselves. Pem Zam, for instance, goes by her real name in the movie.\", \"Mr. Dorji also shot scenes in the order in which they appear in the film, so that his actors could let their characters develop with the story. He also added scenes that he felt were poignant examples of real village life. One example: In a scene where Ugyen teaches his students how to use a toothbrush, they aren\\u2019t acting; they really didn\\u2019t know.\", \"The result is a film that successfully captures a sense of innocence, the Oscar-winning director Ang Lee told Mr. Dorji in a video call last month. He described \\u201cLunana\\u201d as a \\u201cbreath of fresh air.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a precious, precious, very simple but very touching movie,\\u201d Mr. Lee said. \\u201cThank you for going through all that and sharing your country and culture with us.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cLunana\\u201d is Bhutan\\u2019s first Oscar entry since \\u201cThe Cup,\\u201d a 1999 film that was written and directed by Mr. Dorji\\u2019s teacher Khyentse Norbu. That film, which chronicles the arrival of television in a monastery, was not shortlisted or nominated for an Academy Award.\", \"The Bhutanese government submitted \\u201cLunana\\u201d for last year\\u2019s Oscars, but it was disqualified: The national film committee had gone so long without submitting a film for consideration that it was no longer officially recognized by the Academy.\", \"For the 2022 awards, the country formed a special selection committee. And in December, \\u201cLunana\\u201d was among 15 shortlisted of 93 Academy Award submissions from around the world. On Tuesday, it was one of five films \\u2014 alongside others from Japan, Denmark, Italy and Norway \\u2014 nominated for an Oscar in the International Feature Film category.\", \"Karma Phuntsho, the selection committee\\u2019s chairman, said \\u201cLunana\\u201d reflects the maturation of a domestic film industry that\\u2019s only about three decades old.\", \"\\u201cI have been encouraging my friends in the film industry to look beyond the small Bhutanese market and share our stories with the world,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPawo has done that with a flair and it is a proud moment for all Bhutanese and friends of Bhutan.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Dorji said the film was made on a $300,000 budget \\u2014 \\u201cpeanuts when it comes to filmmaking\\u201d \\u2014 and that he never expected to have much help publicizing it. Now it\\u2019s being distributed by Samuel Goldwyn Films and marketed by a public relations agency with offices in New York and Beverly Hills.\", \"News of the film\\u2019s success has trickled back to Lunana, according to Kaka, a 51-year-old village headman there who goes by one name. \\u201cThe people back home are happy that their village has become known to the world,\\u201d he said by telephone.\", \"Namgay Dorji, 35, the real-life schoolteacher whose experience of living in the Lunana Valley for a decade inspired parts of the script, said the film\\u2019s international success had inspired him to stay in the area longer than he had once planned to.\", \"\\u201cWhen I was in front of the camera, I wasn\\u2019t that excited,\\u201d said Mr. Dorji, the schoolteacher, who appeared in the film as an extra. \\u201cBut after watching it and listening to the children\\u2019s dialogue, I realized how much hardship our community has had to overcome.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6c4e7b6a8c2111ec85206bfb76d6b93f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6c4e7b6a8c2111ec85206bfb76d6b93f"}},
