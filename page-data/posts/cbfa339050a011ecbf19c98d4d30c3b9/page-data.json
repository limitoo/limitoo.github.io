The variant may be more transmissible and better able to evade the body\\u2019s immune responses, both to vaccination and to natural infection, than prior versions of the virus, experts said in interviews.\", \"The vaccines may well continue to ward off severe illness and death, although booster doses may be needed to protect most people. Still, the makers of the two most effective vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, are preparing to reformulate their shots if necessary.\", \"\\u201cWe really need to be vigilant about this new variant and preparing for it,\\u201d said Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.\", \"\\u201cProbably in a few weeks, we\\u2019ll have a better sense of how much this variant is spreading and how necessary it might be to push forward with a variant vaccine,\\u201d Dr. Bloom said.\", \"Even as scientists began vigorous scrutiny of the new variant, countries around the world curtailed travel to and from nations in southern Africa, where Omicron was first identified. Despite the restrictions, the virus has been found in a half-dozen European countries, including the United Kingdom, as well as Australia, Israel and Hong Kong.\", \"Already, Omicron accounts for most of the 2,300 new daily cases in the province of Gauteng, South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Sunday. Nationally, new infections have more than tripled in the past week, and test positivity has increased to 9 percent from 2 percent.\", \"Scientists have reacted more quickly to Omicron than to any other variant. In just 36 hours from the first signs of trouble in South Africa on Tuesday, researchers analyzed samples from 100 infected patients, collated the data and alerted the world, said Tulio de Oliveira, a geneticist at the Nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine in Durban.\", \"Within an hour of the first alarm, scientists in South Africa also rushed to test coronavirus vaccines against the new variant. Now, dozens of teams worldwide \\u2014 including researchers at Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna \\u2014 have joined the chase.\", \"They won\\u2019t know the results for two weeks, at the earliest. But the mutations that Omicron carries suggest that the vaccines most likely will be less effective, to some unknown degree, than they were against any previous variant.\", \"\\u201cBased on lots of work people have done on other variants and other mutations, we can be pretty confident these mutations are going to cause an appreciable drop in antibody neutralization,\\u201d Dr. Bloom said, referring to the body\\u2019s ability to attack an invading virus.\", \"South African doctors are seeing an increase in reinfections in people who already had a bout of Covid-19, suggesting that the variant can overcome natural immunity, said Dr. Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases physician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.\", \"Omicron has about 50 mutations, including more than 30 in the spike, a viral protein on its surface that the vaccines train the body to recognize and attack.\", \"Some of these mutations have been seen before. Some were thought to have powered the Beta variant\\u2019s ability to sidestep vaccines, while others most likely turbocharged Delta\\u2019s extreme contagiousness.\", \"\\u201cMy best guess is that this combines both of those elements,\\u201d Penny Moore, a virologist at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, said of the new variant.\", \"But Omicron also has 26 unique spike mutations, compared with 10 in Delta and six in Beta. Many of them seem likely to render the variant more difficult for the immune system to recognize and thwart.\", \"\\u201cThere are many we\\u2019ve never studied before, but just looking at the location on the spike, they are in regions that we know are immuno-dominant,\\u201d Dr. Moore said, referring to parts of the spike protein that interact with the body\\u2019s immune defenses.\", \"Dr. Moore\\u2019s team is perhaps the furthest along in testing how well the vaccines hold up against Omicron. She and her colleagues are preparing to test blood from fully immunized people against a synthetic version of the Omicron variant.\", \"Creating such a \\u201cpseudovirus\\u201d \\u2014 a viral stand-in that contains all of the mutations \\u2014 takes time, but results may be available in about 10 days.\", \"To more closely mimic what people are likely to encounter, another team led by Alex Sigal, a virologist at the Africa Health Research Institute, is growing live Omicron, which will be tested against the blood of fully immunized people, as well as those who were previously infected.\", \"Those results may take longer but should provide a fuller picture of the vaccines\\u2019 performance, Dr. Sigal said.\", \"If the vaccines prove to be much less potent against Omicron, they may need to be tweaked to enhance their effectiveness. Preparing for the worst, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson are planning to test an artificial version of Omicron against their vaccines.\", \"The mRNA vaccines in particular \\u2014 Moderna\\u2019s and Pfizer-BioNTech\\u2019s \\u2014 were built with technology that should permit rapid modification. Pfizer\\u2019s scientists \\u201ccan adapt the current vaccine within six weeks and ship initial batches within 100 days in the event of an escape variant\\u201d that eludes the immune system, said Jerica Pitts, a spokeswoman for Pfizer.\", \"Moderna\\u2019s work began on Tuesday, immediately after its scientists learned of Omicron \\u2014 the fastest the company has ever responded to a variant, said Dr. Stephen Hoge, Moderna\\u2019s president.\", \"Even without data on Omicron\\u2019s spread, it was obvious the variant would be a formidable threat to vaccines, he said.\", \"\\u201cThis thing is a Frankenstein mix of all of the greatest hits,\\u201d Dr. Hoge said, referring to the variant\\u2019s many concerning mutations. \\u201cIt just triggered every one of our alarm bells.\\u201d\", \"Moderna could update its current vaccine in about two months and have clinical results in about three months if necessary, he said.\", \"Both companies also plan to test whether booster shots will bolster the immune system enough to fend off the new variant. Boosters of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been shown to raise antibody levels significantly.\", \"But those antibodies may not be broadly effective against every iteration of the virus, and may not be enough to neutralize Omicron entirely, said Michel Nussenzweig, an immunologist at Rockefeller University in New York.\", \"People who recover from Covid and then receive even one dose of a vaccine tend to produce a broader range of antibodies, capable of recognizing more versions of the virus, than do people who are only vaccinated.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s clear that hybrid immunity, the kind that people get when they are both infected and vaccinated, is superior, and that is very, very likely to take care of this thing, too,\\u201d Dr. Nussenzweig said.\", \"\\u201cAfter two doses of vaccine, we did not see that. But we\\u2019re hoping that after three doses, maybe there\\u2019ll be some catching up,\\u201d he said.\", \"Dr. Nussenzweig and his colleagues are preparing to test Omicron against the mRNA vaccines, as well as the vaccines made by Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. They hope to have results within a month.\", \"Omicron-specific vaccines created in just weeks would be a miraculous feat. But the prospect of producing and distributing them raises daunting questions.\", \"If new versions are required to protect people everywhere, companies should make them available to the African countries that most need them and can least afford them, Dr. de Oliveira said.\", \"\\u201cSouth Africa at least has managed to procure their own vaccines,\\u201d he said. But poorer countries like Sudan, Mozambique, Eswatini and Lesotho will need low-cost options.\", \"Pfizer did not respond to a question about low-cost vaccines for African nations. Dr. Hoge, of Moderna, said the company already had an agreement with the African Union to deliver 110 million doses at $3.50 per half dose of vaccine.\", \"Dr. Hoge said he recognized that 110 million was less than 10 percent of Africa\\u2019s population. But, he noted, \\u201cwe\\u2019re also the smallest of all manufacturers out there, and so 10 percent hopefully is useful.\\u201d\", \"Despite the frustration that South African scientists have expressed about vaccine inequity and punishing travel restrictions, they have been inundated with requests for genetic sequences of Omicron from Italy, Germany, Australia and New Zealand, as well as labs in North America.\", \"The more teams involved, the better, said Dr. Moore, who received about 50 requests just on Saturday. As the virus moves across the globe, it is likely to keep changing. \\u201cGetting the right combination of mutations in itself is a moving target,\\u201d she said.\", \"Researchers everywhere want to avoid drawing conclusions prematurely, a mistake they made when the Beta variant surfaced. Preliminary tests of that variant took only one known mutation into account and underestimated its ability to evade the immune system, Dr. Moore recalled. (Fortunately, the variant also turned out to be less contagious.)\", \"To get a full picture of the effectiveness of the vaccines against Omicron, scientists must look not just at antibody levels but also at immune cells that can recognize and destroy infected cells. Immune cells called T cells are crucial for preventing an infection from progressing to serious illness and death.\", \"Some of Omicron\\u2019s mutations occur in parts of the virus targeted by T cells, meaning the variant may be more difficult for T cells to recognize.\", \"Already, a computer simulation has predicted that those mutations may alter about six of the hundreds of regions that T cells can recognize, said Wendy Burgers, an immunologist at the University of Cape Town.\", \"That may not seem like much. But people make varying sets of T cells, so depending on which targets the mutations knock out, some people may barely be affected by Omicron \\u2014 and others may be left vulnerable.\", \"Dr. Burgers is hoping to obtain blood from 50 people infected with the variant to gauge how the mutations will play out across a population. Once the samples are in hand, results will be available after \\u201cprobably a week of very late nights and analysis,\\u201d she said.\", \"Even if the vaccines hold up against Omicron, new versions will probably be needed at some point, and perhaps soon. The virus is acquiring mutations much faster than expected, Dr. Bloom said.\", \"Seasonal influenza is the often cited example of a virus that mutates quickly, requiring regular updates to vaccines. But the coronavirus is \\u201cat least comparable and possibly even faster than that,\\u201d Dr. Bloom said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s always going to be new variants arising.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"cbfa339050a011ecbf19c98d4d30c3b9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cbfa339050a011ecbf19c98d4d30c3b9"}},
