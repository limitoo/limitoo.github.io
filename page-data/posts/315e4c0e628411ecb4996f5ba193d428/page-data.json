He used these funds to attempt to trade his way out of his losses, but in doing so dug himself and his investors into deeper financial trouble,\\\" Read said.\", \"Tonkin's fraud was revealed by a staff member.\", \"\\\"It is important that investors are able to trust the advice and information provided by those managing their money. Actions such as Mr Tonkin's undermine this trust and threaten the integrity of financial markets,\\\" Read said.\", \"Tonkin's sentence is one of the longest for a fraud since Wellington investment manager David Ross was jailed for 10 years and 10 months for running a Ponzi scheme in which investors lost $115m. Ross served six years before being released on parole.\", \"RNZ\", \"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"315e4c0e628411ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"315e4c0e628411ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
