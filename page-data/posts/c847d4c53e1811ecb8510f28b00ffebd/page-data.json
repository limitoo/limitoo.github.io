Mr. Owens, then beginning his senior year, was quick to introduce himself.\", \"\\u201cHe was very attractive,\\u201d said Mr. Owens, now 30. \\u201cHe was very standoffish. He was like, Heeeeyyy. \\u201d\", \"Mr. Johnson, now 26, agrees that this was definitely the case. But when the two met again a few weeks later, at a \\u201cwater-ice social\\u201d (an event anyone outside of Philadelphia would call a party featuring Italian ice), they ended up as partners in a game of spades. The game tends to be long. The two got to know each other.\", \"They became friends with much in common: two gay, Black men who had close relationships with their families. One topic they stood on opposite sides of, though, was vegetarianism. (Mr. Owens said that, to this day, \\u201cI\\u2019m a big, huge meat eater,\\u201d while Mr. Johnson was then strictly eating plant-based foods).\", \"Even as friends, Mr. Owens said that he had a \\u201ccrush.\\u201d But \\u201cit wasn\\u2019t in my mind that, Oh, this could be something.\\u201d Their friendship, he added, had a lot to do with companionship: \\u201cHey I\\u2019m at this dining hall \\u2014 meet me,\\u201d or \\u201cCatch you here.\\u201d\", \"The men were chatting every day by the time the winter break of Mr. Johnson\\u2019s freshman year rolled around and each went home for the holidays. (Mr. Owens to Houston; Mr. Johnson to Trenton, N.J.) That\\u2019s when things changed.\", \"[Click here to binge read this week\\u2019s featured couples.]\", \"\\u201cI would say he is the most consistent man I\\u2019ve ever met in my life,\\u201d Mr. Owens said of Mr. Johnson. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a man of his word, he\\u2019s never broken a promise, he\\u2019s always been someone who is very present and attentive, he always pays attention to little things.\\u201d\", \"When Mr. Johnson returned to campus in Philadelphia after the break, he was ready to come out to his mother. Mr. Owens advised him.\", \"\\u201cHe was really helpful in walking me through it,\\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \\u201cThat, for me, took our relationship, our friendship, to the next level.\\u201d\", \"Both men graduated from Penn, and Mr. Owens went on to receive a master\\u2019s degree in communication management from the University of Southern California. He is now a freelance journalist, editor at large of Philadelphia magazine and the president of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists. Mr. Johnson is a media specialist at Community College of Philadelphia and consults and teaches classes about cocktails.\", \"Their first foray into the public together as men who might be more than friends was at a birthday party in January 2014. They shared a first kiss that night.\", \"Just a couple of weeks later, on the eve of Valentine\\u2019s Day, they had a frank discussion about their status, which ultimately resulted in the two announcing on social media that they were a couple.\", \"By the time Mr. Johnson graduated from Penn, in 2017, he had decided that his first relationship would be one that endured. \\u201cDefinitely after graduation, I knew I would one day want to marry him, and propose,\\u201d he said.\", \"The day for that proposal came on Christmas Eve in 2019, when the two were in Houston to celebrate the holiday with Mr. Owens\\u2019s family. A photo of Mr. Johnson down on one knee at the city\\u2019s Gerald D. Hines Waterwall Park made the rounds on the couple\\u2019s social media.\", \"The pandemic didn\\u2019t infringe on their plans for a wedding at the Penn Museum in the city where they\\u2019ve spent most of their relationship. On Oct. 16, Michelle Fitzhugh-Craig, a Universal Life minister, officiated at their wedding. They had 110 guests, all fully vaccinated.\", \"A neat little bit of chronological symmetry made their marriage into a bookmark of their relationship: They made their romance public four days before Mr. Johnson\\u2019s birthday, and they married four days after Mr. Owens\\u2019s birthday.\", \"\\u201cAs I\\u2019ve gotten older, I realize that looks evolve and fade, and people\\u2019s true value doesn\\u2019t,\\u201d Mr. Owens said. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a great-looking man, but he\\u2019s also a great man period. And that\\u2019s important.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c847d4c53e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c847d4c53e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}},
