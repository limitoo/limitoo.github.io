That's a really long time to be in a situation you don't want to be in,\\\" she said. \\\"I'm just grateful honestly for each day and being able to have the keys to my car and being able to be independent and feel like a woman and owning an ATM card, seeing cash for the first time, being able to buy candles.

My voice was muted and threatened for so long and I wasn't able to speak up or say anything and because of you guys and awareness of kind of knowing what was going on and delivering that news to the public for so long, you gave it awareness to all of it,\\\" she said. \\\"And because of you, I honestly think you guys saved my life in some way. 100%.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Li Cohen is a social media producer and trending reporter for CBS News, focusing on social justice issues.\"]","href_hash":"9db83b3347bd11eca204093294fb90de"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9db83b3347bd11eca204093294fb90de"}},
