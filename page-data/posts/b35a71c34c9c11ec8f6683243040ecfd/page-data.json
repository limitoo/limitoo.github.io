controversial to suggest that gas would help with the transition away from coal-fired power systems to ones running on renewable energy.\", \"Gas is a fossil fuel and its exploitation produces emissions including methane, which is a much more potent global warming agent than carbon \\u2014\\u00a0at least in the short term.\", \"But the burning of gas for electricity still produces significantly less carbon dioxide than coal \\u2014 about half as much, according to the government's official US Energy Information Administration.\", \"And unlike contemporary renewable energy technologies, gas-fired power plants can also affordably provide the \\\"firming\\\" services that are imperative to stable and secure electricity grids, where supply and demand have to be matched perfectly at all times.\", \"It is not an option for governments to let the lights go out when \\\"the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing\\\".\", \"Yet whatever tolerance there might have been for gas a few years ago would appear to be vanishing faster than a fugitive emission from a drilling well.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Scarborough on climate\\u00a0'front'</div>\", \"<img

coal in North Asian countries.(Reuters: Jason Lee)</div>\", \"Earlier this year, the International Energy Agency left major producers reeling by declaring there should be no new major oil and gas developments if the world wants to keep global warming in check.\", \"Added to this has been a groundswell of opposition to fossil fuel projects among major investors across the world, including in Australia where superannuation funds have been beating the drum against gas.\", \"Throw in\\u00a0anti-fossil fuel sentiment from the Glasgow climate conference and you've got a decidedly more hostile environment for oil and gas proposals.\", \"Which is how Woodside's Scarborough project has found itself suddenly thrust onto the front line in the war against fossil fuels\\u00a0by those concerned about rising emissions.\", \"It is a far cry from a few years ago when the project was relatively unknown outside the business community and was deemed to be a commercial no-brainer.\", \"There were many reasons that confidence in Scarborough had \\u2014\\u00a0until recently \\u2014\\u00a0been so high.\", \"Among the most obvious was its importance to the future of Woodside, which has been Australia's homegrown oil and gas champion for decades.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Woodside without a choice</div>\", \"Put simply, Woodside didn't have a better development option in its pipeline of projects for the future.\", \"Scarborough was a big reservoir that would provide gas to sell into the seemingly insatiable markets of North Asia for up to 30 years.\", \"<img

\\\"project for our times\\\".(ABC News: Daniel Mercer)</div>\", \"Oil and gas producers such as Woodside rely on a business model of mega projects, which cost vast sums of money to build but which make even more money over the decades in which they operate.\", \"These projects provide the cash that funds the next project, and on it goes.\", \"Given it had been almost 15 years since Woodside's last major growth project, the first phase of its Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility, the company was starting to run short of time and needed to reset the clock.\", \"For a top-20 company on the Australian stock exchange worth $20 billion \\u2014 soon to be worth $40 billion once the merger with BHP's petroleum arm goes through\\u00a0\\u2014 the impulse to get Scarborough over the line must have been overwhelming.\", \"It would have hardly hurt that gas prices have been trading at record highs across Asia and Europe in recent weeks and months as demand for the fuel outstrips supply.\", \"Besides the commercial impulse, Woodside is not wrong to suggest Scarborough is a relatively low carbon dioxide field, so long as you keep the comparisons to other oil and gas fields.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Carbon count 'lower than rest'</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b7c65f4800d1bfa532838b1924cc39b7\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Protesters have been intensifying their campaign against gas projects such as Scarborough.(ABC News: Evelyn Manfield)</div>\", \"According to the company, the Scarborough field contains about 0.1 per cent carbon dioxide.\", \"By way of comparison, the massive nearby Gorgon reserve operated by US giant Chevron has a carbon dioxide content approaching 14 per cent\\u00a0amounting to millions of tonnes of extra emissions.\", \"This is relevant because, in the normal course of events, the carbon from these gas fields would have to be vented into the atmosphere unless it could be stored underground \\u2013 or sequestered, as the industry calls it.\", \"While Chevron has pursued a policy of carbon capture and storage for Gorgon, it is a process that has\\u00a0been blighted by problems and there are questions about whether it can work.\", \"As Australia moves towards a net zero target by 2050, such an overhang of carbon would need to be offset through measures such as the purchase of credits or the planting of trees,\\u00a0all things that cost money.\", \"So, in a world where carbon is not only a reputational but economic risk, Scarborough was at an advantage compared with other potential gas projects around the globe.\", \"But where it gets trickier for Woodside is in the use of the gas.\", \"<div

extracted from the Scarborough field, piped 430 kilometres onshore to Karratha, chilled in a processing plant and loaded on to a ship, will be used for power, heating, and industry in China, Japan, and South Korea.\", \"There, that gas will be a major source of carbon\\u00a0to the tune of almost 900 million tonnes, according to Woodside's own estimates.\", \"Granted, the gas could displace dirtier coal in those countries' energy systems, but that is not enough for many.\", \"Therein lies the rub for the opponents of hydrocarbon projects.\", \"Scarborough is, they say, completely incompatible with the targets set out under the 2015 Paris Agreement, which called for temperature rises to be kept to 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the worst effects of global warming.\", \"Woodside will feel as though it has scraped over the line with Scarborough before public opinion and policy risked making the project untenable.\", \"But it is a fair bet the company wishes it had made the decision a couple of years ago when coal was feeling most of the climate heat and gas was largely being left alone.\", \"In any case, a fairer bet would be that Scarborough is the last of its kind to be developed in Australia.\", \"The era of the mega LNG project, for this country at least, appears to be over.\"]","href_hash":"b35a71c34c9c11ec8f6683243040ecfd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b35a71c34c9c11ec8f6683243040ecfd"}},
