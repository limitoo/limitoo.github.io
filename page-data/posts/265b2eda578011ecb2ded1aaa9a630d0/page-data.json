It's likely still going to be weeks before the true nature of the variant is determined, but Fauci doesn't believe it will be \\\"worst-case scenario.\\\"\", \"Fauci, who serves as President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, told the Agence France-Presse that Omicron is \\\"clearly highly transmissible.\\\" He added that it's likely more transmissible than Delta, another variant of interest that's the dominant strain worldwide.\", \"However, he said it \\\"almost certainly is not more severe than Delta,\\\" which could be good news. The \\\"worst-case scenario,\\\" according to Fauci, would be a variant that's highly transmissible and also causes severe disease.\", \"This would lead to another wave of infections that isn't curbed by vaccinations or prior infections, causing significant strain on health systems that have already been pushed to the brink because of Delta.\", \"This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946912/anthony-fauci-omicron-transmissible-severe-disease.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Dr. Anthony Fauci told the AFP it appears the Omicron variant will be more transmissible than Delta but less severe.
