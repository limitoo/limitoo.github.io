With a daily bag limit of five paua that is about 5000 daily bag limits.\\\"\", \"Vaughan said there were indications that there had been many days with over 1000 bag limits taken.\", \"\\\"The challenge is that there is no real time data to capture how much biomass has been removed from the fishery.\\\"\", \"Niwa is currently undertaking a survey but the data would not be available until after the season had finished at the end of February.\", \"While people were generally sticking to the limits, the large numbers gathering and the easy access to p\\u0101ua, which could be found in very shallow water, meant the fishery was vulnerable.\", \"Vaughan said while the group would support an early closure of the three-month season, it would impact the whole community and there was not enough time for full consultation before the scheduled closure at the end of February.\", \"Without data to show how much p\\u0101ua had been removed, it was difficult to change the regulations mid-season.\", \"But the group was advocating for the daily catch limit to be reduced from five p\\u0101ua per person, to two.\", \"\\\"Be respectful of our coastline, don't strip areas, because the fishery is still very vulnerable and the message really is if we want the fishery available for future generations, we need to just gather for a feed, not for the freezer.\\\"\", \"Vaughan said the group was keen to undertake strategic community consultation with Te R\\u016bnanga o Kaik\\u014dura and the Kaik\\u014dura Boating Club to provide a clear plan to the government to ensure long-term sustainability of the fishery.\", \"MPI fisheries compliance regional manager Howard Reid said the season had been incredibly busy, with people travelling from the North Island to the deep south in order to collect the shellfish.\", \"Most people were sticking to the rules, but officers were starting to see more undersized p\\u0101ua among people's catch.\", \"In December, a single diver was caught with 249 p\\u0101ua in suitcases and in January, the case is still under investigation.\", \"\\\"There's certainly been cars parked in every single available space along the coast this summer, particularly since Christmas. It's just been very busy. There's been some large groups of people travelling long ways to have a go at the p\\u0101ua.\\\"\", \"DOC senior marine biodiversity ranger in Kaik\\u014dura Dr Jody Weir says since the p\\u0101ua fishery re-opened, there had been a huge increase in poaching from the nearby Hikurangi Marine Reserve.\", \"Many of the p\\u0101ua displaced in the Kaik\\u014dura earthquake were moved into the reserve, which had become a stronghold for the region's marine biodiversity.\", \"\\\"What we found is that many people are sort of looking for a place to pull over along the coast to get their p\\u0101ua, they see the pull over in front of the marine reserve. Apparently don't notice all of the signage, and think it's a great place to pull over and walk in and find great p\\u0101ua.\\\"\", \"While most people were doing the right thing, DOC had to increase staffing in the region over Christmas to patrol the marine reserve.\", \"\\\"Because this area has been so protected if it were to be damaged considerably, which is what our fear is, then we would lose that.\", \"\\\"We would lose our nice, big spawners that are in the nearshore, at least and we could lose that integrity of what it means to have an area that we just leave alone and we don't take from.\\\"\", \"Te Runanga o Kaik\\u014dura kaihaut\\u016b Chevelli Allen said a lot of work was done in order to reopen the fisher and it was always going to be the case that some people took more than they needed.\", \"He said ultimately, future decisions on the p\\u0101ua fishery at Kaik\\u014dura came down to the people and how they treated the resource.\", \"Allen said if the environment had been pillaged, as was being talked about in the community, it would become clear in the monitoring data.\", \"The marine environment was extensively surveyed before the season opened and will be assessed again after the season ends in February.\"]","href_hash":"f9c667c2780911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f9c667c2780911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
