There's been unprecedented demand for what's supposed to be a short-term housing option, made much worse by COVID, stretching back to last year's lockdown, with the result many vulnerable people, including wh\\u0101nau with children, are in motels as a last resort - some for up to a year.\", \"RNZ has reported stories of people terrified of conditions in some accommodation amid commonplace instances of violence, criminal activity and gang intimidation - both residents, and those living and running businesses nearby. In September this year, there were about 4500 children living in emergency accommodation.\", \"Despite a number of requests for information, the police have consistently refused to make any comment to RNZ, but now it's emerged they hold reports covering emergency housing-related offences, the impact on the wider community and demands on police, dating back to July 2020. They are standing by their original statement.\", \"RNZ first approached police in April, asking whether they kept \\\"any records about incidents reported from emergency accommodation\\\" and if there had been \\\"any noticeable or recorded increase in complaints or incidents in emergency accommodation\\\". We also asked if the police were \\\"taking any specific action in response to, or interest in, criminal activity, gang presence or any other elements causing disorder or potential harm to others\\\" and whether they had \\\"any concerns about the environments created by some emergency housing, in terms of public safety\\\".\", \"In response, RNZ was told by a police spokesperson in a phone call they did not systematically collect data that would specifically link offences or police call-outs to emergency housing locations, so could not make any comment.\", \"Over the course of the following week, it became very apparent from speaking to Ministry of Social Development (MSD) clients, nearby residents, businesses and social services, police officers were being regularly called out to deal with incidents - some extremely serious.\", \"RNZ went back to the police on that basis, acknowledging what we'd been told about the availability of data, but asking to \\\"speak to someone about what police are seeing on the ground and what's being done where people are feeling particularly at risk\\\".\", \"Police responded with a statement saying police recognised \\\"community concerns about a perceived increase in crime linked to emergency housing\\\".\", \"\\\"We are taking these concerns seriously and are committed to investigating all reports of crime, regardless of where they occur - police does not collect data specifically in relation to emergency housing.\\\"\", \"Fast forward to December, when RNZ was provided with a number of police reports and a series of inter-agency communications, with extensive data information about offences and police call-outs, as part of Official Information Act requests released to the National Party, clearly showing an actual increase in crime.\", \"RNZ went back to the police, asking how the statement about not collecting data could be squared with the existence of these documents.\", \"\\\"It remains accurate, as we do not routinely compile figures in relation to emergency housing,\\\" police replied on Friday.\", \"\\\"The OIA you have received includes some reports compiled for specific areas and operational purposes. We do not have equivalent data for every premise classified by MSD as 'emergency housing.'\\\"\", \"\\\"The facts are clear,\\\" said National's Housing spokesperson Nicola Willis, who's also struggled to get information out of the police this year.\", \"\\\"Reports were gathered that showed escalating levels of crime and emergency housing.\", \"\\\"The police had those reports and yet they have stonewalled attempts by media and the Opposition to get that information - that is very concerning.\\\"\", \"An 'Intelligence Notification' report, with large parts, redacted and dated the month before RNZ's first request, March 25, \\\"identifies the offences and harm at the locations since they have been used as emergency accommodation... and compares these numbers to the same time period in the previous year\\\" in the Waitemat\\u0101 East District.\", \"Its conclusions - the \\\"severity and seriousness\\\" of offending had increased at emergency accommodation in that area;

the large number of children living in motels in a concentrated area. The children in this situation are at the forefront of local Police's minds (author's own emphasis)\\\", it went on to say.\", \"\\\"They note that these children are being housed alongside high needs individuals in cramped circumstances... local police highlighted that for children, in particular, living in a motel is not a good long-term solution.\", \"\\\"Increase in family harm reporting e.g. family harm has increased from an average of 70 incidents per week in November 2019 to an average of 100 incidents per week in November 2020.\\\"\", \"There's later discussion on May 4 about an \\\"urgent meeting\\\" of a number of DCEs, scheduled for that Friday, in response to media coverage and work underway to \\\"better support wh\\u0101nau in emergency housing in Rotorua as a priority area and Ministers are focused on ensuring we are coordinating our placement of wh\\u0101nau in other areas\\\".\", \"By mid-May, these senior officials were meeting on a weekly basis \\\"to identify what should be done\\\".\", \"Internal police communications at that time sum up four issues that \\\"may be amenable to intervention\\\":\", \"On May 17 2021 there was an email from an MSD official to the Waikato District Prevention Manager, a police Inspector, referring to \\\"concerns raised by the following police officers, Detectives (names redacted) - child protection team\\\".
