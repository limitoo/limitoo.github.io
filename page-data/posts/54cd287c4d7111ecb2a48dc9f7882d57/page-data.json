Many of those books are aspirational reads, and technically inactive. On the top layer, and not inactive, are the New Oxford Annotated Bible; \\u201cThe Poetry of Robert Frost: Collected Poems\\u201d; Joseph Brodsky\\u2019s \\u201cCollected Poems in English\\u201d; \\u201cThe House on Marshland,\\u201d a collection by Louise Gl\\u00fcck; \\u201cOn the Trail of Genghis Khan: An Epic Journey Through the Land of the Nomads,\\u201d by Tim Cope; and \\u201cSermons in Stone: The Stone Walls of New England and New York,\\u201d by Susan Allport.\", \"What\\u2019s the last great book you read?\", \"I just reread \\u201cLabyrinths,\\u201d by Jorge Luis Borges, whose essays are like humor pieces, only more brilliant, and beyond funny. Some are about heresies and heresiarchs. I like the word \\u201cheresiarch.\\u201d It\\u2019s a good job description, maybe even for a humorist.\", \"Are there any classic novels that you only recently read for the first time?\", \"Somehow I had missed \\u201cThe Age of Innocence,\\u201d by Edith Wharton. The descriptions of Manhattan in the 1870s \\u2014 the houses, the streets, the clothes people wore \\u2014 knocked me flat, especially because you can look at some of the same places today and it\\u2019s as if you never saw them until you read her. I like the way her old-time New Yorkers talked. Now that I\\u2019m old myself, I plan to affect their style. I\\u2019ve started calling Central Park \\u201cthe Central Park.\\u201d\", \"Can a great book be badly written? What other criteria can overcome bad prose?\", \"A book can be great for all kinds of reasons. I recently read James Fenimore Cooper\\u2019s first best seller, \\u201cThe Spy.\\u201d Its subtitle is \\u201cA Tale of the Neutral Ground,\\u201d and it takes place during the Revolutionary War, in what\\u2019s now Westchester and the Bronx. He tackled a painful subject \\u2014 local neighbor-against-neighbor conflict during the war \\u2014 and he set it in a highly romantic key, \\u00e0 la Sir Walter Scott. To my mind, it doesn\\u2019t work at all, but readers loved it. It was great because of what he tried to do, and especially because of his books that followed it.\", \"\\u201cWhat Is to Be Done?,\\u201d by Nikolai Chernyshevsky, published in Russia in 1863, is the worst book I ever read. But it was monumental in its influence on the revolutionary generation in Russia. Chernyshevsky saw something huge and powerful up ahead, expressed it clumsily, and changed his country.\", \"Of course, neither of those books is a great work of art. I thought the writing in \\u201cThe Idiot\\u201d was occasionally dumb, but it didn\\u2019t matter. The book is a great work of art because of the cataclysmic Dostoyevsky.\", \"Describe your ideal reading experience (when, where, what, how).\", \"Reading a book in the place where it takes place or where it was written. The first Hemingway novels I ever read were Scribner paperbacks that I bought for a couple bucks each at the gift shop in the Hemingway Home & Museum in Key West. I read them in the house where my grandmother lived, a mile or so away. I was 13 or 14. Another example: I had never been a fan of Bellow, but I bought a copy of \\u201cRavelstein\\u201d at the University of Chicago bookstore and read it in one sitting in a Chicago hotel \\u2014 totally thrilling and absorbing. I read a collection of Russian short stories, including \\u201cThe Shot,\\u201d by Pushkin, and \\u201cTaman,\\u201d by Lermontov, in Nome, Alaska, in a fogged-in hotel a short flight from the Russian border. I\\u2019d never had such a wonderful time.\", \"What\\u2019s your favorite book no one else has heard of?\", \"Here again I have to turn to Russia. \\u201cThe Life of the Archpriest Avvakum by Himself\\u201d is the autobiography of a priest who opposed the reform of the Orthodox Church in the 17th century. Avvakum Petrovich was a fanatic, a mad fulminator, and he dared the authorities to make a martyr of him, which they finally did. But somehow he kept a sense of perspective about his crazy self. The translation I read, a beautiful little book, was published by Leonard and Virginia Woolf in 1924. I like to think the Woolfs got a kick out of Avvakum.\", \"Which writers \\u2014 novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets \\u2014 working today do you admire most?\", \"My close family \\u2014 my wife, the novelist Jacqueline Carey, and my children, Cora Frazier and Thomas Carey Frazier \\u2014 are amazing writers, and many of my close friends are writers, too, and I greatly admire them all. I have to single out my lifelong friend Jamaica Kincaid, because her most recent novel, \\u201cSee Now Then,\\u201d is hilarious. Among writers I don\\u2019t know well or at all, I admire David Mamet, Thomas McGuane, Annie Proulx, Louise Gl\\u00fcck, Les Murray, Julian Barnes, Lawrence Wright, Larissa MacFarquhar, Sally Rooney, Michael Greenberg, and N. Scott Momaday.\", \"Your own writing toggles between deeply researched and reported books like \\u201cGreat Plains\\u201d or \\u201cFamily,\\u201d and more casual humor pieces like those in \\u201cCoyote v. Acme\\u201d or \\u201cCranial Fracking.\\u201d Does your reading lean more heavily in one direction or the other? And who are your favorite writers in each mode?\", \"In terms of volume, I don\\u2019t read a large number of humor books, because good ones are rare. The ones I like I read over and over. I read more nonfiction than anything else. Favorite nonfiction writers (here I must veer into the \\u201cfriends\\u201d category) are Janet Malcolm, John McPhee and Joseph Mitchell. Jack Handey\\u2019s humor collection, \\u201cWhat I\\u2019d Say to the Martians,\\u201d can be read again and again. Charles Portis (whom I met once in Little Rock) wrote great American books that are also transcendently funny. In the humor department I also love to read Calvin Trillin, Garrison Keillor and Roy Blount Jr.\", \"What do you read when you\\u2019re working on a book? And what kind of writing do you avoid?\", \"When I\\u2019m working I read anything that comes to hand. I don\\u2019t avoid anything.\", \"Do you count any books as guilty pleasures?\", \"Books about Western gunfighters, outlaws and white-trash border ruffians, such as \\u201cThe Killer Legions of Quantrill,\\u201d by Carl W. Breihan.\", \"What\\u2019s the last book that made you laugh?\", \"\\u201cUntrue Stories of Fiction,\\u201d by Jack Handey.\", \"Has a book ever brought you closer to another person, or come between you?\", \"I can\\u2019t think of a book that has come between me and anybody. As for bringing me closer \\u2014 Janet Malcolm found a set of the 13-volume \\u201cTales of Anton Chekhov,\\u201d put out by Ecco Press in 1984, and she sent it to me, and I read it and we talked about it, story by story. She had written a book about Chekhov and edited collections of his stories herself. I had only read \\u201cThe Island,\\u201d Chekhov\\u2019s nonfiction book about his journey across Siberia to the prison colony on Sakhalin, and \\u201cThe Lady With the Dog.\\u201d I knew very little about him, Janet knew everything. That was a great last present she gave me.\", \"What\\u2019s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently?\", \"In Jonathan Alter\\u2019s excellent biography of Jimmy Carter, \\u201cHis Very Best: Jimmy Carter, a Life,\\u201d I learned that the former president and Berry Gordy Jr., founder of Motown Records, are second cousins. Carter\\u2019s mother, Lillian Gordy Carter, was the granddaughter of James Jackson Gordy, a slave owner who fathered a second set of Gordy children by a woman he enslaved. Jimmy Carter and Berry Gordy share a great-grandfather, and are therefore half-second cousins, technically. Why neither Carter nor Berry Gordy ever made more of this remarkable fact I don\\u2019t know.\", \"Which subjects do you wish more authors would write about?\", \"I don\\u2019t know \\u2014 how about the world\\u2019s largest beaver dam? It\\u2019s in northern Alberta, Canada, and very hard to get to. Supposedly it\\u2019s the largest animal-made structure visible from space. I would like to write about it myself, but no editors are interested. (Write about it, that is, without actually going there.)\", \"Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?\", \"I generally avoid science fiction and historical fiction. I\\u2019m more interested in what actually happened or is likely to happen, rather than in what somebody imagines happened or possibly might happen. But that\\u2019s not a hard-and-fast rule \\u2014 e.g. \\u201cThe Big Sky\\u201d and \\u201cThe Way West,\\u201d exciting historical novels by A. B. Guthrie Jr. Also, \\u201cDune\\u201d (not \\u201cDune Messiah\\u201d).\", \"How do you organize your books?\", \"Some are organized by subject, like the American West or fishing, but most are in a jumble.\", \"What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?\", \"\\u201cStanding Firm,\\u201d by Dan Quayle, and \\u201cThe Gift of Rest,\\u201d by Senator Joe Lieberman, both inscribed copies. They\\u2019re the beginning of a vice-president-related book collection that has fallen short of its acquisitions target.\", \"What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you the most?\", \"I read \\u201cThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\u201d constantly and loved it so much I avoided \\u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\\u201d because I sensed it was critical of Tom. But then I read \\u201cHuckleberry Finn\\u201d and re-re-read it; and \\u201cTom Sawyer,\\u201d though still beloved, receded into the happy past. Mark Twain is the basic and foundational writer for me.\", \"How have your reading tastes changed over time?\", \"I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019ve changed. That is, they continue to fluctuate. I read fiction, then go back to nonfiction. Throughout the swerves I cling to poetry because what with the internet and everything, sometimes I\\u2019m unsure what is up with prose. But poetry is always poetry.\", \"If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?\", \"If I could require the president to do a thing, I would go so mad with power \\u2014 it scares me even to think about it. He should read Emily Dickinson\\u2019s \\u201cTo Make a Prairie\\u201d until he has it memorized, then recite it every day. He could always fit it in his schedule. It\\u2019s short, only 27 words.\", \"You\\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?\", \"The thought of setting up this kind of dinner party voluntarily seems madness. But if I had to, I would invite Leonard and Virginia Woolf, and Henry Adams. Leonard and Virginia and I could discuss Avvakum, and I\\u2019m sure Adams would know how to talk to the Woolfs, and they could converse while I pretended to do stuff in the kitchen.\", \"Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel as if you were supposed to like, and didn\\u2019t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?\", \"I found \\u201cTristram Shandy\\u201d less hilarious than various English departments had led me to believe it would be. It\\u2019s basically a sermon, and sermons are among the four things that should never try to be funny. (The other three are in-flight announcements, voice mail messages from your doctor, and ballets.) I did like Sterne\\u2019s parody of the rite of excommunication, which I guess falls into the category of heresies. The last book I put down without finishing was Joyce\\u2019s \\u201cA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,\\u201d but only because it was painfully vivid.\", \"What do you plan to read next?\", \"I just started \\u201cTo the Break of Dawn: A Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic,\\u201d by Jelani Cobb. It\\u2019s a combination of a memoir and a history of hip-hop, and it\\u2019s fascinating.\"]","href_hash":"54cd287c4d7111ecb2a48dc9f7882d57"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"54cd287c4d7111ecb2a48dc9f7882d57"}},
