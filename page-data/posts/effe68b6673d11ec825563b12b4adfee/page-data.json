We were struggling to even be competitive the last time we played them.\", \"\\\"It's one of those things where I'm stoked of the turnaround between games and the performances, and the girls really stepped up.\", \"\\\"But conceding in the late stages of the game is always a hard one to swallow, especially when I think we had moments to nick it.\\\"\", \"The Phoenix did create chances of their own, with Chloe Knott, Kelli Brown, Grace Wisnewski and Zoe McMeeken, but weren't able to beat Jets goalkeeper Georgia Boric.\", \"The Kiwi side can also feel hard done by, with a penalty shout against Knott denied by the referee - as the striker went to ground inside the area under a challenge.\", \"\\\"From where I was standing it looked like there was a lot in the back and the ankles were clipped,\\\" adds Lewis.\", \"\\\"Chloe was trying to hold her ground and she couldn't and she kind of got pushed through.
