The children were chosen by Mexican social service organizations, like those that work with children whose parents were deported from the U.S.\", \"Mexico has refused to vaccinate minors ages 12 to 17 partially because the government focused on older adults thought to be more vulnerable. The nation also has little vaccine supply for its minors. This month, the country is starting to prepare to vaccinate teens ages 15 to 17. Youths currently make up one-third of Mexico's population.\", \"Leslie Flores, 14, was one of the children who received a shot Thursday.
