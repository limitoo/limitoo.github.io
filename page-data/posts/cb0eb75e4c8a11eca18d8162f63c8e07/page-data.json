The Foreign Affairs Ministry said that in 2019, at least 17,000 homicides were linked to trafficked weapons. According to the Associated Press, the country's officials estimate that 70 percent of weapons trafficked to Mexico came from the U.S.\", \"In the lawsuit, the government said that the companies not only knew that their practices were contributing to weapons trafficking in Mexico but were facilitating it. They demanded compensation and policy changes from the companies.\", \"The suit was filed against large gunmakers including Beretta U.S.A. Corp., Smith & Wesson, Colt's Manufacturing, Glock Inc., and Sturm, Ruger & Co. The suit also includes Interstate Arms, a Boston-area wholesaler that sells guns from most of those manufacturers to dealers around the country.\", \"Gun manufacturer Beretta argued that the Mexican government has no proof connecting their sales in Massachusetts to the crimes mentioned in the suit. They also argued that the Massachusetts court does not have jurisdiction, as Beretta is based in Maryland and the harm described in the suit occurred in Mexico.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938802/beretta-gun.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Mexican government has sued U.S. gun manufacturers, including Beretta, for allowing their weapons to be trafficked into the country, leading to what they say is 17,000 shooting deaths.
