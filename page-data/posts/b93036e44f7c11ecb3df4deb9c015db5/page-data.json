As 2022 approaches and the new Omicron variant prompts alarm, they are calibrating their booster strategies at a time when the virus is crashing through highly vaccinated countries in Europe where boosters are not yet widely available.\", \"The European Union\\u2019s public health agency recommended on Wednesday that all adults receive a booster shot, especially people over 40. On Thursday, its executive arm proposed that residents of the bloc will need booster shots to avoid tests or quarantines when traveling to other E.U. member states.\", \"Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization's director general, has also warned against a \\u201cfalse sense of security\\u201d over the protection offered by vaccines. \\u201cNo country is out of the woods,\\u201d he said at a news conference on Wednesday.\", \"Officials from highly vaccinated nations in East and Southeast Asia are well aware.\", \"Singapore, which has one of the world\\u2019s highest Covid vaccination rates, has administered two doses to nearly nine in ten residents, according to a New York Times tracker. After authorizing third doses for seniors on Sept. 14 \\u2014 a few days before both Britain and the United States \\u2014 the city-state is now giving booster shots to people 30 and above, as well as to health care and frontline workers over age 18.\", \"Other Asian countries are ahead of Europe in expanding access to boosters. Already, officials in Cambodia, Malaysia and Japan \\u2014 countries where nearly 80 percent or more of the populations are fully vaccinated \\u2014 have announced plans to give boosters to all adults.\", \"And last week in South Korea, where nearly four in five people are fully vaccinated, the government reduced the period between second and third doses from six months to as few as four. It also expanded eligibility for shots to people 50 and over, after opening third shots to high-risk adults and those 60 and over in late October. \", \"Kwon Jun-wook, director of the country\\u2019s National Institute of Health, has said that South Korea weighed Europe\\u2019s situation in considering its own vaccine strategy.\", \"\\u201cIn those countries, the first wave of infections after countries began reopening were mostly among the unvaccinated,\\u201d he told reporters last week. \\u201cThen infections gradually expanded to the group with waning immunity after getting vaccinated. Now we are seeing countries in Europe and, needless to say, the United States, struggle very hard to return to normalcy.\\u201d\", \"While studies have shown that the effectiveness of vaccines can wane over time, the need for boosters has been the subject of intense debate.\", \"Critics say that wealthy nations must stop hoarding doses. Earlier this month, Dr. Tedros described the global disparity in Covid vaccine access \\u201ca scandal that must stop now,\\u201d noting that six times more booster shots were being administered globally than primary doses in low-income countries.\"]","href_hash":"b93036e44f7c11ecb3df4deb9c015db5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b93036e44f7c11ecb3df4deb9c015db5"}},
