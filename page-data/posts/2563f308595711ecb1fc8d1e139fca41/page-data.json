The group immediately filed a notice of appeal on Thursday.\", \"\\u201cThe abortion industry\\u2019s lawsuit abuses the judicial system and turns this court into a mere platform for airing criticisms against the boldest pro-life law to take effect since Roe v. Wade,\\u201d Kimberlyn Schwartz, a Texas Right to Life spokeswoman, said in a statement.\", \"The abortion law, known in Texas as Senate Bill 8 or the \\u201cheartbeat law,\\u201d prohibits abortions after cardiac activity has been detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy. By expressly prohibiting state officials from enforcement, and relying instead on individuals, the law avoided the usual process of legal scrutiny and went into effect in September after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to step in.\", \"The Supreme Court heard arguments about the law last month as part of an expedited process and is expected to rule soon.\", \"The court has also been weighing arguments over a Mississippi law in a case seen as a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that prevented states from banning abortions before fetal viability. The Mississippi law bans the procedure after 15 weeks, or about two months before viability.\", \"In Texas, abortion providers have said they were abiding by the new law because of the threat of legal action from any individual against someone who performs or \\u201caids and abets\\u201d the procedure, including clinic staff or even the person who provided transportation to the clinic.\", \"\\u201cWe have said all along that in order to fully restore abortion access in Texas, we need a decision in the U.S. Supreme Court or the Texas Supreme Court,\\u201d said Julie Murray, a senior staff attorney at Planned Parenthood. \\u201cToday\\u2019s decision is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough relief for abortion providers.\\u201d\", \"In his opinion, Judge Peebles wrote that the Texas Legislature did not have a right under the state\\u2019s Constitution to allow people who had not suffered any injury from a violation of the abortion law to come into court and sue. He also found that the granting of awards of \\u201cno less than $10,000\\u201d to anyone successful in their suits violated the right to due process under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\", \"Judge Peebles wrote that the law\\u2019s mechanism of delegating enforcement power to private citizens, if found constitutional, could be applied to all manner of contentious issues, including guns, same-sex marriage, freedom of speech and climate change.\", \"\\u201cWe are a diverse and creative people and it seems na\\u00efve to hope that these procedures will be cabined voluntarily,\\u201d he wrote.\", \"Abortion providers said that if the ruling were upheld by the State Supreme Court, they would again begin providing abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy because the law could not be enforced.\", \"The number of abortions performed in Texas fell by roughly half in the weeks after the law went into effect, a fact that anti-abortion groups have credited to the law\\u2019s unique structure.\"]","href_hash":"2563f308595711ecb1fc8d1e139fca41"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2563f308595711ecb1fc8d1e139fca41"}},
