Just a year later 31 people earned over $400,000 in 2020/2021. This number excludes chief executives, of whom many also earn over $400,000.\", \"The figures have been released this morning by the Public Service Commission, covering all 36 agencies and departments.\", \"The total cost of personnel in what's deemed Core Crown departments has risen 35.8 percent in the last four years since the Labour Government took office.\", \"There's been a 21 percent increase in the number of people earning over $100,000 compared to the year prior, rising from 15,055 to 18,301 public employees.
