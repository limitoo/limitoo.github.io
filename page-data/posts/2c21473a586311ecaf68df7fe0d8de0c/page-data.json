Democrats did little to stop them.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-08T20:13:19.000Z","content":"[\"The foreign-policy journalist Joshua Keating used to write a series for Slate called \\u201cIf It Happened There,\\u201d in which he reported on political and cultural developments in the United States in the tone of an American foreign correspondent sending dispatches from a nation on the other side of the globe.\", \"Keating\\u2019s series was partly a joke about Western paternalism. But by illuminating the terrifying fragility of our own glass house, the trope also offered Americans the powerful gift of perspective. For instance, see how Keating\\u2019s headline on the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia \\u2014 \\u201cDeath of Hard-Line Jurist Throws Regime Into Chaos\\u201d \\u2014 neatly underlined the quaint capriciousness of a political system in which one unelected judge\\u2019s sudden demise can call into question fundamental rights across the land.\", \"As an immigrant to the United States from one of the world\\u2019s long-troubled regions, I\\u2019ve found myself thinking of Keating\\u2019s series quite a lot this year. Adopting an outsider\\u2019s point of view has helped to clarify the terrible stakes of the political game now playing out across the country \\u2014 and has filled me with a sense of deep despair and foreboding.\", \"Because if the assaults on democracy that occurred in America in 2021 had happened in another country, academics, diplomats and activists from around the world would be tearing their hair out over the nation\\u2019s apparent unraveling. If you were a reporter summing up this American moment for readers back home in Mumbai, Johannesburg or Jakarta, you\\u2019d have to ask whether the country is on the brink: A decade from now, will the world say that 2021 was the year the United States squandered its democracy?\", \"If that sounds hyperbolic, consider the year\\u2019s many lowlights. Begin, of course, on Jan. 6: \\u201cFollowers of Ousted President Storm National Legislature.\\u201d Then, when Republicans in Congress turned against an independent inquiry into the Capitol attack and punished the few in their party who supported it: \\u201cBowing to Former Strongman, Opposition Blocks Coup Investigation, Expels Dissenters.\\u201d Or when, despite turning up no evidence of significant electoral mischief in the 2020 presidential election, Republican-led legislatures in more than a dozen states began pushing new laws to restrict voting rights, including several that put partisan officials in charge of election administration: \\u201cProvincial Lawmakers Alter Election Rules to Favor Deposed Premier.\\u201d\", \"And then last month, when more than 150 academic scholars of democracy put out a letter urging Congress to pass legislation to protect American elections from partisan takeover. Headline: \\u201cExperts Sound Alarm Over Democratic Backsliding in Nuclear-Armed Superpower.\\u201d Pull quote: \\u201cThis is no ordinary moment in the course of our democracy,\\u201d the scholars wrote. \\u201cIt is a moment of great peril and risk.\\u201d\", \"I\\u2019m a through-and-through lefty, but I want to emphasize that my concern here is not really a partisan one. There are some places where Democrats are also monkeying with electoral machinery in a partisan manner \\u2014 in Illinois, Democrats redrew congressional districts to overwhelmingly favor their party. In some ways these efforts anger me more than the Republican tricks, because they undermine the left\\u2019s moral standing to uphold electoral integrity. And upholding democratic integrity ought to be a paramount goal \\u2014 because without it the basic idea of America, that this is a nation of laws by and for the people, would fall apart.\", \"There\\u2019s another reason I\\u2019m more upset at the left than the right: Republicans are acting unethically, but also rationally, out of political necessity. They see their coalition diminishing. The Republican base is white and Christian in a nation that is growing more diverse and less religious. The party has lost the popular vote in all but one presidential election since 1992. Its fortunes would seem to depend on reducing access to the polls and, if that fails, on embracing the electoral strategy Donald Trump made explicit in 2020 \\u2014 when the results don\\u2019t go the way you like, push to overturn them.\", \"The Democrats\\u2019 survival depends on the very opposite idea: on letting people vote, counting their votes and respecting the count. In this sense Democratic efforts to expand and uphold voting rights ought to be just as urgent as the Republicans\\u2019 efforts to restrict them.\", \"Yet that is not the case: While Republicans have put the undermining of democracy at the top of their political agenda, Democrats appear to have put voting rights at the bottom of theirs.\", \"\\u201cI regard this as the great political clash of our time,\\u201d said Michael Waldman, the president of the Brennan Center for Justice at N.Y.U. School of Law, a policy institute that focuses on democracy and political reform. \\u201cOn the one hand you have states rushing to restrict the vote or change who counts the vote. On the other hand, you have Congress, which has the power to stop it cold, legally and constitutionally.\\u201d The important question, Waldman said, is whether the Democrats have the political will to stop it.\", \"\\u201cSo far, the answer would seem to be, not yet,\\u201d he said.\", \"President Biden offered a strong defense of voting rights in a speech in July. He called Republican efforts to put partisan officials in charge of election results \\u201cthe most dangerous threat to voting and the integrity of free and fair elections in our history.\\u201d He called passing strong federal election rules \\u201ca national imperative.\\u201d\", \"And then, crickets. Biden has said little in public since then about the issue. The Freedom to Vote Act, the Democrats\\u2019 comprehensive proposal to protect voting rights and undo Republican anti-democratic efforts, is stalled in the Senate. In their letter, the democracy scholars called on Democrats to suspend the filibuster in order to pass the bill, but that seems increasingly unlikely \\u2014 Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have repeatedly said they oppose that idea.\", \"If Democrats fail to uphold the integrity of our elections, what then? I fear total loss. Not for the party, but for the country. If Republicans prevail, America will become one of those faraway, seemingly lawless places where every election is in doubt and no part of our political culture remains above the partisan fray.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s like the Titanic,\\u201d said Pippa Norris, a political scientist at Harvard who was a signatory of the letter urging passage of the Freedom to Vote Act. \\u201cWe know there\\u2019s an iceberg out there. We\\u2019re looking at it. It\\u2019s in our faces and it\\u2019s getting closer.\\u201d\", \"Democrats have a narrow window now to \\u201crecognize the existential threat not just to their party but to the country as a whole,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut if they don\\u2019t do that, then the ship is going to hit the iceberg.\\u201d And then we\\u2019re all sunk.\", \"Farhad wants to chat with readers on the phone.
