To accommodate the high-profile matchup, the A.P. delayed its weekly poll update for just the second time ever.\", \"The rout also offers clues about how these two teams might fare later in the season, both during their next regular season game against each other \\u2014 in Columbia, S.C., on Jan. 27 \\u2014 and through the deep postseason runs both teams are expected to make toward the Final Four.\", \"Despite remarkable performances from the teams\\u2019 stars, the story of the game lay in its fundamentals: turnovers and offensive rebounds.\", \"The Huskies (3-1) went into halftime with a 3-point lead but could not generate any points from turnovers or offensive rebounds during the second half. The Gamecocks (6-0) forced 19 turnovers, capitalizing on them for 21 points.\", \"\\u201cWe just took the shots they gave us,\\u201d South Carolina Coach Dawn Staley said on ESPN after the game.\", \"UConn\\u2019s sloppiness, uncharacteristic of the long-dominant program, is something that the team, particularly its young core, will have to work on.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve got a long time before we go down there and play them again,\\u201d Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma told reporters after the game. \\u201cBut right now, they\\u2019re better than us. We\\u2019re going to have to work really, really hard.\\u201d\", \"The Gamecocks, in contrast, played sharp and turned to their signature defense in the second half, allowing Connecticut to score just 3 points in the fourth quarter against tight man-to-man coverage.\", \"The junior forward Aliyah Boston nearly had a double-double in the first half, and ended the game with 22 points and 15 rebounds \\u2014 the kind of performance that South Carolina is relying on her to deliver throughout the season.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s time for Aliyah Boston to be the dominant player she is,\\u201d Staley said.\", \"The guards Zia Cooke and Destanni Henderson are the other two keys to the South Carolina offense. Cooke had 17 points worth of circus shots, while Henderson\\u2019s veteran savvy manifested in speedy transition baskets and a well-balanced stat line of 15 points, 4 rebounds, 6 assists and 6 steals.\", \"Overall, the team showed its depth \\u2014 and that it has ample room to grow. If, for example, the Gamecocks can get Kamilla Cardoso, a 6-foot-7 transfer from Syracuse, more involved in the paint, they might have an easy answer for a tough interior defense like Connecticut\\u2019s.\", \"This was the first big test of the season for the Huskies. UConn guard Paige Bueckers, the team\\u2019s leading scorer, delivered a number of showstopping baskets, and in the first half the Huskies\\u2019 ball movement looked nearly transcendent. That rhythm, though, disintegrated in the second half, when only Bueckers had more than one field goal.\", \"Connecticut will have plenty of shooters ready to help, though, once it reduces some of its more basic mistakes. The redshirt senior guard Evina Westbrook was the spark for the Connecticut offense early, and the team\\u2019s second leading scorer. With more opportunities, she might be able to lift some of the offensive load off Bueckers.\", \"Azzi Fudd, a highly regarded freshman, barely played Monday after scoring 18 points against the University of South Florida on Sunday, a decision Auriemma attributed to her inability to move within South Carolina\\u2019s stifling defense. With more time in college basketball\\u2019s big leagues, though, Fudd might become a consistent scoring threat.\", \"Connecticut needs to fix its flaws in the coming months if it wants to establish the kind of dominance that for more than decades has made it the foremost team in women\\u2019s college basketball.\", \"In Monday\\u2019s win, the Gamecocks didn\\u2019t reveal such shortcomings. The adjustments they needed could be handled during the game and not left for a future practice.\", \"The road to the Final Four won\\u2019t be easy for any team in the sport. But with this statement victory, South Carolina suggested that is firmly on course.\"]","href_hash":"13d462f14d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"13d462f14d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}},
