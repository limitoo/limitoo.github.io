Once inside, they were able to locate her mother's body. The mother, whose name and age at death have not been disclosed to the public, died of natural causes a few days prior to Memorial Day, according to an autopsy conducted by the state medical examiner.\", \"Heller was arrested on November 18 and charged with abuse of a corpse. She is accused of conducting the scheme so that she could keep collecting her mother's Social Security checks, which authorities found were still being deposited into an account following her death. She is scheduled to be arraigned on January 6 in the 9th Circuit Court in Merrimack.\", \"\\\"Bedford Police have contacted the federal Social Security Administration Office of the Inspector General,\\\" the department statement reads, \\\"and are coordinating with the Inspector General's investigation as the investigation indicated that Heller's mother's Social Security payments were still being deposited into her bank account in the months following her death.\\\"\", \"In August, police arrested a woman in Lincoln, Arkansas, for a similar alleged crime. Deputies with the Washington County Sheriff's Office arrested Geanna Pike after finding the corpse of her mother, Gloria Pike, seemingly mummified with newspaper and hidden in her home. An investigation later found that Pike had stolen her dead mother's identity, using her \\\"check card\\\" for certain transactions. Pike claimed that her mother passed away in late 2020 and had owed her money that she had promised to pay back.\", \"In October 2020, a woman was arrested in Wisconsin for charges even more similar to Heller's. Paula Ann Bergold was accused of hiding her mother's dead body in a basement tub while continuing to collect her Social Security checks. Bergold claimed that her mother had passed away while sitting in a chair and that she could not bring herself to report the death to police.\"]","href_hash":"900a30fc55f411ecb3fbb77e56816942"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"900a30fc55f411ecb3fbb77e56816942"}},
