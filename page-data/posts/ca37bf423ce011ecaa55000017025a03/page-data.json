Galgut had been shortlisted twice before, in 2003 and 2010, and both times, the stress of the nominations \\u201cprobably shaved a few years off my life.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cFor a few weeks, you\\u2019re one of six winners, then all that attention gets sucked away and very, very suddenly, there\\u2019s only one winner, the rest of you are losers,\\u201d he told the Guardian in an interview in September.\", \"This year was different. On Wednesday, the Booker judges pronounced Galgut the winner, praising his novel for its \\u201cunusual narrative style that balances Faulknerian exuberance with Nabokovian precision, pushes boundaries, and is a testament to the flourishing of the novel in the 21st century.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe Promise,\\u201d Galgut\\u2019s ninth book, had already won acclaim among critics for its menacing and bleakly funny portrait of the Swart family, descendants of Dutch settlers who are desperately holding onto their farm and status in post-apartheid South Africa. Literary critics likened his experimental prose to modernist masters like Virginia Woolf, James Joyce and William Faulkner, while others noted his debt to fellow South African writer J.M. Coetzee.\", \"A review of \\u201cThe Promise\\u201d in The New York Times Book Review called Galgut \\u201ca gleeful satirist, mordantly skewering his characters\\u2019 fecklessness and hypocrisy.\\u201d\", \"Galgut got the idea for the novel, which Europa Editions published in the United States in April, from a conversation with a friend, who described going to a series of funerals for family members. It sounded like the perfect narrative vehicle for a family saga. Galgut began working on a novel centered on a family \\u2014 \\u201cjust an ordinary bunch of white South Africans,\\u201d he writes \\u2014 whose matriarch dies of cancer in 1986, when South Africa was convulsing with political unrest. The novel\\u2019s title refers both to the unrealized promise of social equality after the end of apartheid, and to the matriarch\\u2019s promise to leave a house to a Black servant, Salome, which causes a rift in the family.\", \"He set the novel in Pretoria, where he grew up, in part to explore the region\\u2019s dark history of apartheid and racial violence and the impact that had on his childhood.\", \"\\u201cEverything\\u2019s changed since then, and I wanted in some way to show what\\u2019s changed. I mean not only the future but also the options that are open,\\u201d Galgut said in a June interview with the Johannesburg Review of Books, noting that as a white South African man, he was set up in a position of privilege.\", \"\\u201cThe Promise\\u201d was one of six shortlisted novels and stood out for its artistry and scope, judges said.\", \"\\u201cThis is a book about inheritance and legacy,\\u201d Maya Jasanoff, the chair of the 2021 judges, said in a news conference on Wednesday. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a book that invites reflection over the decades.\\u201d\", \"American authors once again dominated the shortlist this year, accounting for three of the finalists. They were Richard Powers for \\u201cBewilderment,\\u201d Maggie Shipstead for \\u201cGreat Circle,\\u201d and Patricia Lockwood for \\u201cNo One Is Talking About This.\\u201d\", \"The other authors were the Sri Lankan writer Anuk Arudpragasam for \\u201cA Passage North,\\u201d about the lingering trauma from his country\\u2019s civil war, and the British and Somali novelist Nadifa Mohamed for \\u201cThe Fortune Men,\\u201d about a Somali man falsely accused of murder in Wales.\", \"The Booker Prize is awarded annually to the best novel written in English and published in Britain or Ireland, and was selected this year from 158 submitted novels. Last year, the award went to Douglas Stuart for \\u201cShuggie Bain,\\u201d his autobiographical debut novel about growing up in Scotland with an alcoholic mother. In 2019, breaking with tradition, the prize was awarded jointly to Bernardine Evaristo and Margaret Atwood.\", \"Since 2014, the prize has been open to any novel written in English and published in Britain. Previously, it was limited to writers from Britain, Ireland, Zimbabwe and the Commonwealth.\", \"Galgut is the third writer from South Africa to win the Booker, following Nadine Gordimer and Coetzee, who has won twice. Galgut began writing at a young age, and fell in love with books as a child, when he was bedridden with lymphoma and family members read to him to keep him occupied.\", \"He published his debut novel, \\u201cA Sinless Season,\\u201d in 1982, when he was just 17. His novel \\u201cThe Good Doctor,\\u201d published in England in 2003, was shortlisted for the Booker that year and won the Commonwealth Writers Prize. He made the Booker shortlist again in 2010 for \\u201cIn A Strange Room,\\u201d a novel about an alienated South African traveler named Damon, which straddled the line between fiction and memoir and prompted a debate over whether it should be eligible for a fiction prize.\", \"In the run-up to the 2010 Booker Prize, Galgut was jaded about his prospects. Asked by The Paris Review if he had learned anything from his previous experience on the shortlist, he said, \\u201cI\\u2019m approaching it with the knowledge of how awful it all is, which will hopefully make it less awful.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ca37bf423ce011ecaa55000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ca37bf423ce011ecaa55000017025a03"}},
