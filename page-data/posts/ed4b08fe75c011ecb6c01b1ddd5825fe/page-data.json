Lora, said he was urging residents to stay away from the area to allow firefighters from around the region to battle the 10-alarm blaze at the plant, which houses a company, Qualco, that manufactures chlorine for swimming pools. Mr. Lora said he was also asking residents to shut their windows to keep out the smoke.\", \"In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Lora said that about 100,000 pounds of chlorine in the plant had been \\u201cimpacted\\u201d by the fire, the heat from the flames or water from the firefighters\\u2019 hoses.\", \"As a result, he said, a Reverse 911 call went out to residents in the city and in Bergen County, advising them to keep their windows shut. He said, however, that the part of the plant where most of the chlorine was stored had not been affected.\", \"\\u201cWe are not at a place where we believe the danger or the threat would justify evacuations,\\u201d Mr. Lora said, adding that if there were toxic fumes, the firefighters \\u201cwould have been pulled from the site.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI am extremely concerned for the firefighters because of the proximity as well as the potential of the fire reaching the main plant,\\u201d Mr. Lora added. The fire, he said, was not yet under control.\", \"He estimated that more than 200 firefighters from the region had responded to the fire and said that one firefighter had sustained a minor eye injury.\", \"Mr. Lora said he had spoken to Gov. Philip D. Murphy, who dispatched state environmental and emergency management officials to the scene.\", \"\\u201cWe won\\u2019t be able to fully inspect until fire is completely put out,\\u201d Mr. Lora wrote on Facebook. \\u201cIt may take some time to establish cause. Main issue with chlorine fire is wind.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Murphy said on Twitter that he was urging \\u201ceveryone in Passaic to stay safe,\\u201d and he asked those near the fire to keep their windows closed.\", \"\\u201cPraying for the safety of our first responders on the scene,\\u201d Mr. Murphy wrote.\", \"Video posted on social media showed a large ball of flame erupting along the side of a highway as thick clouds of smoke roared into the sky. The flames drew crowds of onlookers, some of whom reported hearing explosions and seeing sparks.\", \"New York City officials said that residents there might see or smell smoke from the fire in Passaic, a city of about 70,000 residents, which is about 10 miles from Manhattan.\"]","href_hash":"ed4b08fe75c011ecb6c01b1ddd5825fe"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ed4b08fe75c011ecb6c01b1ddd5825fe"}},
