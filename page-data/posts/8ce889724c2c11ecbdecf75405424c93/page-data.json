For these historical cases of abuse, our trustees offer a sincere and heartfelt apology.\", \"\\\"Today we have communicated directly to all alumni to say we are sorry to all former students who suffered abuse while in our care, and for the failure of St Peter's to protect them from such abuse occurring.
