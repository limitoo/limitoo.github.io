He is married, just celebrated buying his first house and is planning to have a family.\\u00a0\", \"In an article for the police Ten One magazine released on Tuesday, he thanked the police officer who saved his life and made all of that possible.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"That night was a turning point in my life,\\\" the man said.\", \"\\\"Since then I have taken every chance and positive opportunity that's come my way. I just wanted to say thank you.\", \"\\\"Because Dylan was there and stopped me from hurting myself, I've had an incredible life.\\\"\", \"Sgt Robinson recalls the dramatic proceedings that resulted in him saving the then teenager's life.\\u00a0\", \"He received a phone call from a member of the public alerting him to a boy hanging his feet over the railing and looking ready to jump down into the Waipekakoura River and the rocky riverbanks.\", \"Sgt Robinson got to the scene and then the teen threatened to jump if the officer got any closer.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I managed to get closer to him during that time until I was less than two metres away,\\\" Sgt Robinson told Ten One magazine.\", \"The boy was facing forward with only one hand hanging onto the bridge behind him, when he said, \\\"I've had enough\\\".\", \"That was when Sgt Robinson burst into action.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I just remember thinking I had to get him back. He let go of the railings, leant forward and jumped,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"It happened so quickly.
