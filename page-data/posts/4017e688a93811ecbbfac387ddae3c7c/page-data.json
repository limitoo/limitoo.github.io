Nationwide, the average price for a gallon of regular gas is now more than $4.25, according to AAA.\", \"Gerdis' key word is \\\"gentle\\\" \\u2014 gentle acceleration and gentle braking. Many of his tricks involve subtle changes to driving, but they can make a big difference. One example is simply going the speed limit, even on the freeway. The faster you go, the more fuel you burn.\", \"\\\"Speed kills fuel economy. There's no way around it,\\\" Gerdis told CBS News' Kris Van Cleave.\", \"And little things add up. Gerdis also controls how often he uses the air conditioner.\", \"\\\"I'll run air conditioning when it gets above 80. I set it like 76 to 78 degrees because I want to just be comfortable,\\\" he said.\", \"Some hyper-milers make their cars more aerodynamic or drive behind semi-trucks to reduce wind resistance. Gerdis sticks to the slow lane and follows all traffic laws. He said his slow and steady approach to driving has been getting him well over 80 miles per gallon and cut his fuel consumption by about 40%, saving him about $2,500 a year.\", \"\\\"Every dollar I save in fuel is a dollar in my pocket,\\\" he said.\", \"Brian Cooley, editor at large for CNET, said those tips and tricks can be very useful.\", \"\\\"The optics can be bad to other drivers because it's not the normal pattern that we all follow,\\\" he said. \\\"Most of the tips in the hyper-milers playbook are smart and they're things we should have been taught back in driver training.\\\"\", \"Other ways to save fuel include keeping tires properly inflated and making vehicles as light as possible by taking unnecessary heavy items out of the trunk or even removing a roof rack if it's not being used.\"]","href_hash":"4017e688a93811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4017e688a93811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
