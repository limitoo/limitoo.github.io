She born to Hollywood royalty. Her father \\u2013 ventriloquist Edgar Bergen \\u2013 and his sidekick, Charlie McCarthy, were household names for generations of Americans. \", \"But his only daughter quickly made a name for herself, as a model, photojournalist, author, and movie star opposite more leading men than she can remember: Anthony Quinn, Harrison Ford, Sean Connery, Jack Nicholson, to name a few. She never took it all that seriously, until 1979, in \\\"Starting Over\\\" opposite Burt Reynolds. Like her father, comedy was to be her calling card.\", \"Comedy, said Bergen, \\\"was my only ability.\\\"\", \"\\\"Go on.\\\"\", \"\\\"I mean, I was just so comfortable doing it. And I had no vanity. As long as I get a laugh, I'm just in heaven.\\\"\", \"And of course, \\\"Murphy Brown,\\\" for which she won five Emmys for Best Actress in a Comedy. \", \"But lately a new milestone is testing her confidence: \\\"I'm 75. And I feel older. I just thought that if I'm going to get older, I would like to do it with credibility. So, I had these chasms on my lips, and I have a waddle, which is why I wear a turtleneck. But at least people can see how you look when you get older. I mean, 75 was like, 'Yeah. Time to get real.'\\\"\", \"She'd already suffered what she described as a frightening cluster of mini-strokes in her early 60's. \\\"I kind of sat like an old thing, and people brought me tea!\\\" she laughed. \\\"So, you know, stuff happens.\\\"\", \"She does know.

But it's more \\u2026. it's more. It's smaller because it's not scattered, and it's focused on what's in front of me.\\\"\", \"But nothing comes before the love of her life, daughter Chloe, who is just across the road with her husband and the first grandchild, Artie.\", \"\\\"So, this is kind of a mother-in-law house situation?\\\" asked Pauley. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"It is.
