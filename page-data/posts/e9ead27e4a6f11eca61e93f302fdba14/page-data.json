Mr. McClain, a 23-year-old Black man, died after the police in that city restrained him with a chokehold maneuver that has since been banned.\", \"The agreement, reached in principle in July, is the largest police settlement in the city\\u2019s history and among the biggest to result from similar cases in the United States, according to Qusair Mohamedbhai, the McClain family\\u2019s lawyer.\", \"Sheneen McClain, Elijah McClain\\u2019s mother, said in an interview on Saturday that she considers the settlement an important step in seeking justice for her son\\u2019s death but said that, \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing that can return to me what I lost.\\u201d She also said that the agreement comes with its own pain. \\u201cIt\\u2019s still blood money, because that money has my son\\u2019s blood on it.\\u201d\", \"There will be an allocation hearing to determine the distribution of the settlement between Ms. McClain and Mr. McClain\\u2019s biological father, LaWayne Mosley.\", \"On Aug. 24, 2019, police received a 911 call in which the caller said that Mr. McClain, who was walking home from a convenience store, \\u201clooked sketchy\\u201d and was wearing a ski mask and waving his arms.\", \"The police arrived and restrained Mr. McClain, pulling him to the ground and subduing him with a \\u201ccarotid hold,\\u201d which restricts blood to the brain. Mr. McClain had told the officers he was simply walking home, according to an independent review. \\u201cI\\u2019m an introvert and I\\u2019m different,\\u201d he said during the confrontation, according to audio recordings from the stop. \\u201cI\\u2019m just different,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThat\\u2019s all. That\\u2019s all I was doing. I\\u2019m so sorry.\\u201d\", \"While being restrained, Mr. McLain told the officers he couldn\\u2019t breathe, and he vomited, according to the review. When paramedics arrived about 15 minutes later, they injected him with ketamine, a powerful sedative. Mr. McClain went into cardiac arrest on the way to a hospital and died a few days later.\", \"Mr. McClain\\u2019s parents filed the lawsuit for damages on Aug. 11, 2020, which named the city of Aurora, 12 police officers, two Fire Department paramedics and the department\\u2019s medical director as defendants.\", \"\\u201cIn a span of 18 minutes, defendants subjected Elijah to a procession of needless and brutal force techniques and unnecessary, recklessly administered medication, the combined effects of which he could not survive,\\u201d the lawsuit said.\", \"Unrelated to the lawsuit, a Colorado grand jury indicted three police officers and two paramedics on charges including manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. No hearing dates have been set, according to Mr. Mohamedbhai.\", \"\\u201cThis tragedy has greatly changed and shaped Aurora,\\u201d said Jim Twombly, the Aurora city manager, in a statement Friday. \\u201cIn the two years since he died, we have taken a hard look at our policies, our biases and our need to listen to our community.\\u201d\", \"In 2020, Gov. Jared Polis signed a sweeping law enforcement reform bill that banned chokeholds and limited the use of deadly force. It also allows plaintiffs to bypass \\u201cqualified immunity,\\u201d a doctrine that can shield police misconduct from lawsuits seeking damages.\", \"Earlier this year, Governor Polis signed a bill that restricts the ability of emergency medical workers to administer ketamine.\", \"Following an investigation into policing in Aurora that found a pattern of racial bias and excessive force, the city reached an agreement with the state to make wide-ranging changes in policing policies and practices.\", \"\\u201cElijah, here in Colorado, was a lightning rod for social justice reform,\\u201d Mr. Mohamedbhai said.\", \"Mr. McClain was a massage therapist who loved animals and music, having taught himself to play the guitar and the violin.\", \"His family knew him for his drive and determination to improve his life, an energy that they say inspired those around him.\", \"Mr. McClain suffered from asthma as a child, Ms. McClain said. But through his perseverance, he became a strong runner.\", \"\\u201cTo be able to run down the streets for hours, for miles, that was something both of us, all of us were proud of,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe was accomplishing all of his obstacles, he was hurdling over those placements in his path, and he was clearing them.\\u201d\", \"Since her son\\u2019s death, Ms. McClain, who raised Mr. McClain as a single mother, with the two of them sometimes living in their car and sometimes in hotels and shelters, has played an instrumental role in pushing government officials to act on police reform.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve never seen such drive by a parent to just really try to move our communities forward and to bring meaning to Elijah\\u2019s senseless death,\\u201d Mr. Mohamedbhai said. \\u201cIt really goes to show his light and grace and beauty.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e9ead27e4a6f11eca61e93f302fdba14"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e9ead27e4a6f11eca61e93f302fdba14"}},
