And while HBO\\u2019s monumental passion-and-fashion comedy \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d was about getting \\u2014 getting success, getting rich, getting lucky \\u2014 \\u201cAnd Just Like That,\\u201d its later-life limited-series postscript, is riddled with loss.\", \"There are small losses, like the passing of Barneys (R.I.P.), the secular temple of the sex columnist and style maven Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker). There is the casting loss of Kim Cattrall, whose libidinous Samantha has been shuffled off to London. There are heartbreaking losses of people, both fictional and real-life.\", \"But when you are continuing a series that from 1998 to 2004 kept its finger on \\u2014 to keep this PG, I\\u2019ll say \\u201cthe pulse\\u201d \\u2014 of upscale Manhattan\\u2019s sexual and social mores, there is also the fatal danger of losing your touch.\", \"And there you have \\u201cAnd Just Like That.\\u201d Its first four episodes (of 10) feel like two shows. One, which tries to grow with the women as they navigate their 50s and mortality, is a downer, but it takes risks and in moments is very good. The other, which tries to update its sassy turn-of-the-century sensibility for an era of diversity, is painful.\", \"The two-episode premiere, streaming now on HBO Max, finds Carrie, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) still lunching after all these years. The city is still alluring. The sex is more peripheral.\", \"Carrie is now the \\u201ccisgender woman\\u201d on a podcast whose younger co-hosts make her feel like a fuddy-duddy. For Charlotte, intimacy is when her husband, Harry (Evan Handler), pees while she\\u2019s on the phone in the bathroom. The only one getting it on in Miranda\\u2019s household is her teenage son, whose prophylactics she\\u2019s finding on his bedroom floor.\", \"\\u201cAt least he\\u2019s using protection,\\u201d Charlotte offers. \\u201cNow that is seeing the condom as half-full,\\u201d Carrie answers. It\\u2019s a classic exchange; close your eyes, and it could be 1998 again.\", \"\\u201cAnd Just Like That\\u201d gets a lot of early mileage out of nostalgia. (There\\u2019s also the bittersweetness of seeing Willie Garson, who died during production, return as Carrie\\u2019s best gay friend, Stanford Blatch, though his character seems to be written off in a rush at the end of the fourth episode.) The warm feelings are capped by the sight of Carrie at home with her shoe closet and her other true love, Big (Chris Noth).\", \"But if you were expecting a frothy cocktail to take your mind off the world\\u2019s troubles, the premiere throws that drink in your face. Here is your last warning if you care about spoilers: Big dies of a heart attack after a workout, in Peloton\\u2019s most unfortunate product placement.\", \"And just like that, \\u201cAnd Just Like That\\u201d becomes an after-happily-ever-after story.\", \"The second episode, set largely at Big\\u2019s funeral, is oddly paced and grim without quite managing catharsis. But at least it\\u2019s unexpected, in an era of TV revivals that pander to give their audiences more of what they already like. Maybe this could also be the funeral for \\u201cSex and the City,\\u201d after six seasons and two movies, and the start of something new.\", \"It is \\u2014 a little. The original series was deft at unpacking emotional mess, and Parker brings Carrie new gravity as she deals with her unexpected anger, jealousy and sense of unmooring. The show\\u2019s tone changes to match; gone are the wry, punny voice-overs as Carrie gazes at her laptop and muses, \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t help but wonder \\u2026\\u201d\", \"But much of the rest of the series relies on a kind of cultural time-travel comedy: What do you get if you reboot \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d into the social and TV culture of 2021? Here, things get cringey, fast.\", \"The original series was groundbreaking for its sexual frankness and complex female friendships. It was also, like much TV of its time, very straight and very white. The series finale of \\u201cPose,\\u201d set in the late 1990s, points it out when Elektra (Dominique Jackson), the Black transgender matriarch of the ballroom scene, surveys a room of wannabe Carries downing cosmopolitans: \\u201cI refuse to let some TV show about white girls define how we eat, drink and gather as girlfriends.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAnd Just Like That\\u201d wants to address this history and have its cancel-culture jokes, too. Miranda, returning to school for a master\\u2019s degree, spends her first day of class nervously dropping microaggressions while her younger classmates glower at her. Later, she says that class is going fine \\u201cnow that I know everyone\\u2019s pronouns.\\u201d There\\u2019s a bit of an Unfrozen 1990s Caveperson vibe to it all.\", \"Each central character gets a friend or colleague of color as a sounding board. Miranda befriends her Black professor, Nya (Karen Pittman); Charlotte bonds with Lisa (Nicole Ari Parker), a Black fellow power mom from her kids\\u2019 school; Carrie does her podcast with Che (Sara Ramirez), a \\u201cqueer nonbinary Mexican-Irish diva,\\u201d and engages a high-powered real estate agent, Seema (Sarita Choudhury), who has Samantha\\u2019s brass with a Hindi name.\", \"All of these new characters could, in theory, be well-developed people with their own problems and inner lives; Che is especially well-drawn in quick strokes. But they don\\u2019t yet pass the racial Bechdel test; they exist only in relation to the central trio, serving to challenge or affirm them while reassuring them and us that they\\u2019re trying hard and mean well. The whole production feels as if it speed-read \\u201cHow to Be an Antiracist\\u201d in June 2020.\", \"Zeitgeisty shows like \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d often get dinged for not \\u201caging well.\\u201d But they\\u2019re not meant to; they\\u2019re fresh-cut pieces of sashimi. That\\u2019s an art with little margin for error, and too often, \\u201cAnd Just Like That\\u201d is already off by the time it hits the plate. (See also the unfortunate jokes describing the pandemic in the past tense.)\", \"That said, it is trying. Certainly it\\u2019s more enlightened and much better than the Birkin bag of luxury goods and orientalism that was \\u201cSex and the City 2.\\u201d And even in today\\u2019s bigger TV universe, ensemble comedies about women in their mid-50s are not exactly common.\", \"But if its makers, like the returning executive producer Michael Patrick King, are concerned with the \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d legacy, that\\u2019s already secure. You see it in a line of series about sexually and professionally empowered women, in female-friend quadrumvirates from \\u201cGirlfriends\\u201d to \\u201cGirls.\\u201d\", \"One of those, as it happens, just ended a terrific first season on HBO Max: \\u201cThe Sex Lives of College Girls,\\u201d from Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, follows four roommates at a private college in Vermont through various comings of age. It\\u2019s a smart, tart look at campus culture wars and sexual misadventures that is timely, diverse and class-conscious without feeling forced. The first season flies by, and the series has just been renewed for a second.\", \"Maybe a better way to get that old feeling back is by discovering a new show. \\u201cAnd Just Like That\\u201d may offer die-hard fans the closure that the movies didn\\u2019t \\u2014 if it doesn\\u2019t bum them out. But as I finished my screeners and hunched over my own laptop, I couldn\\u2019t help but wonder: Was this really necessary?\"]","href_hash":"804c668e591f11eca11b5db6e1401761"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"804c668e591f11eca11b5db6e1401761"}},
