You know what\\u2019s really going on here,\\u201d she said in her closing argument. \\u201cMr. Arbery was under attack.\\u201d\", \"She added: \\u201cThey shot and killed him, not because he was a threat to them, but because he wouldn\\u2019t stop and talk to them. And they were going to make him \\u2014 absolutely make him \\u2014 stop. \\u2018We\\u2019re going to point a shotgun at you! That will make him stop.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Mr. Arbery was inside a partially built house on Feb. 23, 2020, in the defendants\\u2019 neighborhood. After a neighbor saw him and called police, Mr. Arbery left the house and began running. It was at that point that Gregory McMichael, Travis McMichael\\u2019s father, saw Mr. Arbery and called to his son, and the two men began chasing Mr. Arbery in a pickup truck. Mr. Bryan, a neighbor, soon also began chasing Mr. Arbery.\", \"The men have said that they were trying to detain Mr. Arbery as part of a legal citizen\\u2019s arrest. But Ms. Dunikoski said that Georgia law called for a person to be in the presence of a crime being committed, or have \\u201cimmediate knowledge\\u201d that a crime was committed, to perform such an arrest. The law also says that a person can make such an arrest if a felony has been committed and a suspect is \\u201cescaping or attempting to escape,\\u201d but the arresting person must have \\u201creasonable and probable grounds\\u201d of suspicion.\", \"Ms. Dunikoski said the three men never saw Mr. Arbery inside the partly built house on the day of the incident. At most, she said, Mr. Arbery had committed the misdemeanor of trespassing. There is no evidence that Mr. Arbery had ever taken anything from the house, which he had visited numerous times before.\", \"\\u201cIs he this giant burglar who just happened to never show up with a bag, or any means to steal anything, all right, or is he a looky-loo?\\u201d she said.\", \"Without a legal justification to detain Mr. Arbery, Ms. Dunikoski said, the men were essentially committing crimes against him.\", \"She walked the jury through the charges \\u2014 including false imprisonment, aggravated assault, felony murder and malice murder. She mentioned details that emerged in testimony about the way the three men in two pickup trucks had chased Mr. Arbery, who ran from them on foot. She noted that Mr. Bryan had tried numerous times to use his car to stop Mr. Arbery, at one point running him off the road into a ditch. She mentioned that Gregory McMichael had told investigators that Mr. Arbery had been trapped \\u201clike a rat\\u201d after he was hemmed in by the two trucks.\", \"She also walked the jury through aspects of the law that she said made all three men culpable in crimes including murder, even though only one of them had pulled the trigger. She compared their acts to those of a football team working together to win.\", \"\\u201cEverybody gets a Super Bowl ring,\\u201d she said.\", \"Ms. Dunikoski\\u2019s presentation lasted roughly an hour. She suggested that she would exercise her right to speak a second time after the defense made its closing arguments.\"]","href_hash":"2892a64c4bc311eca0b7b16c2ab54695"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2892a64c4bc311eca0b7b16c2ab54695"}},
