It was timed and choreographed to perfection. It was ballet on grass.\", \"It was also the moment that, ultimately, turned the game.\", \"Following the tackle, Wheeler fed the ball to an exhausted Steph Catley, who clipped a cross in for Sam Kerr to control and lay off for the coiling Kyah Simon.\\u00a0Simon, seething at having missed a sitter in the first friendly on Saturday, lashed at the ball, which deflected off the leg of USA defender Becky Sauerbrunn and flew into the back of the net.\", \"\\\"Sometimes that isn't credited enough,\\\" a relieved Gustavsson said of Wheeler's efforts\\u00a0afterwards. \\\"You see the goal-scorer \\u2014\\u00a0and obviously it was brilliant that Kyah stepped back and scored because she missed that chance [in game one] \\u2014\\u00a0but the key to that goal is Clare Wheeler's tackle.\", \"\\\"We said we need to be more physical, win our fight plan \\u2013 our one-on-one duels \\u2013 and Clare was the game changer that came in with that mindset.

It is a position as necessary as it is under-appreciated: the omnipresent, metronomic central player who is often the glue that holds the forward and back lines together.\", \"Since the Olympics, Gustavsson has plugged the gap with two capable midfielders in Emily Van Egmond and Kyra Cooney-Cross.\", \"But these are two players whose careers to date have been built on their attacking qualities: Van Egmond's vision to find space and unlock defences with key passes, Cooney-Cross's shooting technique and frightening acceleration when moving forward with the ball.\", \"Against the USA on Tuesday night, both midfielders were part of the starting XI, with Van Egmond playing the deeper-lying role. However, perhaps also through a combination of fatigue and the energy-sapping humidity of Newcastle, the midfield looked at times tired and disjointed.\\u00a0Passes didn't connect, support triangles were too slow to form\\u00a0and the energy in one-on-one challenges was lacklustre.\", \"Or it was, until Wheeler \\u2014\\u00a0the only clearly identifiable defensive midfielder in the squad \\u2014\\u00a0came on in the 86th minute.\", \"\\\"I need to look at the game [again to see] if it was the right time.\", \"\\\"Maybe it was the right time because we've got the effect of it and we scored.\", \"\\\"Would it have been even more effective if I did it earlier? I need to look at the momentum of the game.\", \"\\\"One of the reasons why I didn't change is I felt we had a momentum going [\\u2026] I felt that we were playing good, we had advantage.

If he does not time things perfectly, he cannot achieve the goals that have been set out by and for him.\", \"This USA friendly series is the last time we'll see the Matildas before they travel to India to play \\u2014\\u00a0and, according to Gustavsson, seriously challenge for \\u2014 the Asian Cup,\\u00a0a trophy they first won over a decade ago but have fallen agonisingly short of lifting again ever since.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b1ba68f75d87b5db2d8e631f5744749f\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The Matildas were left disappointed with an Asian Cup final loss to Japan in 2018.
