This is a good time to show the world our culture.\\u201d\", \"That culture, and the almost warp-speed with which Qatar has embraced art and modernity in the last few decades, is evident in not only Mr. al-Malik\\u2019s journey to Miami but also in the works of several other prominent Qatari artists. Like him, they have had the opportunity to bring their art to the United States as part of Jedariart, a public art initiative. The visiting artist program is part of the Qatar-USA 2021 Year of Culture.\", \"Jedariart had hoped to be connected to the Art Basel event in Miami Beach, given its prominence and high attendance. The other Jedariart artists in this year\\u2019s program were: Fatima al-Sharshani, who painted in Portland, Ore.; Mubarak al-Thani, in San Francisco; Nada Khozestani, in Jersey City, N.J.; and Muna al-Bader, in Houston.\", \"But Mr. al-Malik will have his work in the spotlight, right in Wynwood, a former warehouse district that is now a hub of art and culture. And his work will stay there for a full year alongside other wall paintings in the neighborhood known as a magnet for muralists.\", \"Mr. al-Malik said he intended to paint in the same style \\u2014 and with the same subject matter. Most of his murals (he\\u2019s done about 40) were created on crumbling ruins in Qatar\\u2019s desert, as well as on low-slung, and often abandoned, buildings in Doha and other cities.\", \"Many of them depict the batoola in colorful and almost cartoonish ways. It\\u2019s a whimsical way for Mr. al-Malik to portray the rich history of the Bedouin women on this peninsula on the Persian Gulf \\u2014 a history that many outside the region may know little about.\", \"Much of Mr. al-Malik\\u2019s affection for the head covering stems from his relationships with family members \\u2014 particularly with his grandmother, who has worn batoolas for decades. Now in her 80s, she has been the inspiration for much of his artwork, he said.\", \"He acknowledges that the coverings are often misunderstood outside of the Muslim world. But for him, the batoola is the perfect vehicle to celebrate Qatari life at home and abroad, and show its complexity, from the rustic to the contemporary. Traditional and a bit mysterious, it is now a fashion accessory for many modern women in this almost dizzyingly wealthy country.\", \"\\u201cIn my artwork, I try to show my culture, and if someone asks about something they don\\u2019t understand, I will explain,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI show them why I love my culture and my country.\\u201d\", \"Abdulrahman al-Ishaq, director of public art at Qatar Museums, a consortium of museums across the small country, said Mr. al-Malik has chosen an apt symbol.\", \"\\u201cTo the people of the Gulf, the batoola is a symbol of maternal compassion, care-taking and generosity,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNon-Muslims or those unfamiliar to our regional traditions see it through the frame of political agendas, which is unfortunate. Mubarak is probing viewers\\u2019 curiosity, asking them to question the face covering and then to understand it beyond its superficial stereotype.\\u201d\", \"The batoola\\u2019s origin is unclear, but it has been worn for several centuries to express modesty and sometimes marital status in Islam, as well as to protect from the wind and deflect the harsh desert sun. Usually made from goat leather or heavy fabric, it is painted in gold or silver, giving it a shiny texture that is often mistaken for metal.\", \"The batoolas\\u2019 shape and design vary widely among countries, including a mostly full-face covering with a cage-like design and one that covers the eyebrows and runs down the center of the nose, resembling a falcon\\u2019s beak.\", \"For Mr. al-Malik, the many shapes and sizes provide him with a versatile image to work into his art, as well as a variety of faces that he often portrays up close and large on his murals.\", \"\\u201cIn my travels over the years, I saw graffiti art and how it can express a culture, and I asked myself, \\u2018Why don\\u2019t we have this in Qatar,\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cStreet art was not big in Doha until about 15 years ago, but now it\\u2019s everywhere. It\\u2019s not just in galleries and museums anymore.\\u201d\", \"Mr. al-Malik also works in painting and sculpture and studied art at Doha\\u2019s Youth Art Center. He has represented Qatar in several international exhibitions, and he has also painted murals in Rio de Janeiro, Moscow, London and Bahrain.\", \"His mural during Art Basel Miami Beach, which is still untitled, will be approximately 20 feet high by 40 feet wide, he said. He plans to complete it in about eight days starting Wednesday, although some of his similarly sized murals have taken just four to five days.\", \"\\u201cI want to not rush this one,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI want to enjoy.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e356fc27503411ecb8ac430814490bde"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e356fc27503411ecb8ac430814490bde"}},
