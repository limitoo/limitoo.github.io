The crime is defined as attempting \\\"to overthrow, put down or to destroy by force the government of the United States.\\\"\", \"Supporters of former President Donald Trump that day stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to stop Congress from certifying his election loss to President Joe Biden.\", \"The attack occurred shortly after Trump in a speech repeated his false claims that his loss was the result of widespread voting fraud and urged his supporters to go to the Capitol and \\\"fight like hell\\\" to stop the election from being stolen.\", \"The far-right Oath Keepers militia are a loosely organised group of activists who believe that the federal government is encroaching on their rights, and focus on recruiting current and former police, emergency services and military members.\", \"Prosecutors said that beginning in late December 2020, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes used private encrypted communications to plan to travel to Washington on 6 January.

Fourteen alleged members or supporters were indicted, with 10 facing seditious conspiracy counts.\", \"After a two-month trial, a jury acquitted all defendants.\", \"-Reuters\"]","href_hash":"87355ae274d011ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"87355ae274d011ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
