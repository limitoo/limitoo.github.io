So somebody who has got a 50 litre tank, they will save $14.37 on that tank and that's a fairly substantial saving,\\\" Collins said.\", \"\\\"What we're also very pleased about is given that we need so much work done on our roading, that the decision to reduce the fuel excise duty will not impact on the national and transport fund, so that means our roading projects and maintenance can continue unimpeded, and for that that's good news.\\\"\", \"Prices could continue to fluctuate but there was still the ability to readjust the decision depending on the circumstances, he said.\", \"\\\"I think the prices we're getting - we're starting to see some stability come back into the market. What I'm seeing now is prices stabilising around anywhere between $109 and $113 a barrel and they're relatively small fluctuations whereas a week earlier we were seeing 13 percent increases, 10 percent reductions, massive ups and downs.\\\"\", \"Hospitality New Zealand also welcomed the reduction in excise duty on petrol, coming at a time of \\\"a cost-of-living crisis\\\", as well as the public transport fare cuts.\", \"In a statement, chief executive Julie White said with fuel prices expected to continue climbing and food prices increasing, businesses would require even more relief soon.\", \"\\\"Hospitality and accommodation businesses simply cannot absorb the additional costs caused by petrol price hikes on top of those food increases as they continue to struggle as a result of the Covid downturn.\", \"\\\"Unfortunately, they will still have to put prices up, and that will hurt consumers and keep more of them away.
