And again, this is an order that is for the entire country, including our private businesses.\\\"\", \"ACT Party leader David Seymour said the government should not have taken tests that would otherwise have gone to the private sector.\", \"He said the situation was similar to the start of the pandemic, when personal protective equipment was in short supply and medical staff were forced to work without adequate PPE.\", \"\\\"The government does not have its own supplies, and it's now discouraging anyone else from bringing them in. We'll remember in the early stages of the pandemic we were saved by private businesses going all out to bring planeloads of PPE from China.\\\"\", \"Seymour said the government should not be the distributor of supplies.\", \"Bloomfield said the ministry would engage with businesses whose rapid antigen testing orders were delayed as a result of the incident.\", \"RNZ\"]","href_hash":"7d5ae4e67ecc11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7d5ae4e67ecc11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
