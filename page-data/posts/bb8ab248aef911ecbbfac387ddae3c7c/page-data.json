Sunday night's report said Scavino was first issued a subpoena at Mar-a-Lago, but the committee had to issue a second subpoena in October after the first one was challenged.\\u00a0\", \"The committee is seeking information from Scavino because, according to Sunday's report, he was \\\"reportedly present for meetings in November 2020 where then-President Trump consulted with outside advisors about ways to challenge the results of the 2020 election\\\" and because they have \\\"reason to believe that Mr. Scavino was with then-President Trump on January 5 and January 6 and was party to conversations regarding plans to challenge, disrupt, or impede the official congressional proceedings.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"The committee said Trump and Scavino spoke multiple times by phone on January 6 and alleged that Scavino might have had advance warning of the violence because he monitored websites where the assault was discussed.

None of the official responsibilities of Mr. Navarro's positions included advising President Trump about the 2020 Presidential election or the roles and responsibilities of Congress and the Vice President during the January 6, 2021, joint session of Congress.\\\"\", \"The committee in February issued a subpoena to Navarro, who served as a trade adviser to Trump, alleging he developed plans to change the outcome of the election. Rather than reply to the subpoena, the report said Navarro, \\\"predicted that his interactions with the Select Committee would be judged by the 'Supreme Court, where this case is headed.'\\\"\", \"According to Sunday's report, Navarro worked with \\\"Bannon and others to develop and implement a plan to delay Congress' certification and ultimately change the outcome of the November 2020 Presidential election.\\\"\", \"The report also said that Navarro detailed in his November 2021 book \\\"In Trump Time\\\" this plan, called the \\\"Green Bay Sweep.\\\" Navarro called this \\\"the last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from Democrats' jaws of deceit.\\\" In a later interview about the book, Navarro said Trump was \\\"on board with the strategy.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"The January 6 Select Committee has already formally recommended the U.S. House formally refer Bannon and Meadows for contempt of Congress prosecution.
