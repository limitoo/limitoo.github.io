In reality, the suitcases were standard ballot holding containers, and that the votes were all legitimate.\", \"Forensic audits, including some from former Trump officials, have continued to find no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.\", \"Freeman stated that she called 911 after Kutti showed up at her suburban Atlanta house in January 2021, claiming that she was sent by an unnamed \\\"high-profile individual.\\\" Kutti then told Freeman that she had two days to confess to election fraud or she would be sent to jail.\", \"The back-and-forth encounter eventually led to the women agreeing to have a conversation at the police station. Police bodycam footage obtained by Reuters captured a portion of their talk.\", \"Kutti can be heard telling Freeman that she \\\"didn't want to frighten you, but we had to find you within this timeframe.\\\"\", \"After this exchange, Kutti appears to allude to Freeman and her family being in danger if she did not confess to voter fraud.
