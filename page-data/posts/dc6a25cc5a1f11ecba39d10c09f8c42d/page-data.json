But in Salzburg, where the surge has been sharp, there are plans for a brighter future.\", \"On Friday the Salzburg Festival, classical music and opera\\u2019s most storied annual event, announced its 2022 summer season \\u2014 back to prepandemic scale, with more than 200 events over six weeks beginning July 18.\", \"A double bill of Bartok\\u2019s \\u201cBluebeard\\u2019s Castle\\u201d and Orff\\u2019s rarely performed \\u201cDe Temporum Fine Comoedia\\u201d will be staged by Romeo Castellucci and conducted by Teodor Currentzis.

There is a rich lineup of spoken drama, orchestra concerts \\u2014 many featuring the festival\\u2019s house band, the Vienna Philharmonic \\u2014 and recitals, including the usual enviable array of pianists.\", \"The season will be the first under Kristina Hammer, the festival\\u2019s ne-w president, whose appointment was announced on Nov. 24. A marketing and communications specialist, Hammer follows Helga Rabl-Stadler\\u2019s quarter-century tenure, and she joins Markus Hinterh\\u00e4user, the artistic director, and Lukas Crepaz, the finance director, in a triumvirate that will continue to negotiate the pandemic, as well as oversee a major renovation of the festival\\u2019s theaters.\", \"Hammer\\u2019s appointment \\u201cis a conscious step taken by the board in order to further internationalize the Salzburg Festival,\\u201d Wilfried Haslauer Jr., the region\\u2019s governor, said in a statement.\", \"Buoyed by government subsidies and sponsorship deals, Salzburg has been able to weather the pandemic, putting on a fairly robust season in 2020 for limited audiences and returning to something akin to normal in 2021. The commemoration of the centennial of the festival, which was established in 1920, ended up being spread over the past two years.\", \"The Overture Spirituelle, a week or so of events originally instituted to draw audiences in the quiet period before the operas are running in earnest, comes into its own next summer as truly \\u201ca festival in the festival,\\u201d Hinterh\\u00e4user said in an interview.\", \"Some distinguished Overture ensembles include Currentzis\\u2019s MusicAeterna; Klangforum Wien; John Eliot Gardiner\\u2019s Monteverdi Choir and English Baroque Soloists; the Tallis Scholars; and \\u201cMessiah\\u201d forces led by Jordi Savall.
