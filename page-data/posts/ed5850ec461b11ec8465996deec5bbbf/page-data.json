Ka Mate dates back to 1820 and recounts the story of the heroic escape of Te Rauparaha, a chieftain, from capture by a rival tribe. Ngati Toa has previously spoken out against its misuse for commercial gain.\", \"Historically, pandemics have posed a particular threat to Maori, New Zealand\\u2019s Indigenous people. The 1918 flu pandemic devastated Maori communities, killing Maori at a rate seven times that of the wider population, while in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the rate of infection for Maori was twice that of white New Zealanders.\", \"The present coronavirus pandemic has again hit Maori disproportionately. As of March, half of those in New Zealand who had ended up in intensive care because of the virus had been Maori, despite their making up only 14 percent of the population. The vaccination rate among Maori lags behind the rest of the country, with 77 percent of those eligible having received at least one dose of a vaccine, compared to 90 percent in the wider population.\", \"In light of this history, and of the ancestors they have lost to these illnesses, the tribe has taken a proactive role in vaccinating its members against the coronavirus, said Helmut Modlik, a senior member of Ngati Toa.\", \"\\u201cWe are absolutely clear that the Covid-19 vaccine is the best protection we have available to us, and we are committed to supporting our wh\\u0101nau to get vaccinated as soon as possible,\\u201d Dr. Modlik added. He called for protesters to use a different haka, of which there are many.\"]","href_hash":"ed5850ec461b11ec8465996deec5bbbf"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ed5850ec461b11ec8465996deec5bbbf"}},
