You could bounce a quarter off it \\u2014 or given its provenance, a five-afghani coin \\u2014 and then throw yourself down to recover your nerves, which the drama will have absolutely mangled.\", \"The time is 2013, 12 years after the beginning of America\\u2019s \\u201cforever war\\u201d in Afghanistan, eight years before its unceremonious close and a moment in which the United States has radically reduced its troop presence. The setting, by Arnulfo Maldonado, is the nice enough Kabul apartment where Afiya (Marjan Neshat) lives with her husband, Jawid (Mattico David), a tailor and storekeeper. For months they have shared the apartment with a third roommate, Taroon (Dario Ladani Sanchez), Afiya\\u2019s brother, who spends many of his waking hours in the living room closet.\", \"At some point in the past, Taroon worked as a translator for the American forces, which has made him a target of the Taliban. Separated from his pregnant wife, he passes his days surreptitiously watching television and checking the status of his special immigrant visa \\u2014 when the Wi-Fi works, anyway. As the play begins, Taroon\\u2019s wife is in labor and he must weigh the risk of seeing her.\", \"As directed by Tyne Rafaeli, \\u201cSelling Kabul\\u201d has elements of a Greek tragedy and an espionage thriller. As a suspense story that unrolls in real time, it also suggests stage chillers like \\u201cRope.\\u201d Khoury has built her play like a puzzle box. Every detail of the wordless opening moments, even the offstage noises \\u2014 a baby crying, an engine revving \\u2014 will reverberate later on. (This is the rare play in which the sound design, by Lee Kinney, is absolutely crucial to the story.) Pay particular attention to the opening conversation between Afiya and Taroon, a tangle of truth and lies in which each word matters.\", \"A structural marvel, \\u201cSelling Kabul\\u201d can sometimes sound a little hollow at its core. Khoury sketches personalities for the characters \\u2014 rounded out by Francis Benhamou as Leyla, a chatterbox neighbor \\u2014 quickly and deftly. We immediately understand Taroon\\u2019s impetuousness, Jawid\\u2019s equivocation, Leyla\\u2019s bright anguish, Afiya\\u2019s fretful good sense. (Afiya is the play\\u2019s moral center; Neshat is its standout.) But these people mainly serve as devices to urge the drama toward crisis and their speech can seem stilted, as when Taroon reacts to the birth of his son: \\u201cHe\\u2019ll think me a coward. Too scared to show my face in the light of day.\\u201d\", \"This would matter less in another play, located in an environment more familiar to American audiences, or if we had more plays, particularly plays by writers of Middle Eastern descent, set in this region. But we don\\u2019t have many. In terms of what has played in New York, only \\u201cHomebody/Kabul,\\u201d \\u201cBlood and Gifts\\u201d and \\u201cThe Great Game: Afghanistan\\u201d come to mind, works by white British and American writers. At its best, theater can bring the faraway very close, personalize the abstract.\", \"Acknowledging that too few of us stateside will ever understand the civilian toll of conflicts like those in Afghanistan, I wish Khoury, a playwright of French and Lebanese descent, and Rafaeli had done more to make these characters feel fully human and not just wheels in a beautiful machine. Or maybe this is simply my own regret talking \\u2014 my memory of seeing the images of the chaos at Kabul airport during America\\u2019s botched August exit and realizing that I should have been paying a lot more attention. But that\\u2019s the thing about a forever war waged a world away: I didn\\u2019t have to. It\\u2019s unfair to want \\u201cSelling Kabul\\u201d to have made me.\", \"So enjoy the play instead as a nimble entertainment and a first-rate workout for your sympathetic nervous system \\u2014 if I still bit my nails I would have no nails left now. And appreciate, too, that while \\u201cSelling Kabul\\u201d could have ended tragically, it instead offers some morsel of hope to all of its characters, even if it perverts reason to keep that hope alive. (Honestly, there are a few other logical discrepancies, as when fastidious characters suddenly leave the door open. But when you\\u2019re tempted to yell, \\u201cFor the love of all that\\u2019s holy, lock the door!\\u201d at the stage, clearly a play has got you.)\", \"After the lights come back on, you will find an insert in your program with information about the International Refugee Assistance Project, a charity that offers legal aid to people in Taroon\\u2019s situation, a way to make that hope more real. Maybe that\\u2019s a test of a play, not how well it works within a theater\\u2019s narrow walls, but how much it makes you want to act beyond them.\"]","href_hash":"a0fca536570511ec9e0d41dc170e21bc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a0fca536570511ec9e0d41dc170e21bc"}},
