They would also get $137 for M\\u0101ori and Pacific students, or $329 if they were studying for a level 7 diploma.\", \"Some of the learner component would be allocated only if institutions reached performance measures such as particular pass rates.\", \"The third component, called the Strategic Component, would be used to meet regional skill needs and to pay for the development and maintenance of qualifications.\"]","href_hash":"82d3fa1d86e111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"82d3fa1d86e111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
