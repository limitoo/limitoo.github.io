So after all the big, celebratory holiday dinners this week, and after several days of happily eating leftover pie for breakfast, it\\u2019ll be time for \\u2026 a big pot of khichdi.\", \"I usually make it with basmati rice and split moong dal, but khichdi (also called huggi, pongal, pulagam, and other names across India) can be made with other grains, and other lentils, too. Samantha Seneviratne makes her stewlike khichdi in an electric pressure cooker with a little tomato, onion and ginger, and here\\u2019s how to make another simple version that I love, which I affectionately refer to as \\u201cbaby khichdi\\u201d because the seasoning is so gentle:\", \"In a Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed pot with a fitted lid, mix 1 cup long-grain white rice and 1 cup split yellow moong dal (also labeled split mung beans). Rinse with cold water, and tip out the water several times, until it runs almost clear. Add about 10 cups fresh water, 1 heaped teaspoon fine sea salt, \\u00bd teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon chile powder, 2 teaspoons garam masala and 6 tablespoons ghee or butter. Over high heat, bring up to a boil, then stir well, turn the heat down to low and cover. After about 20 minutes, taste the rice and moong for tenderness and to adjust seasoning.\", \"If you want a drier final product, more like a pulao, you can leave the lid off and let some of the extra liquid evaporate for a few minutes. If you want it soupier, more like a porridge, add a splash of water. Otherwise, just give it a gentle stir and turn off the heat. Serve as is, or with a drizzle of ghee and some yogurt on the side.\", \"If it\\u2019s not khichdi, I hope you\\u2019re cooking whatever makes you feel good after the stress of the holiday. And if you\\u2019re looking for more one-pot recipes with similar vibes, take a look at Melissa Clark\\u2019s mujadara with leeks and greens, and Ali Slagle\\u2019s rice and beans.\", \"Go to the recipe.\", \"Go to the recipe.\", \"Go to the recipe.\", \"I wanted to point you toward several more khichdi techniques to really give you a sense of its breadth.\", \"You can cook this one from Two Sleevers in the Instant Pot using short-grain rice and almost any split lentil, while Khushbu Shah\\u2019s version is finished in the oven. This khichdi from Saffron Trail uses pearl millet (soaked beforehand), and this one from Manjula\\u2019s Kitchen is seasoned with a delicious fried tomato mixture.\", \"Thanks for reading the Veggie and see you next week!
