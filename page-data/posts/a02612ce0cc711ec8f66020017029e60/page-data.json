As soon as the Taliban swept, with surprising speed, into Kabul last month, Afghans knew what to do during Taliban rule 2.0.

The first to go was an image, starkly painted in black and white, to mark the signing of a deal last year in Doha between the Taliban and the United States. \", \"A people of poets now struggles to find words.  \", \"An old friend, Masood Khalili, who's fought on so many fronts over so many years, sends me some verse.  \", \"\\\"Last night the Writer of Fate whispered in my ear, Our Book of Destiny is filled with smiles and tears.\\\" \"]","href_hash":"a02612ce0cc711ec8f66020017029e60"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a02612ce0cc711ec8f66020017029e60"}},
