But his call for reborn glory for France is sharply at odds with the realities of the country today.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-04T13:28:37.000Z","content":"[\"PARIS \\u2014 The retro choreography was heavy-handed, its intent obvious: \\u00c9ric Zemmour in a dark tie, eyes averted from the camera, reading into an old-fashioned microphone from sheets of paper, just like Charles de Gaulle in his famous speech from London on June 18, 1940, when he called for the liberation of a fallen France.\", \"Mr. Zemmour is not a towering general, and France is not on its knees. But Mr. Zemmour, the far-right polemicist who this week announced his run for next year\\u2019s presidential election, understands the power of provocative imagery. Effrontery and scandal have propelled his outsider candidacy.\", \"His campaign-launching video was a nationalistic call for reborn French glory. From Joan of Arc to the singer Johnny Hallyday, from Napoleon Bonaparte to Brigitte Bardot, from Voltaire to Versailles, from Notre Dame to village church bells, it took viewers on a tour of Mr. Zemmour\\u2019s imaginary France.\", \"The France that \\u2014 in the telling of this Jewish journalist of North African descent whose family arrived in France 70 years ago \\u2014 existed before immigrants, Muslim veils, vandalism and mealy-mouthed elites led the country to its most recent strange defeat.\", \"\\u201cHis catastrophic vision speaks to a deep-rooted French pessimism,\\u201d said Pascal Perrineau, a social scientist. \\u201cWe are one of the most pessimistic countries in the world. Combine that with alienation from the political class, inward-looking nationalism, and a defiant French inclination to overturn the table, and you have the Zemmour phenomenon.\\u201d\", \"Whether or not Mr. Zemmour can build out from his current support \\u2014 in the 12 to 15 percent range, according to polls \\u2014 and qualify for the runoff round of voting in April is unclear. But one way or another, he will affect the outcome, splitting the far-right share of the vote and so opening up the field. Already this man without a party has illustrated just how far France has lurched to the right.\", \"There would be no Zemmour phenomenon if France were not ripe for it, just as there would have been no President Donald J. Trump if the United States had not been ready for his nationalist message.\", \"Mr. Zemmour explicitly models himself on Mr. Trump. He rose to notoriety through regular TV appearances, he laces his apocalyptic message with anti-immigrant slurs, he makes the unsayable sayable, he delights in a macho contempt for women, and his slogan might as well be \\u201cMake France Great Again.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe are a great nation, a great people. Our glorious past presages our future. Our soldiers conquered Europe and the world!\\u201d Mr. Zemmour declared this week, before insisting that \\u201cwe will be worthy of our ancestors. We will not allow ourselves to be dominated, turned into vassals, conquered, colonized. We will not allow ourselves to be replaced.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Zemmour, like Tucker Carlson of Fox News, is an ardent adherent to the theory of \\u201cthe great replacement,\\u201d a phrase generally attributed to a xenophobic French writer, Renaud Camus, who said: \\u201cThe great replacement is very simple. You have one people, and in the space of a generation, you have a different people.\\u201d The new France, according to Mr. Zemmour, would be the one that has been led to \\u201cdecline and decadence\\u201d by Muslim immigration.\", \"How did France arrive at this state, where polls suggest at least 35 percent of the population will vote for either Mr. Zemmour or the perennial candidate of the far right, Marine Le Pen, in the first round of voting?\", \"Some factors are shared with the United States \\u2014 cultural fracture between cities and the hinterland, deindustrialization, racial tensions, growing precariousness in the workplace \\u2014 but others are unique to France.\", \"Chief among them is the place of the second religion of France, Islam. Many of the millions of Muslims in France, as much as 10 percent of the population, according to estimates, are successfully integrated, but their story has tended to be overshadowed by numerous terrorist attacks by radical Islamists.\", \"This has engendered fear, as has the perception that the teachings of Islam may be hard to reconcile with a Republic dedicated to the notion that education dissolves differences of faith in shared citizenship.\", \"\\u201cImmigration equals Islam equals insecurity,\\u201d said Hakim El Karoui, a Muslim who is a senior fellow at the Institut Montaigne. \\u201cNo politician praises diversity any longer.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Zemmour\\u2019s emergence changes the presidential election, to be held a little over four months from now. Because Ms. Le Pen, the leader of the National Rally, who is making her third attempt to become president, and Mr. Zemmour, will divide the hard-right-right vote, it may open the way for a center-right candidate to reach the second round. The percentage of votes needed to qualify by being one of the top two candidates in the first round will be lower.\", \"Val\\u00e9rie P\\u00e9cresse, a moderate conservative who heads the \\u00cele-de-France regional council and is a former budget minister, looks almost certain to be picked this weekend as the candidate of the center-right Republicans. She has described herself as \\u201cone-third Thatcher, two-thirds Merkel\\u201d and is emerging as the potential dark horse of an election where the French left seems condemned to irrelevance.\", \"For now, President Emmanuel Macron, occupying a vast vacated middle ground, looks like the favorite. But he would be less comfortable facing Ms. P\\u00e9cresse in a runoff than an extreme right-wing ideologue.\", \"Mr. Zemmour, unlike Ms. Le Pen, has appealed to some of the center-right through his erudition and culture, but his challenge is now twofold: to convince the French that he is not a one-trick pony and to overcome the impression that he is not \\u201cpresidential.\\u201d In other words, he has to address issues beyond immigration, not least formulate something resembling an economic plan; and he probably needs to cut from his repertoire the kind of crude gesture he aimed at a protester in Marseille last month.\", \"Still, until now, as with Mr. Trump, every outrage that might have derailed Mr. Zemmour has left him reinforced, or at least still standing, and often leading the news of the day. An editorial in the center-right daily Le Figaro noted this week that it was a French writer, Honor\\u00e9 de Balzac, who described scandal as \\u201cthe pedestal of success.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Zemmour has called child asylum seekers \\u201cthieves, killers and rapists.\\u201d He has said \\u201cmost drug dealers are Black and Arab.\\u201d He has suggested France\\u2019s collaborationist wartime Vichy government saved French Jews. He has equated Jewish children murdered in 2012 with their jihadi terrorist killer because their parents chose to bury them outside France, in Jerusalem.\", \"He has argued that \\u201cIslam is incompatible with the French republic\\u201d and suggested that mass deportation of immigrants might not be impossible. This despite the fact an entire section of the cemetery at Verdun, the World War I battlefield where about 300,000 people were killed, is given over to Muslims who gave their lives for France.\", \"He would ban all \\u201cnon-French names\\u201d like Muhammad. He would rescind the 1972 Pleven law that made incitement to racial hatred illegal and has earned him repeated charges and one conviction.\", \"Mr. Zemmour\\u2019s 2006 book called \\u201cThe First Sex,\\u201d published when he was a journalist at Le Figaro newspaper, was a best seller. It argued that France had declined because of the loss of male \\u201cvirility\\u201d and the \\u201cfeminization\\u201d of society. In a subsequent best seller, \\u201cThe French Suicide,\\u201d published in 2014, he waxed lyrical about the world before feminism when a bus driver could \\u201cslide a concupiscent hand\\u201d over a woman\\u2019s backside without risking prosecution.\", \"Married to a lawyer, he is openly involved in a relationship with his political adviser Sarah Knafo, 28. He has not denied a news report that she is pregnant, although he has sued the magazine that published the article for invasion of privacy, according to his lawyers. The revelations have not caused a stir in France.\", \"\\u201cA lot of French people don\\u2019t care,\\u201d said Mr. Perrineau, the social scientist. \\u201cThey think some level of scandal is the price to be paid for renewing French political life.\\u201d\", \"De Gaulle said in his London speech that \\u201cthe flame of the French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished.\\u201d\", \"That, of course, was resistance to a France that had succumbed to the racist, antisemitic ideology of Vichy.\"]","href_hash":"eee9f002550511eca398e98360a85e45"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eee9f002550511eca398e98360a85e45"}},
