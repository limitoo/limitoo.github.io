We're a lot more urban, we're a lot more developed.\", \"\\\"So we're in a better and more developed state to really have these discussions and put the threshold at 4 metres - but that doesn't rule out outdoor living areas and outlooks being greater than that.\\\"\", \"Ogden-Cork says the extent of the changes counsels caution - she's seen where lax rules could lead to after a decade helping Auckland Council process hundreds of house building consents.\", \"\\\"I've spent 20 years arguing for intensification. We know how complex it is to do intensification properly.\", \"\\\"The general public need to realise, whatever concerns they have about Auckland unitary plan, they don't see the worst possible development because it doesn't get consent.\", \"\\\"What really concerns me is wh\\u0101nau well outside of the local leafy suburbs ... not having space to plant a tree outside their window.\\\"\", \"The bill aims to streamline the building of up to an extra 105,000 homes within eight years across most big cities and some of their surrounds such as in Waip\\u0101, Selwyn and western Bay of Plenty.\", \"Total home building is now forecast to hit 265,000 over the next six years, or 44,000 a year.\", \"Urban designer Emma McInnes, who chairs Women in Urbanism Aotearoa, says the country needs a mind shift.\", \"Dense housing designed around parks, playgrounds and shared gardens must take over from private patches of unused grass or concrete, she said.\", \"\\\"I've seen a few male politicians in particular talking about the need to design housing so that we can continue the culture of barbecue season in the summer.\", \"\\\"And I just think that's a wrong way to design housing in New Zealand.
