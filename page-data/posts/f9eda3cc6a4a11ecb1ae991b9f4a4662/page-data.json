None of that matters, because he knows \\u201cI got another film in the can, especially if I\\u2019m hopeful that it\\u2019s going to be good,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t care if it goes down. I\\u2019d feel bad for the other people, but me personally, I\\u2019m OK. I finished.\\u201d\", \"Collins, 51, has maintained such intense focus for more than 30 years as a character actor embellishing the ensembles of renowned directors like Steven Soderbergh (\\u201cTraffic\\u201d), Alejandro Gonz\\u00e1lez I\\u00f1\\u00e1rritu (\\u201cBabel\\u201d) and Quentin Tarantino (\\u201cOnce Upon a Time \\u2026 in Hollywood\\u201d), though you might know him better for scores of appearances on television series like \\u201cWestworld\\u201d and \\u201cBallers.\\u201d\", \"Now the actor is breaking through, finally, with a rare lead role. In Clint Bentley\\u2019s heartfelt indie, \\u201cJockey\\u201d (in theaters Dec. 29), Collins plays Jackson Silva, an aging horseman confronting physical ailments and potential fatherhood. The visceral performance, born of immersive preparation, has already earned him a best male lead nomination from the Independent Spirit Awards, a first for him, and a special acting prize at Sundance. It\\u2019s not his only role in a prominent picture this season \\u2014 Collins plays a carny in Guillermo del Toro\\u2019s lush noir \\u201cNightmare Alley\\u201d \\u2014 but it may be the one that makes the biggest difference.\", \"During a recent interview at a restaurant in the Studio City section of Los Angeles, where he wore a fittingly unpretentious Pink Floyd T-shirt, Homeboy Industries cap and cozy flannel shirt, he explained, \\u201cI\\u2019ve had other leading roles, just not like this.\\u201d\", \"The distinction isn\\u2019t only about screen time but also about his continuing collaboration with Bentley, a first-time director, and the producer Greg Kwedar, who cast him in his directorial debut, \\u201cTranspecos,\\u201d a 2016 thriller in which he played one of three Border Patrol agents forced into an illicit drug-trafficking mission. For \\u201cJockey,\\u201d Collins expanded his investment, and put his money on the line as an executive producer.\", \"To play Jackson, Collins dropped some weight from his already thin build to match the scrawny frame of a jockey. But that was only the superficial transformation. At Turf Paradise, the Phoenix racetrack where the film was shot, he became a grunt, hanging around every day and helping with the horses, to rid himself of the performer label in the eyes of the real riders.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t want to be seen as an actor. I didn\\u2019t want to be treated special,\\u201d he explained, adding, \\u201cTo be embraced by the very people you are portraying is the biggest gift that any actor could ask for.\\u201d\", \"When it comes to the integrity of a character, Collins goes all in, however small the part. For the 2001 prison drama \\u201cThe Last Castle,\\u201d he consulted multiple speech therapists before agreeing to play a character with a speaking impediment, even if it was only a supporting role. On another job, the 2009 comedy \\u201cSunshine Cleaning,\\u201d he nearly refused to embody an amputee because the director hadn\\u2019t thoroughly considered the details of the fictional man\\u2019s condition.\", \"His requests weren\\u2019t self-aggrandizing but a way of respecting the experiences of individuals for whom these circumstances aren\\u2019t a costume but their truth. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t just desecrate the challenges real people out there are trying to overcome,\\u201d he said.\", \"On \\u201cJockey,\\u201d Collins shares scenes with actual jockeys whom he tried to guide through the cinematic process with patience and space for spontaneity. The affecting banter in a hospital scene with an injured jockey, played by a real rider, Logan Cormier, resulted from the camaraderie he built over time with nonactors.\", \"\\u201cYou might take it for granted when he\\u2019s being generous alongside Clint Eastwood\\u201d in \\u201cThe Mule,\\u201d Bentley said. \\u201cBut to have that same generosity with somebody who\\u2019s never acted before and in some cases is never going to act again speaks volumes to his quality as a person and artist.\\u201d\", \"Collins, who was born and raised in the Los Angeles area, also channeled memories of his father, who, when sober enough, would take him and his sister to his trailer in Inglewood, Calif. When his father met friends at Hollywood Park, a racetrack nearby, he would occasionally let Collins tag along and taught him how to bet on horse races from a tender age. The final speech Jackson delivers in the film \\u2014 about Jackson\\u2019s father being an angry man who only showed affection while drunk or gambling \\u2014 came precisely from these bittersweet childhood memories.\", \"Del Toro turned to Collins for \\u201cNightmare Alley\\u201d (their second collaboration, after the kaiju epic \\u201cPacific Rim\\u201d) because the actor \\u201cseems incapable of anything but being truthful and present and brimming with ideas,\\u201d the director said via email. Collins \\u201chas a cadence, rhythm and delivery that no one else has,\\u201d del Toro added. \\u201cHe has cinema in his bloodline and his eyes. His eyes command the camera and our attention completely.\\u201d\", \"For the actor, wandering through the set of \\u201cNightmare Alley\\u201d felt like stepping into the bygone realm of his maternal grandfather, Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez, a proud Tejano and self-made entertainer whose career began in traveling tent shows, or carpas. The vaudeville-esque Mexican American diversions, like La Carpa Garcia, were popular during the first half of the 20th century, and Collins\\u2019s grandfather mostly performed for other Latinos working the fields in Texas. He would go on to work as a contract player for John Wayne, most notably in the seminal 1959 western \\u201cRio Bravo.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMy grandpa was the only person who said, \\u2018Yes, you can do it,\\u2019 and all it takes is one voice, one person you respect, to say it,\\u201d said Collins, who first tried to go college for engineering before dedicating himself full-time to acting, with his grandfather\\u2019s blessing.\", \"Collins said that it was his work on \\u201cCapote\\u201d (2005), in which he played the death-row inmate Perry Smith, that convinced Gonzalez-Gonzalez he\\u2019d have a future in acting. \\u201cHe was really worried if I was ever going to be successful or make it in this business,\\u201d Collins said.\", \"One evening while shooting \\u201cNightmare Alley\\u201d in Toronto, del Toro encouraged Collins to write a screenplay about Gonzalez-Gonzalez. Collins began writing that very night.\", \"Gonzalez-Gonzalez himself received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011, five years after his death and decades after he first sought it. Instinctively switching to Spanish whenever quoting his grandfather, Collins recalled: \\u201cWhen he got cancer, the second he told me, \\u2018Mijo, I\\u2019ve had a life bigger that I could ever dreamt of, the only thing I never got was that pinche star,\\u2019 and I said, \\u2018Grandpa, I promise you I\\u2019m going to get you that star.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The promise was kept thanks in part to the advocacy of Samuel L. Jackson, whom Collins considers a father figure. The two starred together in the 1997 crime drama \\u201cOne Eight Seven,\\u201d in which Collins played a young gangbanger opposite Jackson\\u2019s high school teacher, and have remained close friends ever since.\", \"Collins embodies the \\u201cthere are no small parts, only small actors\\u201d truism, Jackson said, citing \\u201cthe preparation, the attention to detail, the love of the craft.\\u201d Collins is \\u201cthe kind of actor that demands your best and gives you his.\\u201d\", \"Onscreen, Collins has walked on both sides of the law, as a border agent on several occasions, and many others as men behind bars, like Cesar in \\u201cOne Eight Seven.\\u201d But there\\u2019s a double standard for Latinos, he said, when it comes to roles that, while psychologically three-dimensional and rich, are not positive portrayals or seem to perpetuate stereotypes. With \\u201cOne Eight Seven,\\u201d mainstream critics discredited him, the actor said, by suggesting the production had simply found a real criminal for the part, as if he couldn\\u2019t have been an actor who worked on the role. Meanwhile, he said, the ALMA Awards, which honor American Latinos in entertainment, wouldn\\u2019t consider his performance because they only highlight what they consider to be edifying representation.\", \"\\u201cHow come Robert De Niro and Al Pacino can get awards for playing gangsters of their communities? But when we play gangsters of our communities, they say, \\u2018Don\\u2019t do that. We got to be the good immigrants.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"One of his most notable criminal characters was the morally conflicted robber Jack \\u201cBump\\u201d Hill in the mini-series \\u201cThief,\\u201d for which he received an Emmy nomination. The show\\u2019s creator, Norman Morrill, recalled that Collins wasn\\u2019t enthusiastic about doing more television work. The actor admits his hesitation came from arrogance. He had romanticized the struggling actor persona.\", \"Convinced of his magnetism, Morrill persuaded him to join the cast opposite Andre Braugher. \\u201cA lot of actors need words to communicate; the really great ones don\\u2019t. Cliffy\\u2019s silence sizzles,\\u201d the showrunner said. \\u201cThe camera can just sit there and you go, \\u2018I\\u2019m going to watch this.\\u2019 That\\u2019s about as great an accolade anybody can get.\\u201d\", \"Bentley also saw the silent fire within, notably in the very last scene of \\u201cJockey,\\u201d when Jackson is walking away after a defining moment. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about three minutes long on his face, and he\\u2019s going through this whole color wheel of emotions,\\u201d the director said. \\u201cYou could not write dialogue that would get across what he\\u2019s giving the audience. We get exactly what he\\u2019s going through.\\u201d\", \"With \\u201cJockey\\u201d and \\u201cNightmare Alley\\u201d behind him, a determined Collins has shifted focus back to polishing the script about his grandfather. Having honed his storytelling skills for years helming music videos for country performers like the Zac Brown Band (\\u201cChicken Fried\\u201d) and Jamey Johnson (\\u201cHigh Cost of Living\\u201d), he also aims to direct it.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s the only singular goal I have,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cI can\\u2019t see past that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f9eda3cc6a4a11ecb1ae991b9f4a4662"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f9eda3cc6a4a11ecb1ae991b9f4a4662"}},
