So we really want to make offers now if we can so that students can start arriving as soon as possible in the first semester of next year,\\\" he said.\", \"Schools International Education Business Association chief executive John van der Zwan said he was not expecting a flood of enrolments as a result of the government's announcement.\", \"\\\"The recovery for the school sector is going to be gradual.
