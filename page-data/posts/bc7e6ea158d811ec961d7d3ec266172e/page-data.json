The Russian ambassador joined his Chinese counterpart in charging Washington with a new \\u201cCold War mentality.\\u201d Yet the real problem with the summit is more prosaic. It\\u2019s the framing of the contest between democracy and autocracy as one about which can deliver the goods of growth and stability.\", \"Such a framing encourages turning a blind eye to business-friendly far-right leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, and plays into the hands of aspiring authoritarians in Western democracies, such as Donald Trump and Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, who envision running states like a business. Most important, it sells democracy \\u2014 an ideal based on freedom and equality \\u2014 short.\", \"The summit has set itself a number of tasks, among them fighting corruption and promoting human rights. Such goals are worthy, of course. But it should also aim to do something simpler, yet crucial in competition with autocracies: make the case for democracy in its fundamentals, as a sturdy system of equal respect for all, alive to the uncertainty of mass participation.\", \"Democracy is not just instrumentally valuable \\u2014 if that were the case, we might give it up for systems that deliver more. It is valuable in itself.\", \"Hopelessly na\\u00efve? Well, it seems that argument has actually been won already. Even detractors of the summit do not denounce democracy in the abstract: Autocrats simply relativize it by insisting that no model fits all. Intellectuals from Budapest to Beijing stand ready to adorn such self-serving claims with fancy euphemisms for fake democracy, such as \\u201cilliberal democracy\\u201d and \\u201cwhole-process people\\u2019s democracy.\\u201d\", \"True, concepts central to modern political experience are subject to fierce argument. Yet judgments about democracy are not simply subjective. At a minimum, according to the Polish-born political scientist Adam Przeworski, democracy is \\u201ca regime in which incumbents lose elections and leave office if they do.\\u201d\", \"Autocrats do their best to avoid either fate. They carefully stage-manage elections to leave no doubt about the results \\u2014 and if their power is threatened, they are always ready to change procedures. Today, aspiring authoritarians within traditional democracies pursue the same strategy, as the Republicans\\u2019 gerrymandering and placing of partisans to subvert election outcomes not to their liking amply shows.\", \"There\\u2019s more to Mr. Przeworski\\u2019s laconic definition. It points, in the first instance, to certainty. For incumbents to lose and leave office, there needs to be a common acceptance of democratic procedures, such as fair election laws, that underwrite the whole process. But it also means embracing uncertainty. The candidate who won last time could lose this time around; unpredictability is a feature, not a bug.\", \"Uncertainty is not in itself a value \\u2014 after nearly two years of the pandemic, we could be forgiven for wishing the future were more certain. Yet the uncertainty in democracy is, at root, a result of citizens\\u2019 freedom. We do not know what will happen, because people can change their minds or come up with something entirely new.\", \"Underlying that is something intrinsic to democracy: faith in fellow citizens. You do not give up on people who count as your political equals. Of course, you must first recognize them as such: Among other things, many Trumpists tend to deny election losses because they don\\u2019t regard Black and brown people as part of a legitimate majority. But the sign of a functioning democracy is not that everyone is civil \\u2014 conflict can be messy. It\\u2019s that no distinction is drawn between first- and second-class citizens, or between the \\u201creal people\\u201d beloved of right-wing populists and everyone else.\", \"The marriage of certainty and uncertainty gives democracy its distinct character. Alexis de Tocqueville remarked on the strange coexistence in democracies of chaos and commotion on the surface, and a bedrock confidence citizens have in one another and their political system. There are, naturally, no guarantees. One illusion plenty in the West shared after the Cold War was that democracies would always self-correct and renew themselves. Not only was that not the case, but also we have learned the hard way that authoritarians can learn from mistakes, too.\", \"What they cannot do is assure citizens of equal political status. They might deliver prosperity, but no sense of an open future: The \\u201csocial stability\\u201d promoted by intellectuals supportive of the Chinese Communist Party is one in which people can never truly enjoy their freedoms because the powerful might suddenly turn against them. The authoritarian figures who have been invited to the summit \\u2014 such as Mr. Modi and President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil \\u2014 should above all be criticized for inciting hatred against parts of their own populations. Short of declaring dictatorship, one can hardly get more undemocratic.\", \"Longstanding democracies ought to be self-critical not because they lack stability or suffer from \\u201cexcessive democracy,\\u201d as Chinese officials put it. They should worry precisely about the opposite: that too little can change in their systems and that some do not enjoy political equality. At home, Mr. Biden has his work cut out. The United States remains threatened by plutocratic populism, a toxic combination of culture war on the ground and the ultrawealthy trying to capture the political system at the top.\", \"Anxious for the gathering not to turn into a photo-op plus three-minute pontifications by a hundred leaders, Mr. Biden is asking invitees to make specific commitments to be checked on at another summit in a year\\u2019s time. Even if it\\u2019s hard to imagine Iraq, Angola or, for that matter, Poland taking steps to make current rulers feel more uncertain, the United States should lead the way by strengthening voting rights and making political power less dependent on money.\", \"Such concrete reforms would be especially powerful if combined with an affirmation of democracy\\u2019s virtues that goes beyond a predictable pep talk. Yes, democracy might not always deliver the goods immediately. But it\\u2019s the only system that can secure the political standing of all, as well as political contests that don\\u2019t always produce the same winners. You really can\\u2019t put a price on that.\"]","href_hash":"bc7e6ea158d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bc7e6ea158d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}},
