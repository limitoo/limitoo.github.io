But while ticket sales for classical music and opera have reportedly been soft elsewhere in the country, most of the events I\\u2019ve attended here in the city have had sizable audiences.\", \"So it was on Tuesday, when the New York Philharmonic \\u2014 joined by Apollo\\u2019s Singers, the chorus of the early-music ensemble Apollo\\u2019s Fire, and four superb vocal soloists, all led by Jeannette Sorrell \\u2014 gave a splendid performance of Handel\\u2019s \\u201cMessiah\\u201d at Riverside Church.\", \"Before the concert, ticket holders waited patiently in a line that circled the block to enter the church, after going through a vaccination check and temperature reading. With seating for about 1,430 inside, the performance was sold out. (There are limited tickets through Saturday.)\", \"\\u201cMessiah\\u201d is so familiar that it\\u2019s difficult for a performance to stand out. But this one did \\u2014 not because Sorrell brought any striking interpretive approach to the score, but because she guided a lithe, glowing and elegant performance from the fine soloists, stirring chorus and orchestra.\", \"This was the Philharmonic debut of Sorrell, who founded Apollo\\u2019s Fire, based in Cleveland, 30 years ago. Starting with the Sinfonia, the players brought qualities associated with early music to bear: focused sound (with just a touch of vibrato), supple flow and clear articulation.\", \"Though there was wonderful vitality in the performance, Sorrell tapped into the melancholic underside of Handel\\u2019s work, even during spirited choruses \\u2014 sung with rich, robust sound and crisp diction by Apollo\\u2019s Singers \\u2014 and ardent arias. (She made some cuts to keep the evening, with an intermission, to two hours and 15 minutes.)\", \"This \\u201cMessiah\\u201d offered as rewarding a quartet of soloists as you are likely to hear this holiday season. The appealing tenor Nicholas Phan set the mood for the evening in the recitative \\u201cComfort ye, my people,\\u201d performed with melting sound and beguiling sincerity, and the rousing aria \\u201cEv\\u2019ry valley shall be exalted.\\u201d\", \"The soprano Amanda Forsythe, in her Philharmonic debut, sang with shimmering sound and tenderness. The formidable bass-baritone Kevin Deas brought chilling fervor to \\u201cWhy do the nations so furiously rage together,\\u201d yet exuded palpable joy in \\u201cThe trumpet shall sound\\u201d (abetted by Christopher Martin\\u2019s clarion trumpet playing).\", \"Then there was the remarkable countertenor John Holiday, also making his Philharmonic debut, who is having a momentous week in New York. He recently made his Metropolitan Opera debut as Orpheus\\u2019s double in Matthew Aucoin\\u2019s \\u201cEurydice,\\u201d a role he created when the work premiered in Los Angeles in February 2020. (Holiday will sing the final performance of the opera on Thursday, his only night off from this string of \\u201cMessiah\\u201d performances.)\", \"His gleaming voice is natural and full-bodied, even in its top range. And there is almost a baritonal cast to his singing when he dips lower. Beyond his sound, the directness and charismatic intensity of his singing were captivating. An auspicious debut.\", \"At the end, the audience, having gone through some rigors to enter the church, was in no hurry to leave, as a hearty ovation went on.\"]","href_hash":"de62ba725dcd11ec87d345d49f11332b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"de62ba725dcd11ec87d345d49f11332b"}},
