Plans call for Irus to grow to 450 homes, said Avraham Monarov of Israel Sotheby\\u2019s International Realty, the listing agent, who called this house \\u201cmodern-minimalist, luxurious, and completely unique for this area.\\u201d\", \"The ground level features smooth concrete floors and textured concrete walls, which recur throughout. A sprawling great room with 13-foot ceilings encompasses the living room, dining area and kitchen. A large black island anchors the kitchen, whose Bosch oven and DeLonghi refrigerator are concealed behind pressed-wood panels. Walls of glass connect the great room to a tiered concrete outdoor deck and an in-ground pool, all surrounded by a low concrete wall. At the other end of the great room, floor-to-ceiling wood panels in contrasting hues create dramatic backdrops for sleek furnishings in black fabric and blond wood.\", \"Set behind the kitchen, the primary suite is the only bedroom on the ground floor. Like all of the bedrooms, it has an en suite bathroom and walk-in closet.\", \"Behind a \\u201ccurtain\\u201d of thin aluminum poles, dark wood stairs float from the great room to the second floor, with the four remaining bedroom suites and a small maintenance room for the home\\u2019s smart technology. Beneath the great room, the unfinished basement can be converted to a rental unit, Mr. Monarov said.\", \"With Tel Aviv easily accessible, Irus has become a destination for professionals in Israel\\u2019s booming high-tech sector, Mr. Monarov said. Palmachim Beach National Park, a popular nature preserve and recreation spot, is about five miles away. Irus offers limited services, with one synagogue and a convenience store, while wider shopping options and professional services are available in the bigger cities nearby. Israel\\u2019s main airport, Ben Gurion, is about 15 miles northeast.\", \"Across Israel, as in many markets worldwide, \\u201cthe super challenge is very low inventory and very high demand,\\u201d said Daniel Goldstein, director of the Beauchamp Estates realty firm in Tel Aviv. \\u201cThe main issue of price is slow planning, which creates a supply drag against soaring demand. We have many more buyers looking for property than we have properties on the market.\\u201d\", \"Despite an initial cooling as the pandemic took hold in 2020, \\u201cthe market kept up its momentum,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOne of my most difficult conversations is telling people, \\u2018You haven\\u2019t got time \\u2014 make a decision.\\u2019 I\\u2019m doing it much more than I\\u2019m comfortable.\\u201d\", \"Israel was already facing a housing shortage before the pandemic, said Nicole Izbicki, an agent at Jerusalem Immobilier in Jerusalem. \\u201cWe still don\\u2019t have enough apartments, pandemic or not,\\u201d she said. Apartments make up most of the market in cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, with detached houses more prevalent in remote areas and suburbs. Though construction of apartments accelerated by 7 percent in 2021, Ms. Izbicki said, \\u201cit\\u2019s far from sufficient. There\\u2019s very little choice, and you have to take what there is.\\u201d\", \"The pandemic also caused a shift in how Israelis view living spaces, Ms. Izbicki said, creating more market pressure. \\u201cIf an Israeli has a nice apartment, they\\u2019ll renovate every 10 years, but they won\\u2019t move without a particular reason,\\u201d she said. \\u201cNow, we\\u2019re seeing pandemic moves. People are much more afraid of the next lockdown. They want space, a balcony, a garden.\\u201d\", \"Israel maintained its position this year as one of the region\\u2019s most expensive housing markets, according to the 2021 Deloitte Property Index, with average home prices at 4,052 euros a square meter ($425 a square foot). In Tel Aviv, Deloitte reported the average price per square foot at $1,056 \\u2014 up 5.6 percent since 2019.\", \"Mr. Monarov said the beach areas of Tel Aviv have seen prices nearly double in recent years, with detached homes now averaging about 130,000 shekels a square meter ($3,880 a square foot). \\u201cA detached home in Israel is considered a luxury,\\u201d he said. Away from the sea, home prices can drop to 75,000 shekels a square meter ($2,240 a square foot), he said.\", \"The entry point for an apartment in Tel Aviv is about $1,850 a square foot \\u201cfor a modern building with an elevator,\\u201d according to Mr. Goldstein, rising to about $5,500 a square foot \\u201cfor a penthouse in a modern building on the waterfront.\\u201d\", \"In Jerusalem, \\u201cthe minimum of the minimum\\u201d price is about $560 a square foot, Ms. Izbicki said, while the \\u201ctypical\\u201d price of an apartment can be double that \\u2014 \\u201cbut the sky\\u2019s the limit,\\u201d she said.\", \"Ms. Izbicki noted that apartment prices have spiked by 160 percent over the past decade, and average property values nationwide have tripled in 20 years. \\u201cI keep telling buyers that if they wait, they\\u2019ll end up paying 1 percent more each month, which can end up being a lot of money.\\u201d\", \"A 93-mile light-rail system across metropolitan Tel Aviv, set for completion in 2032, is also starting to affect the market. Investors are speculating on properties along the train lines, \\u201cthough not at the high end of the market,\\u201d said Noam Dzialdow, a founding partner and agent at realty firm Neot Shiran, which specializes in luxury properties.\", \"Foreigners have historically played an outsize role in Israel\\u2019s high-end property market, so the country\\u2019s on-and-off pandemic border closures have profoundly impacted sales. \\u201cThere\\u2019s huge demand from abroad, but the execution of deals is almost impossible when people can\\u2019t fly in and out,\\u201d Mr. Dzialdow said.\", \"Locals, however, have picked up the slack, Mr. Dzialdow said. \\u201cAfter the summer of 2020, locals started buying like crazy, including properties that foreigners would have bought,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat change is major.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Monarov, the Sotheby\\u2019s listing agent, said that before the pandemic, 85 percent of his firm\\u2019s clients came from overseas. \\u201cWhen the pandemic started, it became 85 percent Israelis and 15 percent foreigners,\\u201d he said. Most of his non-Israeli buyers come from the United States, France, Britain and South Africa.\", \"Both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv have seen significant shifts in perceptions among buyers, Mr. Goldstein said. Jerusalem has become home to some of Israel\\u2019s highest-flying tech companies, including the autonomous-driving developer Mobileye. Meanwhile, \\u201cmore observant Jews from the U.S. are now considering Tel Aviv, not just Jerusalem,\\u201d he said. \\u201cTel Aviv\\u2019s a very different city than it was 20 years ago \\u2014 cosmopolitan, sophisticated, and affluent.\\u201d\", \"There are no restrictions on most foreign buyers of residential property in Israel, according to Rahav Aharoni, founder of the Aharoni Law Firm, which operates in Israel and the U.S.\", \"By law, buyers and sellers must retain their own lawyers, and international buyers can assign power of attorney to execute transactions remotely, Mr. Aharoni said. Most lawyers will charge buyers 1 to 1.5 percent of the sale price, \\u201cdepending on the nature of the transaction.\\u201d\", \"Lawyers must \\u201cconduct full due diligence\\u201d on a property, including research through Israel\\u2019s Land Registration Bureau database, Mr. Aharoni said. A document called a nesach tabu, or land-registry extract, confirms legal ownership of the property and enables a transaction to proceed.\", \"Once both parties execute a sale agreement, they must register the sale with the Israel Tax Authority, said Nimrod Yaron, managing partner at the accounting firm Nimrod Yaron & Co. in Tel Aviv.\", \"Foreigners commonly obtain mortgages from Israeli banks, Mr. Yaron said. \\u201cIn some cases, my clients get up to 70 percent in financing, with 50 percent through a mortgage and the rest in a conventional loan,\\u201d he said. For investors, he added, \\u201cinterest rates are very low right now, and a good rental can cover your mortgage payments.\\u201d\", \"Hebrew; Israeli Shekel (1 shekel = $0.32)\", \"Purchase taxes are \\u201cpretty high,\\u201d Mr. Yaron said, though there are different tax brackets for Israelis, foreign buyers and new immigrants. Foreigners pay 8 percent of the total purchase price up to 5.3 million shekels ($1.7 million), and 10 percent above that, while newcomers pay just 0.5 percent on the first 1.8 million shekels ($575,000).\", \"Realtor commissions average 2 percent of the sale price, along with a value-added tax of 17 percent, Ms. Izbicki said, adding that \\u201cboth the buyer and seller pay that amount.\\u201d\", \"Monthly property taxes on this home are 1,400 shekels ($450), Mr. Monarov said.\", \"Avraham Monarov, Sotheby\\u2019s International Realty, 972-3771-0977, israelsir.com\"]","href_hash":"14ca5a946e3511ecae17a7528219ac28"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"14ca5a946e3511ecae17a7528219ac28"}},
