Insurers are not only among the largest institutional investors, their ability to withdraw insurance coverage can hinder a company\\u2019s operations.\", \"Insurance companies also pay when climate change causes natural disasters, which cost the industry $82 billion last year, according to the insurer Munich Re.\", \"AXA, the French insurance company, has eagerly leaned into its levers for reducing carbon emissions. In 2015, AXA became the first insurer to start divesting from coal, and it is now chair of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance, a pledge signed by eight of the world\\u2019s largest insurers and reinsurers who have committed to have underwriting portfolios with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\", \"The majority of the signatories are European insurers. U.S. insurers, including AIG and Berkshire Hathaway, have not agreed to the terms. AXA\\u2019s chief executive, Thomas Buberl, has made it his mission to change that.\", \"You were perhaps the first to embrace insurers\\u2019 role in climate change. What drove your decision?\", \"We saw this whole question around climate transition very early on because as an insurer, you basically have two perspectives: You have the investment perspective, and you\\u2019ve got the underwriting perspective. And from the underwriting perspective, you also see, later on, the claims. And what we\\u2019ve seen from very early on was: Yes, investment in coal, and so on, seems to be quite an isolated and attractive investment \\u2014 but then when you blend in the claims side, what happens to natural catastrophes and companies that we insure in terms of flooding, fires and so on? What happens to the patients that we have with their health? The equation doesn\\u2019t work.\", \"Why do you believe that underwriting is the key to driving out the coal industry?\", \"Even if all the insurers say, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t invest in coal anymore,\\u201d even if all the banks say, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t invest in coal anymore,\\u201d there is still private individuals who say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll give you the money for coal.\\u201d Whereas on the insurance side, if you don\\u2019t have the insurance, you will have no financing \\u2014 whether it\\u2019s private, public, from an insurer, from an asset manager, whatever.\", \"And so we said, \\u201cLook, by bringing the majority of this market together, because [there\\u2019s] only let\\u2019s say 12, 15 actors globally who do this business \\u2014 if we get together and if we agree on principles of what to do we still insure and what do we not insure anymore \\u2014 without violating any antitrust rules \\u2014 we will create a very powerful coalition to really drive this market out.\", \"There are a couple ways in which the government could step in on this issue. A regulator could integrate capital charges for unsustainable investments. Or it could take a taxonomy approach for green activities like it has in the European Union. Should, or will, that happen in the U.S.?\", \"Look at other areas like diversity quotas. Why have they arrived? Because companies haven\\u2019t done their job early enough. Being proactive and making sure that there is enough diversity on their boards, on their management teams and so on. And so I\\u2019m always a believer of the basis that you don\\u2019t need government if you have sorted it out yourself. Unfortunately, it doesn\\u2019t always happen. But in this case, we are still early enough I think, to sort it out ourselves.\", \"You\\u2019ve met personally with executives of major insurers to encourage them to sign the pledge. When you talk to them, what is their biggest concern?\", \"It\\u2019s a question of, if I exclude customers, what does it mean for my relationships, what does it mean for my business. Because it is true, all those industries in question on the insurance side, the underwriting side, are very large customers.\", \"When we went out of coal investment \\u2014 I had a whole speech from my investment team. \\u201cAre you crazy? You will never find investments that have the same yield.\\u201d When I look now, five years later, we have allocated over $20 billion \\u2014 our aim is now to go even further to $24, $25 billion \\u2014 we have allocated that money into green investments. The yield is not so different to what we would have seen in the coal sector. The same was true on the underwriting side. We had to let go of a significant amount of business by not ensuring corporate use anymore. But have you seen any dip in our gross numbers? No, you haven\\u2019t.\", \"In 20 years, will major insurance companies be underwriting coal?\", \"You don\\u2019t need to wait 20 years for that.\", \"Will they be out in five years?\", \"No, but if you take us: We are completely out of coal in O.E.C.D [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] by 2030 and non-O.E.C.D. by 2040. I do believe that also, in non-O.E.C.D. countries, the pressure is rising every day. So those dates will probably be brought forward. I would say in 10 years from now, you will be mostly out.\"]","href_hash":"dfcfb0024c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dfcfb0024c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}},
