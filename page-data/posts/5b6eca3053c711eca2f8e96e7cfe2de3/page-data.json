Legislators could cram urban Democrats into one or two districts to preserve the surrounding districts for Republicans, or divide them among many districts in which they would be outvoted.\", \"That hasn\\u2019t stopped. But redistricting maps approved this year show the battle lines radiating outward to the suburbs, where Republicans are trying to build levees against an increasingly Democratic and multiracial tide.\", \"What\\u2019s striking is how thoroughly the racial diversification and leftward shift of the suburbs have changed the task for the architects of gerrymandering: The suburbs, historically used by Republicans to defend against the electoral threat of cities, are now themselves a threat.\", \"\\u201cYou used to crack the urban areas and join them to the suburbs, and now you\\u2019re having to crack the suburbs and join them to rural areas,\\u201d said Michael Li, senior counsel for the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \\u201cWhat these tactics show is that Republicans are not confident that they\\u2019re going to get white suburban voters back in anywhere near the numbers they need anytime soon, so they\\u2019re hedging their bets by treating the suburbs as enemy territory as opposed to friendly territory.\\u201d\", \"These changes also reduce the voting power of communities of color even though those are the communities whose growth earned states like Texas new congressional seats.\", \"Take Texas\\u2019 13th Congressional District, which extends 450 miles from the Texas Panhandle to just outside the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and which the Republican-controlled State Legislature redrew this year to include increasingly blue suburbs north of Dallas and Fort Worth. The district has always been Republican and will remain so; its new Democratic residents are far too few to make a difference. And dissolving them into the red \\u2014 and white \\u2014 seas of the Panhandle enabled Republicans to cram the rest of the Dallas-Fort Worth region\\u2019s Democrats into three districts instead of four.\", \"Or look at the 22nd Congressional District, south of Houston. It was previously centered on Fort Bend County, which is home to Asian, Black and Latino communities and voted for President Biden. The district\\u2019s new lines encompass rural areas to the southwest, putting it out of Democratic reach after two election cycles in which a Democrat, Sri Preston Kulkarni, was competitive. Much of Fort Bend County will move into the Seventh District, already held by a Democrat.\", \"In some cases, Republicans have ceded cities in order to shore up the suburbs. Previously, Texas legislators split Travis County \\u2014 which includes Austin \\u2014 among five districts, four of them red. This year, they gave Austin two Democratic districts in exchange for safe Republican seats all around it.\", \"Republicans are also taking aim at suburbs in Georgia, where Democrats flipped two Atlanta-area House districts \\u2014 the Sixth in 2018 and the Seventh in 2020 \\u2014 that were once Republican strongholds. Those Democratic gains stemmed in part from political shifts among white suburbanites but also from Black, Asian and Latino population growth.\", \"Under maps passed by Georgia\\u2019s Republican-led legislature, the bluest parts of both districts would be stuffed into the Seventh, while rural territory in northwestern Georgia would neutralize the remainder of the suburbs and make the Sixth District safely Republican.\", \"Allison Riggs, a co-executive director and chief counsel for voting rights at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, emphasized North Carolina. There, legislators packed urban voters into one district each in Charlotte and Raleigh, and parceled out the increasingly Democratic and decreasingly white suburbs among several.\", \"\\u201cYou know in these counties and in these areas, there are enough votes to create new opportunities for voters of color, new opportunities for Democrats,\\u201d Riggs said. \\u201cAnd instead they\\u2019re carved up like a pizza pie.\\u201d\", \"Neil Makhija, the executive director of the advocacy group Indian American Impact, noted that growing Asian American communities had helped turn many suburbs blue, including in Georgia and North Carolina last year, when they voted in larger numbers than they had in previous elections.\", \"He expressed concern about the new district lines around Dallas and Fort Worth that link suburban Indian American communities to rural counties along the Oklahoma border.\", \"The \\u201cG.O.P. can pack or crack our communities and claim they aren\\u2019t racial gerrymandering, but instead using partisan indicators,\\u201d Makhija said, adding that his group was also closely watching redistricting in Democratic states like New York and California. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no difference to us, however, because the end result is the same: We lose our voice in the process.\\u201d\", \"In lawsuits, advocacy groups are still focusing largely on cities, where they have the strongest cases under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It requires mapmakers to draw opportunity districts \\u2014 where a racial minority group is a majority of the voting-age population \\u2014 under certain conditions when demographics make it possible.\", \"In the Texas suburbs, Latino communities are growing but are generally not large enough to create congressional opportunity districts, said Nina Perales, vice president of litigation at the Latino civil rights organization MALDEF, which is suing Texas officials for failing to draw Latino-majority districts in urban areas of Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston, as well as in South Texas.\", \"The targets in the suburbs, she said, are more often multiracial communities where no single racial group could form a majority in a congressional district, but multiple racial groups with aligned interests and political preferences could.\", \"But state legislative districts can be a different story.\", \"\\u201cIf an incumbent started out last decade in a district that was not majority Latino, but through the course of the decade, with the incremental growth and relative growth of communities, their district has become majority Latino \\u2014 that\\u2019s when we are concerned that it could lead to the dismantling of an existing Latino-majority district,\\u201d said Thomas A. Saenz, the president and general counsel of MALDEF. And because of demographic patterns since 2010, a lot of the districts that fit that description are in the suburbs.\", \"Maps that disadvantage people of color are not unique to Republicans. In Illinois, where Democrats are aggressively gerrymandering, Saenz cited a State Senate seat in the western suburbs of Chicago that is held by a white Democrat. That district \\u2014 currently the 12th, but renumbered as the 11th on the new map \\u2014 gained a Latino majority over the past decade, and legislators redrew it in a way that eliminated the majority, a move MALDEF is challenging.\", \"But most of the gerrymandering is Republican, both because Republicans control the drawing of far more districts than Democrats do and because demographics are shifting in Democrats\\u2019 favor.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re really starting to see the emergence of a new multiracial America, the politics of the future,\\u201d Li, of the Brennan Center for Justice, said. \\u201cAnd instead of deciding to compete for that future, Republicans have decided to kick the can down the road and try to gerrymander their way out of their problem.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"5b6eca3053c711eca2f8e96e7cfe2de3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5b6eca3053c711eca2f8e96e7cfe2de3"}},
