The kurta was made by Prada, and Mr. Ahmed\\u2019s decision to wear one was an object lesson in the politics of style.\", \"Responding to a reporter\\u2019s query about the garment, Prada referred to it simply and generically as a long silk shirt. Yet the nomenclature matters because, as Mr. Ahmed explained, code-switching as a survival strategy was once necessary for him, though broader understandings \\u2014 and equity initiatives within his industry \\u2014 have slowly \\u201cstretched\\u201d a culture that took its sweet time getting around to diversity.\", \"Born and raised in northwest London, in a family of Pakistani origin, Mr. Ahmed was educated at Oxford and has spoken openly of the alienation he experienced there. Thus for him, wearing a kurta to a movie event was both an act of reclamation and, equally, a chance for him to tweak \\u201cEurocentric and precolonial\\u201d notions about what masculinity means.\", \"\\u201cGrowing up, I might be wearing a salwar kameez and then switch into my suit-and-tie English uniform, and then skip class to hang with my boys in Reeboks and an off-key print shirt from Moschino, probably fake,\\u201d Mr. Ahmed said. \\u201cThese days, I\\u2019m becoming more and more interested in not having to leave part of myself at the door as I enter a room.\\u201d\", \"These days Mr. Ahmed, of course, has his pick of designers eager to associate themselves with an actor who, following his intense and nuanced performance in \\u201cSound of Metal,\\u201d is so much in demand he has become a regular red carpet presence. \\u201cWearing a kurta to a premiere signals to the world what kind of space that is now and what is acceptable in that space,\\u201d Mr. Ahmed said. \\u201cThis is something we\\u2019ve both thought about a lot.\\u201d\", \"The other person he was referring to is Julie Ragolia, an influential stylist Mr. Ahmed has collaborated with for the last few years. Reached on the phone in Madrid, where she was styling an advertising campaign, Ms. Ragolia explained that in her work she tries to sneak in subtle gestures grounded in the philosophy studies of her prefashion years.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s always an element of the political,\\u201d she said, and a case in point is a recent cover of the Sunday Times of London\\u2019s Style magazine for which she outfitted Jake Gyllenhaal in a fuzzy grandpa pullover from Prada. The sweater selection itself was uncontroversial, yet the color, a shade of pink traditionally reserved for teen girl diaries and baby girl onesies, was still startling when worn by a hunk.\", \"Mr. Ahmed\\u2019s approach, he said on the phone, is more easygoing. \\u201cIf I\\u2019m really, really honest with you,\\u201d he said, \\u201cwhat I want is to be unapologetically myself.\\u201d\", \"Publicly presenting that self in its varied dimensions may be progressive all on its own. \\u201cThink about it,\\u201d Ms. Ragolia said. \\u201cOnce upon a time, Riz in a kurta would have immediately put him in a box: Muslim actor.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve wanted to do a kurta on the red carpet for a while,\\u201d she said.\", \"It was not until midway through the obligatory step-and-repeat at the \\u201cEncounter\\u201d premiere that Ms. Ragolia had what she referred to as her, \\u201cHell, yeah!\\u201d moment, though the language she used was saltier.\", \"As the cameras flashed and the actors clocked through their paces, Ms. Ragolia observed how elegant Mr. Ahmed looked in his Prada kurta and how welcome it was to see something on a red carpet besides a designer tuxedo. \\u201cIt was like: That\\u2019s sexy. That\\u2019s hot. I bet people are saying, \\u2018I\\u2019d wear that.\\u2019\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"cd28aad35d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cd28aad35d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}},
