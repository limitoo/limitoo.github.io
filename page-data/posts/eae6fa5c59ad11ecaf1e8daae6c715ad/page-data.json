Because it is.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-10T11:41:06.000Z","content":"[\"Offices remain eerily empty. Airlines have canceled thousands of flights. Subways and buses are running less often. Schools sometimes call off entire days of class. Consumers waste time waiting in store lines. Annual inflation has reached its highest level in three decades.\", \"Does this sound like a healthy economy to you?\", \"In recent weeks, economists and pundits have been asking why Americans feel grouchy about the economy when many indicators \\u2014 like G.D.P. growth, stock prices and the unemployment rate \\u2014 look strong.\", \"But I think the answer to this supposed paradox is that it\\u2019s not really a paradox: Americans think the economy is in rough shape because the economy is in rough shape.\", \"Sure, some major statistics look good, and they reflect true economic strengths, including the state of families\\u2019 finances. But the economy is more than a household balance sheet; it is the combined experience of working, shopping and interacting in society. Americans evidently understand the distinction: In an Associated Press poll, 64 percent describe their personal finances as good \\u2014 and only 35 percent describe the national economy as good.\", \"There are plenty of reasons. Many services don\\u2019t function as well as they used to, largely because of supply-chain problems and labor shortages. Rising prices are cutting into paychecks, especially for working-class households. People spend less time socializing. The unending nature of the pandemic \\u2014 the masks, Covid tests, Zoom meetings and anxiety-producing runny noses \\u2014 is wearying.\", \"While some of these disruptions are minor inconveniences, others are causing serious troubles. The increase in social isolation has harmed both physical and mental health. Americans\\u2019 blood pressure has risen. Fatal drug overdoses have soared, with a growing toll among Black Americans. A report this week from the surgeon general found that depression, anxiety, impulsive behavior and attempted suicides had all risen among children and adolescents.\", \"\\u201cIt would be a tragedy if we beat back one public health crisis only to allow another to grow in its place,\\u201d Dr. Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, wrote.\", \"Schools are a particular source of frustration. Last year, the closure of in-person school caused large learning losses. This year, teachers have the near-impossible task of trying to help students make up for lost time, which has left many teachers feeling burned out.\", \"And school operations are still not back to normal. Students are sometimes forbidden to sit or talk with one another during lunch \\u2014 or to eat indoors. Masks make communication harder, especially for students with learning disabilities. Positive Covid tests or worker shortages can cause schools to close temporarily.\", \"After Jennifer Reesman\\u2019s local school in Maryland closed for a day recently, she told NPR, \\u201cOur community can no longer count on the public schools.\\u201d\", \"As is often the case in our politically polarized era, the situation differs in red and blue America.\", \"In Republican-leaning communities, the biggest Covid problem remains a widespread refusal to take the pandemic seriously. About 40 percent of Republican adults have not received a vaccine shot, according to the most recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll. As a result, the Covid death rate is far higher in heavily Republican counties than in Democratic ones.\", \"Red America\\u2019s Covid denialism doesn\\u2019t seem to be abating, either. Fox News continues to spread disinformation, as Margaret Sullivan of The Washington Post has noted. Many Republican politicians spend more time complaining about mask and vaccine mandates than trying to persuade conservatives to get a potentially lifesaving shot.\", \"Blue America, by contrast, has taken Covid seriously. Fewer than 10 percent of Democratic voters have not received a vaccine shot. Political liberals also tend to be comfortable wearing masks to reduce the spread of the Covid virus.\", \"Yet many Democrats, both voters and politicians, have been almost blas\\u00e9 about the costs of Covid precautions \\u2014 the isolation, unhappiness, health damage, lost learning, inflation, public-transit disruptions and more. Democrats have sometimes focused on minimizing the spread of Covid, regardless of the downsides: Closing schools, for example, almost certainly harms children more than it protects them, given the minuscule rate of severe childhood Covid, even lower than that of severe childhood flu.\", \"Consider this recent data from Gallup on the relative happiness and anxiety of Democratic and Republican voters:\", \"There are few easy solutions here because trade-offs are unavoidable.\", \"Although Covid presents relatively few risks to children and vaccinated adults under 50, it presents more to older people and some with specific immunodeficiencies. The current Covid surge has led to a modest rise in hospitalizations and deaths among the vaccinated and a much sharper rise among the unvaccinated. This surge justifies an increase in masking, testing and some other measures.\", \"But it\\u2019s worth remembering that the point of those measures is to maximize people\\u2019s health and well-being. And maximizing health and well-being is not the same thing as minimizing Covid.\", \"If that sounds strange, remember that society would cease to function if it tried to minimize every medical risk. Schools and offices don\\u2019t close each winter because of the flu. Families travel in cars even though crashes harm vastly more children than Covid does. People jog, play sports and ride bicycles even though thousands end up in emergency rooms.\", \"The economic and social costs of our Covid precautions are real. In some cases, those precautions are clearly worth it \\u2014 and in other cases they\\u2019re not. Figuring out how to control the virus while addressing the other Covid-induced crises is one of the great challenges of the pandemic\\u2019s next phase.\", \"Journalists face hostile governments and digital disruption \\u2014 and need help, write Maria Ressa, a Nobel laureate, and Mark Thompson, The Times\\u2019s former chief executive.\", \"We often learn more from hard times than from happy ones, says David Brooks.\", \"Wake up: Inside a Gen Z conspiracy theory.\", \"Fast-Food Nation: Mariah Carey for McDonald\\u2019s, Justin Bieber for Tim Hortons \\u2014 it\\u2019s the era of celebrity-branded meals.\", \"Modern Love: Parents talk to their young sons about an unspeakable event.\", \"A Times classic: Which is healthier, sleep or exercise?\", \"Lives Lived: Demaryius Thomas, a former wide receiver for the Denver Broncos, played in the N.F.L. for 10 seasons. He died at 33.\", \"Lina Wertm\\u00fcller, the first woman nominated for an Oscar for directing, combined sexual warfare and leftist politics in films like \\u201cSwept Away\\u201d and \\u201cSeven Beauties.\\u201d She died at 93.\", \"The fandom of \\u201cSex and the City,\\u201d a show that ended 17 years ago, never really died. Instagram accounts breathlessly document the characters\\u2019 outfits, and the show still inspires people to move to New York City (or at least fantasize about it).\", \"Combine that with \\u201990s and early-2000s nostalgia \\u2014 in fashion and in sitcom reboots \\u2014 and the return of \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d seemed inevitable. \\u201cAnd Just Like That,\\u201d on HBO Max, premiered this week.\", \"The new version follows Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte, now in their 50s, though Kim Cattrall\\u2019s Samantha \\u2014 the source of much of the original show\\u2019s sex \\u2014 didn\\u2019t return. The show also features four new actors, and the cast is a contrast to the original show\\u2019s overwhelming whiteness.\", \"The spinoff has undergone other changes: Sarah Jessica Parker\\u2019s voice-over is mostly scrapped. Structurally, story arcs linger across episodes. Michael Patrick King, the showrunner of \\u201cAnd Just Like That,\\u201d recalled that when the show first aired, episodes tied up neatly because audiences might not have viewed them sequentially. \\u201cStreaming is like, untie the bow,\\u201d he said.\", \"The reviews are mixed. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a bit of an Unfrozen 1990s Caveperson vibe to it all,\\u201d James Poniewozik writes in The Times. The show \\u201cmay offer die-hard fans the closure that the movies didn\\u2019t \\u2014 if it doesn\\u2019t bum them out.\\u201d \\u2014 Sanam Yar, a Morning writer\", \"The combination of sweet fennel, bitter radicchio and salty anchovy in a salad is a winning one.\", \"Recommendations from two critics: Jason Farago on art, music and movies that evaded social media, and Maya Phillips on the culture that thrilled her inner fangirl.\", \"Generation-spanning albums that redefine holiday classics from Nat King Cole, Kelly Clarkson and more.\", \"The hosts commented on Tucker Carlson.\", \"How well did you keep up with the headlines this week?
