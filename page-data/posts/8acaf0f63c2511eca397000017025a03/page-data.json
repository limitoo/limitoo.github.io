Additionally, the video attracted tens of thousands of commenters who also voiced their love for the Bad Habits singer.\", \"\\\"I don't know who made the executive decision that we all hate Ed Sheeran, but you know what? I'm gonna stand my ground,\\\" Niccoya said at the beginning of the duet video. \\\"I like that lil leprechaun!\\\"\", \"Sheeran smiled and said, \\\"thank you,\\\" as Niccoya continued to praise the singer.\", \"\\\"The fact that y'all sit here and lie as if 'Photograph' ain't have you in a chokehold really blows my mind,\\\" Niccoya continued. Sheeran laughed as she said this.\", \"When Sheeran's Lego House begins to play in the background of her video, Niccoya yells: \\\"Cut it up, Ed!\\\" He thanked her again and the two sing for the remainder of the video.\", \"\\\"NOT ME AND ED SINGING TOGETHER,\\\" Niccoya said in the comments section of Sheeran's viral duet response.\", \"\\\"I'm on the next album y'all,\\\" she joked.\", \"She also shared the viral moment to her Twitter account, where it has received more than 1 million views.\", \"Sadly, as Niccoya's video suggested, Sheeran is no stranger to hate.

What?\\\"\", \"But as the comments section of Sheeran's viral duet proved, he is still beloved by many.\", \"\\\"NO ED WE LOVE U bestie,\\\" said zoe.\", \"\\\"You literally make the best songs, HANDS DOWN,\\\" commented rolynn.solab.\", \"\\\"Naw...they be playing with you ed,\\\" said faith. \\\"You got them HITS.
