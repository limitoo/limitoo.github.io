The married father of two represents a coastal seat in southern metropolitan Sydney.\", \"A former Liberal state director and head of Tourism Australia, Morrison quickly rose through the political ranks and has been on the Liberal frontbench since 2008.\", \"If the Coalition loses the election, few expect Morrison to continue to lead the Liberal Party, with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Defence Minister Peter Dutton the likely candidates to replace him.\", \"Anthony Albanese arrived in the nation's parliament as John Howard rose to power after 13 years of Labor governments.\", \"He has spent just six of his 26 years in office on the government benches, and while he's no stranger to federal politics, he's spent the past year trying to reintroduce himself to the public.\", \"A former deputy prime minister during Kevin Rudd's second stint as PM, he has been on Labor's frontbench for more than two decades.\", \"Albanese lost a leadership ballot to Bill Shorten in 2013 but, after two lost elections, he finally got his chance to lead Labor in 2019.\", \"As leader, he has deliberately kept a low profile and insisted he would be \\\"kicking with the wind\\\" as the election loomed.\", \"But the Cold War winds blowing from Eastern Europe risk limiting Albanese's opportunities to differentiate himself from Morrison and also land political blows on a nine-year-old government.\", \"Some in Labor feared he was a creature of opposition and might not have what it takes to lead Labor from the political wilderness to government.\", \"But he capitalised on issues with the Covid-19 vaccine rollout and the availability of RATs to drive up his personal approval ratings and the political stocks of Labor.\", \"The son of a single parent, Albanese has talked often about how his upbringing in government housing shaped the politician he has become.\", \"Divorced and with one son, Albanese has a new partner and represents an inner-western Sydney electorate on the south side of the Parramatta River.\", \"Albanese rose to the leadership uncontested in 2019.
