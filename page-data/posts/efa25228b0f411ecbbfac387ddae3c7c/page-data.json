With her hands folded defiantly in court, former second year accounting student Sibongile Mani was sentenced to five years in prison Wednesday for stealing the funds from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme. \\u00a0\", \"A clerical error meant instead of a $96 monthly food allowance being deposited into her account, close to $1 million was transferred on June 1, 2017.\\u00a0\", \"Judge Twanette Olivier found Mani guilty of stealing the funds and slapped her with the prison sentence, and a stunning admonishment.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"You, and yourself, made the decision on June 1, 2017, and you did so repeatedly for 73 consecutive days, numerous times per day,\\\" the judge told Mani in court.\\u00a0\", \"Mani spent close to $1,000 a day on handbags, alcohol and clothing, racking up charges across the country before the fund noticed the error on August 13 and reported her.\", \"Other students from Walter Sisulu University claim they blew the whistle on Mani's scheme after growing suspicious of the sudden change in her lifestyle.
