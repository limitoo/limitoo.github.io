After the Lakota surrendered, the soldiers led them to an encampment. As the soldiers were disarming the Lakota, a shot was fired, and then the soldiers attacked.\", \"The massacre marked one of the bloodiest acts of violence against Native Americans by federal forces, and it was the last armed conflict between them.\", \"In its aftermath, the government looked into the conduct of the troops of the Seventh Cavalry \\u2014 and decided to award the medals, the nation\\u2019s highest military commendation, to the soldiers involved.\", \"Many of the award citations noted \\u201cgallant conduct in battle\\u201d and \\u201cdistinguished\\u201d or \\u201cconspicuous\\u201d bravery, with few details to justify those characterizations.\", \"To date, the nation has awarded more than 3,500 Medals of Honor, including about 400 to soldiers who fought in campaigns against Native Americans. About 900 awards have been rescinded, according to the Medal of Honor Society, most of which were bestowed during the Civil War. No medals awarded for service in battles against Native Americans have been revoked.\", \"Earlier this year, the South Dakota State Senate passed a resolution calling for Congress to investigate the awarding of the medals. Congress formally apologized for the massacre in 1990.\", \"Some of those who signed the letter also took part in a legislative push earlier this year. Ms. Warren; Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon; and Representative Kai Kahele, Democrat of Hawaii, led the reintroduction of the Remove the Stain Act, a bill that would revoke Medals of Honor from 20 United States soldiers who took part in the massacre at Wounded Knee. The bill was read twice and referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\", \"\\u201cThe atrocities against unarmed Lakota men, women, and children at Wounded Knee should be condemned, not glorified with our nation\\u2019s highest military honor. Congress should pass the Remove the Stain Act to right this wrong against Native peoples, but the President can and should also use his authority to revoke these wrongly conferred medals,\\u201d Ms. Warren said.\"]","href_hash":"cbc301283ce011ecaa55000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cbc301283ce011ecaa55000017025a03"}},
