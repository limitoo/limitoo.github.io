He visited infamous sites of the slave trade and toured thriving local businesses. And he celebrated Hanukkah with a fellow Brooklynite, about 5,000 miles from home.\", \"As New York City grappled with a spate of urgent challenges over the past week that will have lasting implications for the incoming mayoral administration, the mayor-elect, Eric Adams, was in Ghana, searching, he has said, for his roots on a \\u201cspiritual journey.\\u201d\", \"For many Black Americans, a visit to Ghana \\u2014 a country through whose ports millions of Africans passed on the brutal journey to plantations \\u2014 is a wrenching and moving experience. And Mr. Adams, slated to be New York City\\u2019s second Black mayor, has cast his recent trip there as proof of resilience and progress.\", \"\\u201cMy ancestors left Africa with slavery,\\u201d Mr. Adams declared at one recent event. \\u201cI\\u2019m coming home with the mayoralty. And if I do that only for my aspiration, then I failed those ancestors.\\u201d\", \"But after more than a week away, Mr. Adams has returned to a city that is confronting serious problems of public health and public safety, and a new, sweeping vaccine mandate that he must navigate.\", \"He must also jump-start a transition process that has, so far, lagged the pace set by his predecessor.\", \"Mr. Adams left town having made no appointments to his future administration \\u2014 in contrast to Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had announced roles including police commissioner, first deputy mayor and director of intergovernmental affairs by the end of the first week of December 2013.\", \"On Thursday, Mr. Adams officially announced his new choice for schools chancellor, David Banks, a sign his transition is accelerating. He opened the event with a direct rebuke of anyone who would question his trip abroad, including, he said, the \\u201ctabloids.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cPeople who criticize this, they just didn\\u2019t get it,\\u201d Mr. Adams said. \\u201cThey just didn\\u2019t get what my campaign represented to so many people in this city and in this country.\\u201d\", \"His team insists that he remained heavily engaged in transition work from Ghana. He also kept tabs on New York City politics as his top lieutenants waded into the City Council speaker\\u2019s race, a contest that has significant implications for Mr. Adams\\u2019s agenda and has become increasingly contentious.\", \"\\u201cThe mayor-elect worked continually throughout his trip, regularly talking with key advisers about the Omicron threat and other pressing issues, while preparing his new administration and planning for a number of major announcements on his return,\\u201d said Evan Thies, his spokesman.\", \"Few would begrudge Mr. Adams a postelection vacation or question the meaning of his trip to Ghana. But his visit came less than a month before he is to be sworn in to one of the most consequential jobs in the country, and some questioned the timing.\", \"\\u201cIt is very unusual,\\u201d said Maya Wiley, a former counsel to Mr. de Blasio and a civil rights lawyer, who ran against Mr. Adams in the June mayoral primary. \\u201cWhat I could say is that it surprises me that this was a trip that could not be taken after the primary, and that it is a very intense time for most new administrations coming into office.\\u201d\", \"The trip was largely closed to the press, which Mr. Thies defended by emphasizing the private nature of the journey \\u2014 but it was hardly a quiet resort retreat. Mr. Adams met with politically and civically prominent people, including a former president of Ghana and the mayor of Accra, the capital city, and delivered speeches of his own.\", \"Interviews with leaders in Ghana and a review of social media postings show that he spent significant time with the Heritage and Cultural Society of Africa Foundation, or HACSA, an organization that is focused on issues including promoting African heritage and building connections with the diaspora.\", \"The group is helmed by Johanna Odonkor Svanikier, a former Ghanaian ambassador to France and Portugal, who accompanied Mr. Adams on parts of his trip.\", \"\\u201cHACSA\\u2019s mission is to help members of the African diaspora return to their roots and learn about their history \\u2014 a mission that deeply resonated with the mayor-elect,\\u201d Mr. Thies said, asked how Mr. Adams was connected to the organization.\", \"Mr. Adams was the guest of honor at a celebration for the group, where he encountered officials like UNESCO\\u2019s Accra director, Abdourahamane Diallo.\", \"\\u201cWe discussed areas of possible cooperation in education, culture and heritage with the City of New York, from Heritage to the UNESCO\\u2019s program on cities,\\u201d Mr. Diallo said in an email, relayed through a spokeswoman.\", \"A news release from HACSA also said Mr. Adams pledged his support for an initiative designed to connect \\u201cdiaspora youth\\u201d with Africa.\", \"Mr. Thies said Mr. Adams paid for the trip himself, but said that as a matter of policy they would not provide receipts. Gabriella Lourie, a representative for the group, said HACSA did not fund the trip.\", \"Mr. Adams visited a range of sites of significant historical, economic and cultural importance to Ghana, and was joined on the trip by his partner, Tracey Collins. He spent time at the home of the civil rights leader and activist W.E.B. Du Bois and the surrounding complex, where Mr. Thies said the home\\u2019s caretakers added a tribute to Mr. Adams\\u2019s mother to a wall honoring Black leaders.\", \"\\u201cHe was deeply moved by that,\\u201d Mr. Thies said.\", \"Mr. Adams toured businesses that reflect the importance of goods like cocoa to the Ghanaian economy.\", \"And he received a new name \\u2014 Barima Yaw Asamani, a nod to a Black royal warrior \\u2014 as part of a traditional spiritual cleansing ceremony. The practice was undertaken because his ancestors were forced out of the country against their will, according to one of the elders involved.\", \"\\u201cHe is not the first person who has been cleansed and who has been renamed,\\u201d said Nana Semanhyia Darko, the spokesman for the chief of Akwamu state, who carried out the ceremony. \\u201cAfrican Americans have been visiting this place, and we have been renaming them.\\u201d\", \"A central part of Mr. Adams\\u2019s visit was a trip to the notorious slave forts of Cape Coast and Elmina Castles, and he stopped at the \\u201cDoor of No Return.\\u201d When President Obama made a similar stop in 2009, he said the experience illustrated \\u201cpure evil\\u201d and reminded him of a concentration camp.\", \"That experience \\u201cwas an emotional moment for the mayor-elect that gave him perspective on the importance of the challenges ahead for him as the city\\u2019s next leader,\\u201d Mr. Thies said.\", \"Mr. Adams was not made available for an interview to discuss those takeaways and other aspects of his trip.\", \"HACSA, however, offered a steady stream of updates on social media. One Instagram picture showed him standing near a canon at Cape Coast, wearing sunglasses and gazing at the sea with a somber expression.\", \"Another image showed him wearing colorful, flowing garb as he posed at a memorial site honoring Kwame Nkrumah, saluting the former leader of Ghana who was at the forefront of the nation\\u2019s battle for independence. He toured the site with Nkrumah\\u2019s daughter, Samia.\", \"\\u201cI think it\\u2019s good that our mayor is visiting Africa,\\u201d said Yaw Nyarko, a professor of economics at New York University who heads N.Y.U. Africa House and does work in Ghana. \\u201cNew York is a big city, I think it\\u2019s one of the few cities where the mayor actually has a foreign policy.\\u201d\", \"The professor noted the Ghanaian government\\u2019s work in encouraging tourists, in particular African Americans, to visit. Asked about Mr. Adams\\u2019s claim that the people of Ghana were awaiting his visit as they did Mr. Obama\\u2019s, he laughed.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a little bit unfair, Obama was the president, Adams is yet to be mayor; so without a doubt there\\u2019s a difference in level of name recognition,\\u201d he said. But, he added, \\u201cEverybody is anxious to see more connections between Ghana and New York.\\u201d\", \"One clear connection was on display early in Mr. Adams\\u2019s trip, when he showed up at a Hanukkah celebration hosted by Chabad. Rabbi Noach Majesky, the Chabad rabbi in Accra, is from Crown Heights in Brooklyn.\", \"He described Mr. Adams\\u2019s visit as \\u201ca Birthright type of trip.\\u201d\", \"The New York Post first reported on the Hanukkah visit. Mr. Adams was connected to the event by Ms. Svanikier\\u2019s husband, Thomas Svanikier, Chabad officials said.\", \"Wearing what appeared to be a light yellow dashiki shirt, Mr. Adams posed before a picture of a menorah, spoke of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh grand rebbe of the Lubavitch Hasidic movement whose base is in Crown Heights, and discussed the \\u201copen wounds\\u201d of the Holocaust and slavery, according to videos provided by Chabad of Ghana.\", \"\\u201cI came here to close the open wound of slavery and reconnect with my ancestors,\\u201d Mr. Adams said, speaking on a stage bathed in red light. \\u201cI\\u2019m happy to be here in Ghana with you, showing how great we are as a people.\\u201d\", \"An electric guitar riffed on the first few notes of \\u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\\u201d as another day for a mayor-elect abroad came to a close.\"]","href_hash":"e22f417c59a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e22f417c59a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}},
