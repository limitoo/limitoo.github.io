According to the Associated Press, a French naval ship had spotted bodies floating in the water of both deceased victims and injured survivors. So far, 31 people had died, two have survived, and one passenger is still missing.\", \"French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin visited the survivors in a Calais hospital, while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \\\"shocked, appalled and deeply saddened\\\" by the tragedy. The AP also said that Johnson had convened a crisis committee meeting to determine what to do next.\", \"The English Channel is considered to be one of the most dangerous ocean crossings in the world, while also being a regularly-suggested migrant path by traffickers. More than 25,700 people had crossed the English Channel this year--more than three times than in all of 2020. However, not everyone is able to make it to British shores; authorities have been rescuing thousands of immigrants in rescue missions over the past few weeks.\", \"\\\"How many more times must we see people lose their life trying to reach safety in the UK because of the woeful lack of safe means to do so?\\\" said Tom Davies of Amnesty International U.K. He serves as the organization's refugee and migrant rights campaign manager.\", \"\\\"We desperately need a new approach to asylum,\\\" he continued, \\\"including genuine Anglo-French efforts to devise safe asylum routes to avoid such tragedies happening again.\\\"\", \"The identities and nationalities of the passengers on board have not been released.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939842/wimereux.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">31 migrants died and others were injured November 24, 2021, when their boat capsized off Calais in the English Channel as they tried to cross from France to Britain, authorities said.
