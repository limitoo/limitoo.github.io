The Associated Press reported that representatives from those countries met at the Palais Coburg, the same hotel where the agreement was signed six years earlier.\", \"The original deal had Iran limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for the other countries lifting economic sanctions. The talks are aimed at bringing Iran back in compliance with the deal.\", \"The U.S. remains out of the talks due to the Trump administration's decision to leave the deal.
