It was one of several dust-ups between the candidate and the election workers that ended with his ballot jamming the scanning machine.\", \"At about that point I suddenly wondered: What if this guy wins? It was not an outcome most people had ever considered, for obvious reasons. But gee, the country was in such a foul mood, the status of the Biden administration so subterranean. The image of Congress wasn\\u2019t really much better than that apartment full of cats. What if, just to show their profound irritation, the voters went Sliwa?\", \"Didn\\u2019t happen. The winner, Eric Adams, a Democrat, is a former police officer who ran a smooth campaign about his plans for reforming crime-fighting in New York. Early results suggest Sliwa will be very, very lucky to get a third of the vote. I am sharing this because I know a lot of you need some happy political news to tell friends over the weekend.\", \"Some Possible Post-Election Conversational Strategies for Liberal Democrats:\", \"\\u2014 Find a few next-generation stars to burble over, even if they just got elected to your town\\u2019s zoning board of appeals.\", \"\\u2014 Funny stories about other cats.\", \"\\u2014 Ranting about Joe Manchin.\", \"Perhaps you noticed that, just before Election Day, Senator Manchin called a press conference to announce that he wasn\\u2019t sure he could support Joe Biden\\u2019s social services program because of his concern about the \\u201cimpact it\\u2019ll have on our national debt.\\u201d\", \"Given Manchin\\u2019s super-status as a Democratic swing vote, we certainly have to pay attention to his fiscal conservatism and obsession with the national debt. After we stop to muse \\u2014 just for a minute \\u2014 that his state, West Virginia, gets about $2.15 in federal aid for every dollar its residents send to Washington.\", \"But back to the positive side of the elections \\u2014 or at least the less-depressing-than-originally-perceived side. That big governor\\u2019s race in Virginia, won by the Republican, Glenn Youngkin, was maybe the worst blow of the evening for Democrats. But when you\\u2019re having those dinner table conversations \\u2014 or, hey, drinking heavily at a bar \\u2014 be sure to point out that the loser, Terry McAuliffe, is a former Virginia governor. His state seems to have a real problem with chief executives who hang around, and there\\u2019s a law that makes it impossible for a sitting governor to run for re-election. McAuliffe was trying for a comeback after his enforced retirement \\u2014 a feat that\\u2019s been achieved only once since the Civil War.\", \"Didn\\u2019t work. Will you be surprised to hear that Donald Trump is taking credit?\", \"The other governor\\u2019s race, in New Jersey, was way more dramatic than expected, with incumbent Philip Murphy fighting off a surprisingly strong challenge from Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman. Very possible this one could still be in recount purgatory during the holidays.\", \"I really hope Murphy, a rather fearless leader in the war against Covid, is not being punished for vaccine mandates and mandatory school masking, which Ciattarelli complained about endlessly. Or that the irritable voters wanted to get back at their governor for remarking, a few years ago, that if you\\u2019re a person whose only concern is tax rates, New Jersey is \\u201cprobably not your state.\\u201d\", \"Ciattarelli reportedly spent about $736,000 running that quote in a 10-day broadside of ads. But I\\u2019ll bet most New Jersey voters accept the governor\\u2019s view, however grudgingly. Almost all of them must have some state concerns besides taxes \\u2014 schools? Street lighting? The end of black bear hunting?\", \"Fortunately, you won\\u2019t be expected to argue that Tuesday was one of the great days in the history of American democracy. Otherwise, some detail-oriented colleague might mention that a House district near Columbus was won by the chairman of the Ohio Coal Association.\", \"Yeah, and Minneapolis failed to pass its public safety program. It seems that Seattle will end up with a new law-and-order mayor rather than criminal justice reform.\", \"On the other hand, there were loads of stories to remind you how our country, for all its multitudinous failures to live up to the American dream, still also manages to come through. A lot. Boston elected its first woman and first person of color as mayor. Pittsburgh and Kansas City, Kan., each elected its first Black mayor. Cincinnati chose an Asian American mayor, and Dearborn, Mich.\\u2019s next mayor is going to be an Arab American Muslim.\", \"Cheer up, people. We made it through another election. Take the holidays off from politics if you want. Just ignore the new flood of emails asking you to donate to some worthy candidate\\u2019s quest for a House seat in 2022. What\\u2019s the rush? You\\u2019ll hear from them again next week. And the week after that. \\u2026\"]","href_hash":"23933fac3d0511eca582000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"23933fac3d0511eca582000017025a03"}},
