A lawyer for Mr. Ramsey said the case was without merit and that the company has followed guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention throughout the pandemic.\", \"Mr. Amos, 45, said he was hired in 2019 as a senior video editor making $90,000 a year, then was fired in July 2020, after repeatedly telling his supervisors that he wanted to work from home to protect the health of his wife and son, in accordance with his own Christian beliefs.\", \"Mr. Ramsey\\u2019s company \\u201cterminated Plaintiff for taking scientifically prescribed precautions, as required by his sincerely held religious beliefs, in the Covid pandemic rather than relying on prayer alone to protect himself,\\u201d the lawsuit stated.\", \"\\u201cEmployees who wore masks to meetings were mocked and derided,\\u201d according to the lawsuit.\", \"Daniel Cortez, general counsel for Ramsey Solutions, described Mr. Amos\\u2019s claims as \\u201coutlandish\\u201d and said they had \\u201cabsolutely no merit.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe company has never looked down upon individuals who chose to either wear masks or become vaccinated,\\u201d Mr. Cortez said on Tuesday. He said he himself is vaccinated and regularly wears masks to the office. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very unfortunate that Mr. Amos has filed this lawsuit in federal court, but we are very confident that we will prevail.\\u201d\", \"He said that Mr. Amos was fired after he insulted a supervisor who had called a meeting with him to discuss his work, which had begun to suffer. Mr. Cortez said that Mr. Amos had told the supervisor that he was \\u201carrogant and not humble.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThat is a complete and utter lie,\\u201d said Mr. Amos\\u2019s lawyer, Jonathan Street. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an excuse they\\u2019re using because he wouldn\\u2019t kiss Dave Ramsey\\u2019s feet.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Ramsey, who preaches that people can become millionaires by living simply and spending thriftily, has a weekly audience of about 23 million people through his podcasts and radio and online presence, according to Ramsey Solutions.\", \"His advice, which he also describes in his best-selling books and in a nine-week course called Financial Peace University, is steeped in an ethos that paying off debt and saving money is both common sense and ordained by God.\", \"But more recently he has become known as a critic of restrictions intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed nearly 800,000 Americans since early 2020.\", \"Early in the pandemic, Mr. Ramsey, whose company employs more than 1,000 people, decried the shutdown and said \\u201clives were being harmed more\\u201d by such restrictions \\u201cthan by the actual virus.\\u201d\", \"In December 2020, his company threw a large, indoor Christmas party where employees were not required to wear masks, according to the Religious News Service, which also reported the filing of Mr. Amos\\u2019s lawsuit.\", \"On his show, Mr. Ramsey has advised people who did not wish to get vaccinated and were now facing termination to quit their jobs and said that \\u201conly the big companies that are optics concerned\\u201d were enacting \\u201cstupid\\u201d policies.\", \"According to his lawyer, Mr. Amos moved his family from California to Tennessee to work for Ramsey Solutions. He liked the philosophy Mr. Ramsey espoused and wanted to live in Williamson County, which has a large conservative and Christian presence, Mr. Street said.\", \"After the pandemic hit, Gov. Bill Lee of Tennessee issued a statement that \\u201cstrongly\\u201d discouraged gatherings of 250 people or more, according to the lawsuit.\", \"On March 15, 2020, Mr. Ramsey emailed employees to tell them there had been a confirmed case of Covid-19 in the office.\", \"That employee worked in Mr. Amos\\u2019s department, according to the lawsuit. The following day, employees were told they had to attend an \\u201con-site\\u201d meeting, where Mr. Ramsey announced that the company would not allow people to work from home, the complaint stated.\", \"\\u201cSpecifically in this 900-person meeting,\\u201d the complaint said, \\u201cMr. Ramsey stated that fear of working in the office because of Covid demonstrated \\u2018weakness of spirit.\\u2019\\u201d \", \"Mr. Amos told his supervisor he was worried about putting his wife and son at risk.
