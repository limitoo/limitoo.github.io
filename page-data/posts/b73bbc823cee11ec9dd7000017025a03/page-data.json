The post also stated that most survivors of these schools had already \\\"forgiven\\\" what had gone on.\", \"Beyond sharing the post, Cobb also added the caption \\\"I think we need to look at every side of everything,\\\" in reference to the schools before deleting the post from his account.\", \"Cobb later apologized, but also blamed Indigenous groups for contacting the press about the incident instead of coming to him to talk about the issue.\", \"\\\"For those I offended, I apologize and I'm seriously sorry, very, very, sorry,\\\" Cobb said in an interview with CBC News. \\\"We could've probably solved a lot of problems, solved a lot of heartbreak, if the decision hadn't had been made to go to the press prior to even contacting me.\\\"\", \"\\\"Anyway, it is what it is...hopefully, we can move on,\\\" he continued.\", \"Despite the apology, though, the leaders of the First Nation have continued to call for Cobb to step down.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1925839/residential-school-canada.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The mayor of Williams Lake has been asked by Canadian First Nation groups to resign in the aftermath of an offensive Facebook post regarding residential schools.

It lacked substance and sincerity, and again we hear it in his interview this morning, blaming the Williams Lake First Nation for getting him into this uncomfortable situation.\\\"\", \"\\\"We would love to see the mayor of Williams Lake step down from his position, to open up that space for somebody who is more open-minded to the process of reconciliation,\\\" Sellars continued.\", \"Terry Teegee, the regional chief of the British Columbia Assembly of First Nations, also spoke out, stating that \\\"I think, ultimately, it does come down to a willingness to understand and have empathy for Indigenous peoples...so I don't know how many more chances that mayor will have...I don't think people will tolerate this anymore.\\\"\", \"In place for over 100 years, residential schools were run by the Canadian government as boarding institutions for Indigenous groups. It has been estimated that over 150,000 native students were forcibly placed into these schools throughout its history.\", \"The government-run Truth and Reconciliation Commission referred to the implementation of these residential schools as \\\"cultural genocide,\\\" with the main purpose of the schools being to segregate Indigenous children and help assimilate them into the lifestyles of white Canadians.\", \"The Commission stated that children at these schools often endured physical and sexual abuse, as well as the trauma of being taken from their families. Many of these children would reportedly go on to suffer from PTSD and a variety of substance abuse issues.\", \"Many deaths were also attributed to residential schools, with the number of children that perished currently estimated from 3,000 to 4,000.
