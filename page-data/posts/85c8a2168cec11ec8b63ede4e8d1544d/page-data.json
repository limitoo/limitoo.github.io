It\\u2019s there that she meets Max, a not-quite-yet-divorced man who is more than a decade her senior. Charming though slightly mean (in a flirtatious way?), Max works in finance and takes her to fancy meals.\", \"What ensues is almost so predictable as to not be: Max, with his expense account, his shiny high-rise flat with a view of the city and his weekend house in Oxford to which she\\u2019s not invited, makes clear that they are just \\u201chaving fun.\\u201d And Anna, his \\u201cdark-eyed bohemian,\\u201d as he calls her \\u2014 who initially agrees to the fun thing, of course \\u2014 falls in love. The power dynamic between them, unaligned from the start, becomes gaping as he persuades her to abandon her studies to spend more time with him. He starts giving her money and she, once so committed to her art, starts to lose what little independence she\\u2019d found.\", \"Anna, it turns out, is not so much \\u201cnice\\u201d as she is unformed. She is also: na\\u00efve, insecure, full of self-doubt, but also talented, trying to find her way in a place where she feels like an outsider among her wealthy classmates and shaping herself into the person she thinks Max wants her to be. \\u201cGod, why am I being so boring?\\u201d she worries of their conversations. \\u201cI would do anything he wanted,\\u201d she thinks during sex.\", \"Like her protagonist, Crimp briefly studied to be a singer at a London conservatory, which may explain why passages set in this milieu are the ones where her writing \\u2014 and her protagonist \\u2014 find their strength. Onstage, Anna is confident and brave, even \\u201cinvincible,\\u201d feeling like \\u201cevery nerve in my body was alive.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI liked that I could do something that made other people scared,\\u201d she recalls of finding her voice. \\u201cI liked discovering that I \\u2014 who teachers often had to ask to repeat my answer several times, my voice was so quiet \\u2014 could fill a room with sound.\\u201d\", \"There are plenty of stories these days about what it is to be a woman observed by the \\u201cmale gaze.\\u201d It\\u2019s a phrase Anna and her friends would no doubt use, if the at-times heavy-handed dialogue about tampons as \\u201ccapitalist,\\u201d or Latin as the \\u201clanguage of the patriarchy,\\u201d is any indication. (Anna\\u2019s roommate is writing a book she describes as a \\u201cfeminist deconstruction of the relationship between men and women in the internet age.\\u201d)\", \"But Anna is not only an object of that gaze; she actually starts to mold herself into it \\u2014 beginning to see herself, interpret herself, value herself, through how she perceives Max perceiving her.\", \"\\u201cLooking at myself naked in the mirror, I\\u2019d try to see it how he would,\\u201d she says.\", \"\\u201cI felt he was studying me too closely, appraising my worth, like I was a piece of jewelry he was considering buying.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI craved his look, and when I was away from him, I missed it.\\u201d\", \"In some of these moments, \\u201cA Very Nice Girl\\u201d is an all-too-real reminder of what it is to be a woman in your 20s, searching for who you are, trying on identities or stuck in a complicated pseudo-relationship even when you know you shouldn\\u2019t be. It\\u2019s a book about assessing your worth through other people\\u2019s eyes \\u2014 parents, friends, a lover \\u2014 and about being observed: by an overprotective mother, by men on the tube, by those who assess her auditions, by classmates competing for her slot, and ultimately by the audience. And yet, for the strength of Crimp\\u2019s writing, it might have benefited from a less predictable plot. Vulnerable young woman alone in a new city, seduced by an older, richer man who turns out to be kind of a jerk \\u2026 readers may be disappointed to find there\\u2019s no real twist here \\u2014 unless, of course, you count that Anna must lose the guy to get herself back.\"]","href_hash":"85c8a2168cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"85c8a2168cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}},
