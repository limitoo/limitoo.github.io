All three were convicted.\", \"The efforts, which employed the services of PR consultant Jevan Goulter, became known as \\\"the Gold Coast plot\\\" because the scheme occurred at the five-star Palazzo Versace hotel in Australia in late May 2017.\", \"At Yikar's sentencing in 2021, where he was given 12 months' home detention, Foote said it was an \\\"elaborate, outrageous and cynical plan\\\" to prevent Wallace from facing justice.\", \"He said Yikar was a \\\"key participant in the plot\\\" and met with Goulter before the scheme and inquired about costs.\", \"Payments - in all totalling $56,000 - were made to Goulter, either directly from accounts linked to Wallace or via an entity associated with Yikar.\", \"The plot failed and the victim told police about the approach.\", \"After returning to Auckland, Yikar met with Goulter and his business associate Allison Edmonds at Family Bar on Karangahape Road.\", \"Edmonds recorded the unfiltered and explosive conversation as the group discussed the ongoing conspiracy.\", \"At Yikar's sentencing, Justice Geoffrey Venning said if there was any doubt about Yikar's involvement as the middleman it was confirmed at the meeting.\", \"Yikar, who confirmed during the recording he was acting on behalf of Wallace, said if the victim had a \\\"comprehensive hold on reality\\\" they would accept a reasonable offer.\", \"When talking about Wallace, Yikar said: \\\"The only thing that pisses him off and makes him get cold feet is when he feels like it's a slippery slope and it won't get a resolution.\\\"\", \"Yikar said Wallace was \\\"happy to bleed if it gets resolved\\\".\", \"\\\"But he's like thinking, it's never getting resolved, I'm just going to keep bleeding and we're going to end up in court with everyone knowing.\\\"\", \"Yikar, who has Turkish heritage, also mentioned a seemingly joking conversation he had with Wallace about sending the victim to Turkey to have him killed.\", \"\\\"... you know, we going to put you in Istanbul, traffic accident, Gypsies there are cheap man, they do [it] for two hundred US, you know like, we jokingly talked about it, [the businessman] laughed and was like, 'this is not funny', so, I don't know,\\\" he said.\", \"Both Goulter and Edmonds were granted immunity from prosecution by the Solicitor-General in exchange for their evidence.\", \"Yikar had been granted interim name suppression in the District and High Courts on the basis that identifying him would identify Wallace.\", \"In his bid for ongoing suppression, the court judgement explained that Yikar said his mother, who has been working in Turkey since November 2022, was concerned that publishing her son's name would \\\"potentially have an adverse effect on her because of the shame that she would suffer through persons in Turkey learning about Mr Yikar's conviction\\\".\", \"Wallace, who is one of New Zealand's most prominent arts patrons and had an estimated net worth of about $170 million, is serving a two year and four month prison sentence after being found guilty of assaulting three men in the early 2000s, 2008 and 2016, and twice attempting to pervert the course of justice.\", \"His appeals have been dismissed and the government has begun the process of stripping him of his knighthood.\", \"Mika pleaded guilty to two charges of attempting to dissuade the victim and was sentenced to 11 months' home detention.\", \"* This story originally appeared in the New Zealand Herald.\"]","href_hash":"ee3069b2215411ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ee3069b2215411ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
