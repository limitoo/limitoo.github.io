I then did the 470 nationals and it just came back. It was like I had never been away. I thought, 'I can do that, I've got that in my pocket', but the appeal of a new class and having to learn everything from scratch is really what drives me.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"4f97eab485dd11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4f97eab485dd11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
