Australia's public health system.\", \"According to\\u00a0Australian Medical Association's president, Omar Khorshid, the hospital system\\u00a0showed some improvements during COVID-19, when patient levels dropped, but \\\"not to the level we thought it should be\\\".\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"And, he said, it was\\u00a0about to get \\\"much worse\\\".\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Public hospitals [today] are in a

the state of emergency departments, elective surgeries and public hospital funding across the country.\\u00a0\", \"Dr Khorshid said the AMA report's\\u00a0key finding was the time it took for

cuts,\\u00a0having a major fracture or severe hypertension,\\u00a0you have a one-in-three chance of being seen within 30\\u00a0minutes in the ACT and [about] a one-in-two chance in South Australia and

trend of 3.2 per cent year-on-year growth over the previous five years.\", \"Dr Khorshid said that drop was attributed to the COVID-19 lockdowns.\\u00a0\", \"But, he said, the data showed that no
