The animals\\u2019 bodies seem slightly out of proportion, with overly long legs, unusually broad heads and sharply pointed snouts. And then there is their fur, distinctly reddish in hue, with white patches on their muzzles.\", \"The Galveston Island canids are not conventional coyotes \\u2014 at least, not entirely. They carry a ghostly genetic legacy: DNA from red wolves, which were declared extinct in the wild in 1980.\", \"For years, these genes have been hiding in plain sight, tucked away in the seemingly unremarkable animals that scavenged for food behind housing developments and roamed the grounds of the local airport.\", \"Their discovery, which came after a determined local resident persuaded scientists to take a closer look at the canids, could help revive a captive breeding program for red wolves and restore the rich genetic variation that once existed in the wild population.\", \"\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t seem to be lost any longer,\\u201d said Bridgett vonHoldt, an evolutionary biologist at Princeton University, referring to the genetic diversity that once characterized red wolves. \\u201cWe might have a chance to bring it back.\\u201d\", \"Ron Wooten, a Galveston resident, never paid close attention to the local coyotes until they ran off with his dog one night in 2008. \\u201cA pack took him and carried him off,\\u201d recalled Mr. Wooten, an outreach specialist at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\", \"He found the pack, and what remained of his dog, in a nearby field. He was horrified, and he blamed himself for his dog\\u2019s death. But as his flashlight swept over the coyotes\\u2019 red muzzles, he found himself fascinated.\", \"Determined to learn more, he posted a message on Facebook asking his neighbors to alert him if they spotted the animals. Eventually, a friend came through: There was a pack near her apartment building.\", \"Mr. Wooten raced over with his camera, snapping photographs as he watched a group of pups chasing each other. \\u201cThey were just beautiful,\\u201d he said.\", \"But when he looked more carefully at the photos, he began to wonder whether the so-called coyotes were really coyotes at all. \\u201cThey just didn\\u2019t look right,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI thought at first that they must have bred with Marmaduke or something because they had super-long legs, super-long noses.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Wooten, a former fisheries biologist, started reading up on the local wildlife and stumbled across the history of red wolves. Once abundant in the southeastern United States, the wolves had dwindled in number during the 20th century \\u2014 a result of habitat loss, hunting and other threats.\", \"In the 1970s, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service made a last-ditch effort to save the species, traveling along the Gulf Coast and trapping all the red wolves it could find. Scientists selected some of the animals for a breeding program, in hopes of maintaining the red wolf in captivity.\", \"Mr. Wooten became convinced that the creatures that had taken his dog were actually red wolf-coyote hybrids, if not actual red wolves.\", \"Eager to prove his hypothesis, he began looking for dead canids by the side of the road. \\u201cI was thinking that if these are red wolves then the only way they\\u2019re going to be able to tell is with genetics,\\u201d he recalled.\", \"He soon found two dead animals, collected a small patch of skin from each and tucked them away in his freezer while he tried, for years, to pique scientists\\u2019 interest.\", \"\\u201cSometimes they wouldn\\u2019t respond,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSometimes they\\u2019d say, \\u2018Yeah, that\\u2019s a neat animal. Nothing we can do about it.\\u2019 And, \\u2018They\\u2019re extinct. It\\u2019s not a red wolf.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Eventually, in 2016, Mr. Wooten\\u2019s photos made their way to Dr. vonHoldt, an expert on canid genetics.\", \"The animals in Mr. Wooten\\u2019s photos immediately struck her. They \\u201cjust had a special look,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd I bit. The whole thing \\u2014 hook, line and sinker.\\u201d\", \"She asked him to send his specimens, but there was a glitch: By then, he had lost one. So he packed up the skin tissue he could find and threw in the scalpel he had used to prepare the other sample, hoping that the scientists could extract DNA from it.\", \"\\u201cIt was just a really kind of lovely chaos,\\u201d Dr. vonHoldt said. (The scientists did manage to pull DNA from the scalpel, but Mr. Wooten later found the second sample and mailed that, too.)\", \"Dr. vonHoldt and her colleagues extracted DNA from the skin samples and compared it to DNA from coyotes, red wolves, gray wolves and eastern wolves. Although the two Galveston Island canids were mostly coyote, they had significant red wolf ancestry; roughly 30 percent of their genetic material was from the wolves, they found.\", \"\\u201cIt was a real validation, I think, to the people on the ground \\u2014 the naturalists and the photographers on the ground saying, \\u2018We have something special here,\\u2019\\u201d said Kristin Brzeski, a conservation geneticist who was a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. vonHoldt\\u2019s lab at the time. \\u201cAnd they do.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Wooten was thrilled. \\u201cIt blew me away,\\u201d he said.\", \"Even more remarkable, some of the genetic variants, or alleles, the Galveston animals carried were not present in any of the other North American canids the researchers analyzed, including the contemporary red wolves. The scientists theorize that these alleles were passed down from the wild red wolves that used to roam the region.\", \"\\u201cThey harbor ancestral genetic variation, this ghost variation, which we thought was extinct from the landscape,\\u201d Dr. vonHoldt said. \\u201cSo there\\u2019s a sense of reviving what we thought was gone.\\u201d\", \"The researchers suspect that some red wolves evaded the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service dragnet back in the 1970s. \\u201cThere was surely a little slippery one that got away, or a couple,\\u201d Dr. vonHoldt said.\", \"At some point, the red wolves or their descendants bred with local coyotes \\u2014 and not just in Texas. In 2018, the same year Dr. vonHoldt\\u2019s team published its findings, another group documented high levels of red wolf ancestry in wild canids in Louisiana.\", \"The findings could help scientists understand the genetic variation that once existed in wild red wolves and even resurrect it. \\u201cWe can start actually understanding what was the historical red wolf and think about reconstructing that animal,\\u201d said Dr. Brzeski, who is now at Michigan Technological University.\", \"In the late 1980s, some of the red wolves from the captive breeding program were released in North Carolina. But that experimental population has plummeted in recent years; officials estimate that fewer than 20 of the animals now patrol the Carolina coast. And all the red wolves alive today are descended from about a dozen animals, an extremely low level of genetic diversity that could further imperil the species.\", \"The hybrids raise new conservation possibilities. For instance, scientists might be able to restore genetic diversity by carefully breeding red wolves to hybrids with high levels of red wolf ancestry. Or they could use artificial reproductive technologies or gene-editing techniques to insert the ghost alleles back into red wolves, Dr. vonHoldt said.\", \"The findings also come as some scientists have begun rethinking the value of interspecies hybrids. \\u201cOftentimes, hybridization is viewed as a real threat to the integrity of a species, which it can be,\\u201d Dr. Brzeski said.\", \"One reason that the red wolf populations declined in the wild is because the animals frequently interbred with coyotes. But, she added, \\u201chere we have these hybrids that are now potentially going to be the lifeline for the highly endangered red wolves.\\u201d\", \"The discovery of hybrids in both Texas and Louisiana also suggests that scientists and officials may want to \\u201crefocus\\u201d their red wolf conservation efforts on those areas, said Lisette Waits, a conservation geneticist at the University of Idaho and co-author of the 2018 paper on the Louisiana hybrids.\", \"In addition to studying the hybrids, it might make sense to reintroduce captive-bred red wolves to those regions, where animals with red wolf genes still roam the landscape. \\u201cIt could completely change the direction of the red wolf recovery program,\\u201d Dr. Waits said.\", \"Dr. Brzeski, Dr. vonHoldt and their collaborators are now studying the hybrids in both Texas and Louisiana as part of the new Gulf Coast Canine Project.\", \"They are using GPS collars and wildlife cameras to learn more about the canids\\u2019 movements and behaviors, collecting fecal samples to analyze their diets, using genetic analysis to trace pack relatedness and collecting tissue samples from animals with the most red wolf ancestry. One goal, Dr. vonHoldt said, is to create a \\u201cbiobank set of specimens that could be used to help increase the genetic health of the captive red wolf population.\\u201d\", \"They are also hoping to learn more about how these red wolf alleles have persisted, especially in animals that live close to humans in a popular tourist destination. The island setting, which keeps the canids relatively reproductively isolated, is probably part of the explanation, but so is the \\u201clack of persecution,\\u201d Dr. Brzeski said, noting that the animals were not commonly hunted.\", \"Indeed, Mr. Wooten is not the only local resident who has taken an interest in the animals. The research team works closely with Josh Henderson, the animal services supervisor at the Galveston Police Department, and there is considerable community support for the canids.\", \"Steve Parker, a lawyer who grew up in the area, remembers hearing childhood stories about his relatives trapping red wolves. The Galveston canids have helped him connect with the older generations, many of whom have passed away. \\u201cI\\u2019d like to see something and maybe be able to touch something that was special to them,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Wooten, for his part, dreams of setting up an educational center devoted to teaching the public about the unique animals. \\u201cThe possibilities of what these animals hold down here is pretty valuable,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s the reason I pursued it, I think. I think God was thumping me on the head and saying, \\u2018Hey, I got animals here. Take care of \\u2019em.\\u2019\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"7f5884b86c7c11eca8dc1f37e034c768"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7f5884b86c7c11eca8dc1f37e034c768"}},
