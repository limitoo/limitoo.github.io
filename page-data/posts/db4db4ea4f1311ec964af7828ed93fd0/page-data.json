And an appreciation for irony is elusive.\", \"My flight took off nearly 16 hours ago from Johannesburg, where people were abuzz with the news of the discovery of a coronavirus variant that is spreading in South Africa.\", \"This variant has many mutations, in particular on the spike protein that helps it enter human cells, and is spreading relatively quickly around Johannesburg.\", \"South Africa\\u2019s National Institute for Communicable Diseases shared what it knew midday on Thursday, and before I even took off, Britain had banned flights from southern Africa. Europe apparently panicked while I was somewhere over the Sahara; by the time we landed, we were told we would not be permitted off the plane.\", \"The irony lies in the fact that I was in South Africa to report on the risk of variants emerging in countries with low vaccination coverage \\u2014 and on the impressive, multilayered approach South Africa is using to try to protect global public health. I spent time in the labs of the same scientists who, yesterday, made the announcement that has left me hostage with a planeload of strangers while \\u201cthe authorities\\u201d somewhere debate what to do with us.\", \"Everyone on this flight had to show proof of a negative Covid test; most, it seems, are fully vaccinated, as I am.
