We are looking ahead to what we expect to be a strong summer for EasyJet, with plans to return to near 2019 levels of flying. We can't wait to welcome more customers back on board,\\\" EasyJet CEO Johan Lundgren said in a statement at the time.\", \"Between March 28 and April 3, EasyJet cancelled 202 of its 3,517 flights scheduled to depart from the U.K., according to data provided to CBS MoneyWatch from Cirium, an aviation analytics company. By comparison, the carrier cancelled zero flights departing from the U.K. during the same period in 2019, before the pandemic.\", \"An EasyJet spokesperson attributed the increase in cancelled flights to \\\"higher than usual staff sickness levels\\\" due to a recent surge in COVID-19 cases across Europe.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"As a result, we have made pre-emptive cancellations so customers can be notified in advance of travel and are able to move easily onto alternative flights,\\\" the spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.\", \"According to Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and health economist, such flight cancellations were all but guaranteed once passengers and crew members took off their masks.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"So damn predictable \\u2014 UK govt drops restrictions, airlines like @easyJet drops masks ... and less than 2 weeks later ... huge spike in pilots and flight attendants out sick with #COVID19 unable to work, and 120 flights cancelled!

It might make more people stay home and bite the airlines,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"Widespread flight cancellations persisted through the first week of April, with U.K. airlines cancelling 769 flights \\u2014 or 4% of all scheduled flights \\u2014 between March 31 and April 7, according to Cirium.\\u00a0\", \"EasyJet cancelled 309 departing flights, accounting for 40% of cancellations from the U.K.\", \"United Airlines \\u2014 which scrapped hundreds of flights in December due to many crew members contracting COVID-19 as the Omicron variant spread over the holidays \\u2014 said it is not currently experiencing any disruptions related to employees being infected with COVID-19.\\u00a0\", \"Similarly, an American Airlines spokesperson said the carrier has \\\"not had any operational issues\\\" but that it is monitoring the situation closely.

Still, airlines in the U.S. are bracing for the a possible surge in COVID-19 cases as the Omicron BA.2 subvariant becomes dominant.\", \"\\\"There is risk we may see some of that in North America and it's all dependent on case rates,\\\" said Rob Morris, head of Ascend by Cirium, an airline analytics and consulting agency. \\\"But it will be relatively short-term because airlines will adjust their capacity to manage demand and protect their network integrity.\\\"\", \"Although staffing shortages related to rising COVID-19 rates in Europe are disrupting other sectors, they're particularly acute in the airline industry.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's very clear that the airline industry is particularly vulnerable, and this creates a cascading effect on society more than, say, a restaurant closing would,\\\" Feigl-Ding said. \\\"This is critical infrastructure and these are essential employees, and we're endangering our economy.
