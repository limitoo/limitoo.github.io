neglect in two of its group homes.\", \"Life Without Barriers (LWB) fronted the disability royal commission to answer questions yesterday after four days of evidence from residents and their families.\", \"In one case, a female resident in a Melbourne home was hit over the head with a chair by another resident three times, and did not receive proper medical care for a fractured finger for five days.\", \"At another home in Lismore, in northern NSW, a female resident was allegedly indecently and sexually assaulted by a support worker.\", \"LWB\\u00a0operates disability services around Australia and New Zealand and its revenue exceeded\\u00a0$750 million last year.\", \"Chief executive officer Claire Robbs apologised to each of the residents and their families who had shared their stories.\", \"\\\"The views and experiences of people and their families have highlighted several areas where harm has been caused to people and we acknowledge and offer our deepest regret,\\\" Ms

cerebral palsy and a moderate intellectual disability.\", \"The 32-year-old is a wheelchair user and is mostly non-verbal.\", \"Her mother, Jennifer*, told the hearing that when Natalie entered the home in early 2012 she requested all her daughter's personal care, such as\\u00a0bathing, be done by female carers only, a request she believed was agreed to by LWB.\", \"She said her daughter seemed \\\"scared\\\" of the support workers.\", \"In 2015, staff contacted Jennifer to inform her a police investigation was underway after a male support worker allegedly indecently assaulted Natalie while\\u00a0performing personal care.\", \"He was charged with aggravated indecent assault of a person with physical disability and sexual intercourse of a person with cognitive impairment.\", \"The man was found not guilty at a jury trial in September 2017.\", \"After the incident, Jennifer told the inquiry there were meetings to discuss Natalie's safety and care where LWB staff became \\\"very aggressive\\\".\", \"\\\"LWB's failure to have women only attending Natalie's personal care enabled the assaults on my daughter to occur,\\\" Jennifer said.\", \"The inquiry was told\\u00a0LWB had not apologised to Natalie nor Jennifer for the assaults, nor for the fact that there was a male support worker delivering personal care.\", \"<img
