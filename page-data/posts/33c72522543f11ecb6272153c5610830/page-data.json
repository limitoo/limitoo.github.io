But every so often, a group would rouse and burst into a dance of orange confetti.\", \"One family mused on the inner lives of the butterflies. A couple watched in awe, silent. Another man called a friend by video to share the magic. He told him of how they just \\u201cflutter through.\\u201d\", \"Monarch butterflies make among the most impressive migrations of any species, flying hundreds of miles from various parts of the United States to Mexico and coastal California, where the Western population overwinters. But in the past several decades, their populations have plummeted because of global warming, development and farming practices, leading scientists to fear that the migratory population could ultimately become extinct.\", \"\\u201cMonarchs are a harbinger of what\\u2019s going on with many species,\\u201d Karen Oberhauser, a conservation biologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, told me by phone. She has studied the monarchs for more than 35 years.\", \"This year, however, the butterflies\\u2019 Western population has made a modest recovery, surprising scientists. Across California\\u2019s coast, onlookers have gathered at groves to witness the phenomena. Amid dire news about climate change and after close to two years of pandemic life, the butterflies\\u2019 arrival has offered a reprieve.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s like an escape,\\u201d Chris Messer, 30, said as he gazed up at the insects. \\u201cYou get to see the brilliance of this orange dance in the sky.\\u201d\", \"Clara Howley, who had traveled 170 miles from Santa Rosa to see the butterflies with her sister, said she was spellbound. \\u201cWe get so wrapped up in our lives; it\\u2019s nice to see the monarchs still wrapped up in theirs,\\u201d she said, adding, \\u201cI just can\\u2019t look away.\\u201d\", \"It is a marvel: The Western monarchs, each one weighing less than a paper clip, embark on their athletic feat from west of the Rocky Mountains. Much of how they migrate is still a mystery, but scientists believe they most likely rely on environmental cues, including sunlight and temperature. Several generations of butterflies are born and die before the journey is complete.\", \"But why are they rebounding? That, experts say, remains unclear.\", \"It could simply be that the butterflies had an especially good breeding season (insects can reproduce rapidly, and their populations do tend to fluctuate), or that especially warm fall weather last year changed the butterflies\\u2019 breeding and migration behavior, throwing off the count.\", \"The current numbers, however, are still a far cry from previous population totals: In the 1980s, millions of monarchs flocked to California for the winter. In 2017, an annual count found about 200,000 butterflies. Last year, the same count found fewer than 2,000.\", \"\\u201cI was really saddened,\\u201d Oberhauser told me, adding that she had worried \\u201cwe might be seeing the end of an incredible migratory phenomenon.\\u201d\", \"But the rebound, she and others say, is cause for cautious optimism. This year, volunteers have already counted more than 100,000 butterflies, according to the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s close to miraculous,\\u201d said Paul Meredith, 77, a volunteer with the butterfly sanctuary, who that Sunday was seated \\u2014 binoculars around his neck, insect pin in his cap \\u2014 among the trees.\", \"But, he added, \\u201cthere\\u2019s a lot of things we don\\u2019t understand.\\u201d\", \"To see the magnificent butterflies, visit these groves:\", \"Livia Albeck-Ripka is a reporter for The New York Times, based in California.\", \"Cheesy baked pumpkin pasta with kale.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes from Brice Yocum, who recommends the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.
