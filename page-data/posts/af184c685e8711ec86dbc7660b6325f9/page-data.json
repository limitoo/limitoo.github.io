The comment came as he and former Trump adviser Jason Miller discussed the upcoming 2022 midterms as well as the presidential election in 2024.\", \"\\\"I would say as far as Biden, I don't see any way that he stands for re-election in 2024,\\\" Miller, the CEO of Gettr who served on Trump's 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, told Bannon. He predicted that Democratic \\\"elites\\\" would tell Biden he needs to step aside after the 2022 midterms. He projected that Republicans will win big in those races.\", \"\\\"Best-case scenario for Democrats is that Republicans have a 60-seat landslide. I'm even hearing things like a historic 90-, even 100-seat, landslide\\u2014one of the biggest, if not the biggest in history,\\\" Miller said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1953158/steve-bannon.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon is predicting a Republican landslide in the 2022 midterms.

Barrett Prettyman Federal District Courthouse in Washington, D.C., on November 15.</div>\", \"Bannon quickly responded, \\\"Yeah, 100 seats, we reign for 100 years. I gotta tell you, this is the key.\\\"\", \"Trump formally pardoned Bannon right before he departed office in January. The former president's ally had been charged with fraud related to a crowdfunding campaign he launched in an effort to fund a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. Bannon was then indicted last month for criminal contempt of Congress after he refused to comply with a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\", \"Bannon, like many other Trump loyalists, has become a key promoter of the former president's baseless theory that the 2020 election was \\\"rigged\\\" or \\\"stolen\\\" in favor of President Joe Biden. He has regularly promoted the claims on his War Room podcast while also touting pro-Trump Republicans' efforts to take back control of Congress and the White House.\", \"\\\"This is Trumpism in power. That's when we went to the 4,000 shock troops we have to have that's going to man the government,\\\" Bannon said during an episode of his podcast earlier this month. He called on Trump supporters to prepare to take control.\", \"\\\"Get them ready now. Right? We're going to hit the beach with the landing teams and the beachhead teams and all that nomenclature they use when President Trump wins in 2024\\u2014or before,\\\" he said.\", \"Historical precedent and recent polling suggest that Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, and possibly the Senate, during the 2022 midterms. The party of the president in power generally loses a significant number of seats in Congress during the midterms of their first term. Because the Democrats control the House and Senate only by the narrowest of margins, even just a few seats flipping in Republicans' favor would shift the balance of power in the legislative chambers.\", \"Polling conducted this month by CNBC found that Republicans are preferred by voters over Democrats, by a double-digit margin, to control Congress. While just about a third (34 percent) of respondents said they prefer Democrats controlling the legislative branch, 44 percent said they prefer Republicans. That's a 10-point lead for the GOP less than a year before the midterms will take place.\", \"Meanwhile, Trump continues to tease the possibility of a presidential run in 2024\\u2014although he has not announced his intentions. Biden has said that he plans to seek another term. But with a sagging approval rating and concerns about his age (79), many political observers speculate that the president will step aside and let another Democrat run in 2024.\"]","href_hash":"af184c685e8711ec86dbc7660b6325f9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"af184c685e8711ec86dbc7660b6325f9"}},
