One hostage was released unharmed six hours later.\", \"Reporters said they heard the sound of explosions, possibly flashbangs, and the sound of gunfire shortly before Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced the crisis was over.\", \"\\\"Prayers answered. All hostages are out alive and safe,\\\" Abbott said on Twitter. The FBI said they have confirmed the identity of the gunman but said they would not yet disclose it. The FBI declined to confirm the cause of his death, saying it was still under investigation.\", \"Britain's foreign office confirmed the death of a British man in Texas, when asked to respond to a Sky News report that the gunman was a British national.

FBI negotiators soon opened contact with the man, who said he wanted to speak to a woman held in a federal prison.\", \"No injuries were reported among the hostages.\", \"In the first few hours, the man could be heard having a one-sided conversation in what appeared to be a phone call during a Facebook livestream of the service of the Reform Jewish synagogue in Colleyville, which is about 16 miles (26 kms) northeast of Fort Worth. The livestream cut off around 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT).\", \"Before the livestream was ended, the man could be heard ranting and talking about religion and his sister, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. The man could be heard repeatedly saying he did not want to see anyone hurt and that he believed he was going to die, the newspaper said.\", \"President Joe Biden, who was briefed on the crisis as it unfolded, praised the \\\"courageous work\\\" of state, local and federal law enforcement in freeing the hostages.\", \"\\\"There is more we will learn in the days ahead about the motivations of the hostage taker. But let me be clear to anyone who intends to spread hate \\u2014 we will stand against anti-Semitism and against the rise of extremism in this country,\\\" he said in a statement.\", \"Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said he was praying for the safety of the hostages.\", \"Barry Klompus, a member of the congregation since it opened in 1999, said he tuned into the livestream.\", \"\\\"It was horrible listening and watching,\\\" Klompus said in a telephone interview.\", \"A U.S. official briefed on the matter told ABC News the hostage-taker had claimed to be the brother of Pakistani neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui, who is serving an 86-year U.S. prison sentence for her 2010 conviction for shooting at soldiers and FBI agents, and that he demanded she be freed.\", \"Siddiqui is being held at a federal prison in the Fort Worth area.
