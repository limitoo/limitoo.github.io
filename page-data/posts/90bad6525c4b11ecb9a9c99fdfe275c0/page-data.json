And, like many such gatherings, Chase\\u2019s was jeopardized by the pandemic: The seventh installment, Liza Lim\\u2019s \\u201cSex Magic,\\u201d premiered online last December.\", \"What a relief it was, then, to be back at the Kitchen on Friday for Part VIII of \\u201cDensity\\u201d \\u2014 one of the great musical undertakings of our time, a singular project by a singular artist on the messily ambitious scale of Wagner\\u2019s \\u201cRing\\u201d and Stockhausen\\u2019s \\u201cLicht.\\u201d The climax will be a 24-hour marathon concert, but until then, \\u201cDensity\\u201d is unfolding incrementally, with Chase as the North Star of her instrument\\u2019s ever-expanding universe.\", \"This latest performance \\u2014 dedicated to the composer Alvin Lucier, whose \\u201cAlmost New York\\u201d was featured in Part I, and who died recently at 90 \\u2014 opened with Lim\\u2019s \\u201cSex Magic,\\u201d in the form of the excerpt \\u201cThroat Song,\\u201d for ocarina and voice, blending and blurring the two in gentle polyphony.\", \"Lim\\u2019s piece was a reminder that, while \\u201cDensity\\u201d is, on paper, a mission to develop a modern solo flute repertory, it has in practice been much broader. Chase and her cohort of composers have made an encyclopedic embrace of the flute family \\u2014 especially in Marcos Balter\\u2019s \\u201cPan,\\u201d which constituted Part V \\u2014 and remained open to the ways in which the human body can produce sound, such as in Pauline Oliveros\\u2019s monodrama-like \\u201cIntensity 20.15: Grace Chase,\\u201d from Part III. Some works haven\\u2019t even been solos. (And some, it should be said, have been easier to respect than love.)\", \"The concerts are anything but straightforward. Friday\\u2019s came with a host of additional credits, including for Levy Lorenzo\\u2019s sound, Nicholas Houfek\\u2019s lighting and production design, Monica Duncan\\u2019s projections and Kelly Levy\\u2019s stage management. The reason was clear the moment Chase began to play Wang Lu\\u2019s \\u201cAftertouch,\\u201d which complements three types of flute with street noise, a club-worthy beat and videos, by Polly Apfelbaum, of spinning singing bowls. It seems like a lot, but the elements wove together naturally: the city\\u2019s restlessness; the dizzying video; Chase\\u2019s arpeggios, amplified and, through electronics, feeding one another in waves of sound that transformed into clashing ripples.\", \"If \\u201cAftertouch\\u201d courted dance, the low frequency of its beat rattling the rafters, then Ann Cleare\\u2019s \\u201canfa,\\u201d which followed, invited something like the opposite. Its title, according to the program notes, comes from the Irish word for \\u201ca disturbance in the elements,\\u201d and its baseline is deceptive stasis. Chase stood with her towering contrabass flute against the backdrop of a projected film landscape, by Ailbhe Ni Bhriain, of an Irish bog \\u2014 a site, Cleare says, of rich industrial and geological history.\", \"The video has the look of a still image, but Cleare\\u2019s score reveals that there is always more to a landscape than meets the eye. Accompanied by electronics, Chase sounded both of the earth and beyond it, shifting textures with tectonic patience and warping time. Quietly, but alarmingly, the image changes to another in which inky plumes erupt with increasing frequency; by the end, their slowly spreading tendrils begin to overtake the bog.\", \"Matana Roberts\\u2019s \\u201cAuricular Hearsay\\u201d countered Cleare\\u2019s muted intensity with piercingly loud extroversion. Written for flute, video and the option of collaborators, it uses a mixed-media framework that Roberts calls \\u201cEndless Score,\\u201d and is, the composer writes, \\u201ca visual and sonic exploration of the brains of the neurodiverse,\\u201d inspired by how they \\u201coperate in starts, stops, spurts.\\u201d Improvising from a set of instructions, Chase played no fewer than a half-dozen instruments, including slide whistles, percussion and panpipe, alongside Senem Pirler\\u2019s scene-stealing live electronics and against blazing projections.\", \"It\\u2019s a marvel that, after this rush of premieres, Var\\u00e8se\\u2019s original \\u201cDensity 21.5\\u201d had the freshness of a new discovery. But its inclusion also put a lot of pressure on the pieces that preceded it: Will they still have such an eager audience in 2136?\", \"And what about artists able to take them up? So much of \\u201cDensity 2036\\u201d has been written specifically for Chase, tailored to her nimble technique, vocal prowess and charismatic presence. Although each addition has been a gift, it will be even more impressive if these works break the trend \\u2014 all too common in new music \\u2014 of coming and going like the burst of breath that makes a flute sing.\"]","href_hash":"90bad6525c4b11ecb9a9c99fdfe275c0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"90bad6525c4b11ecb9a9c99fdfe275c0"}},
