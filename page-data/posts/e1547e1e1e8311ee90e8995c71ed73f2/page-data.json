And we have had to quit part-time jobs because we don't have the time. We still have to buy our own uniforms, pay for parking, petrol, everything.\", \"\\\"Being paid for some of those clinical placements, an 'earn as you learn' model like for apprentices, would be a really big help.\\\"\", \"Midwifery is a four-year degree that was shoehorned into a three-year timeframe in 2009 by the Midwifery Council, with the intention of producing more graduates more quickly.\", \"Massey University pulled out at that point, saying the three-year timeframe would compromise student welfare, and research requirements.\", \"The Midwifery Council told RNZ it did not \\\"dictate\\\" the delivery time of the programmes, which were \\\"defined by the individual schools\\\".\", \"As of this year, only Otago Polytechnic and the Ara Institute of Canterbury are sticking with the three-year degree.\", \"Auckland University of Technology, Waikato Institute of Technology and Victoria University all have four-year degrees.\", \"The current midwifery degree is 480 points, 4800 hours, which equates to a four-year degree. The relevant section from the standards states:\", \"3.4. The programme is a 480 point/credit (4800 hour) degree. A minimum of 50% or 2400 hours is clinical practice and at least 40% or 1920 hours is theory. At least 80% of the final year of the programme must be midwifery clinical practice.\", \"Marsters said AUT ran the three- and four-year degree programmes side-by-side for a couple of years, but moved to four years for everyone from this year.\", \"Cramming the course into three years backfired in its intention of producing graduates more quickly, she said.\", \"\\\"It was brutal, I don't think I could have done it. It didn't do our numbers any good, when you've got all the other complexities as well.\", \"\\\"Some said 'actually, I really want to catch my breath and have some wh\\u0101nau time as well'.
