Darkness had fallen onstage; the hero, Prince Tamino, and Papageno, the cheeky bird catcher, were lost.\", \"\\u201cPapageno,\\u201d Matthew Polenzani, who sings Tamino in the abridged, English-language, family-friendly \\u201cFlute\\u201d that opens the holiday season at the Met on Friday, called out at a recent rehearsal. \\u201cAre you still with me?\\u201d\", \"As he rotated past on a set piece, the tenor Rolando Villaz\\u00f3n, wearing Papageno\\u2019s lime-green long johns and backward baseball cap, answered in accented English, \\u201cI\\u2019m right here.\\u201d\", \"Coming from Villaz\\u00f3n, there was a note of defiance in saying that on the Met\\u2019s mighty stage. Though he was once one of the company\\u2019s brightest young stars, Friday marks his first performance there in eight years. Many \\u2014 him included \\u2014 assumed he would never appear at the Met again.\", \"\\u201cWe can call it a roller coaster,\\u201d Villaz\\u00f3n, 49, said in an interview. \\u201cA very bumpy career.\\u201d\", \"Plagued for much of the past 15 years by vocal problems and mental fears, Villaz\\u00f3n lost his consistency and his nerve. \\u201cEverything fell apart for him,\\u201d said Peter Gelb, the Met\\u2019s general manager. \\u201cAt least at the Met. He had some vocal setbacks\\u00a0and disappeared from our radar.\\u201d\", \"Villaz\\u00f3n had reconciled himself to the end of his career, but during the pandemic he stumbled across a new approach to singing \\u2014 and now believes he isn\\u2019t yet finished. Returning to the Met as Papageno, a role almost always sung by a lower voice, might still appear to be an admission of weakness: a tenor losing his high notes and scrambling to the safety of baritone territory.\", \"Not so fast.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not a baritone,\\u201d Villaz\\u00f3n said, noting that Mozart wrote the part for Emanuel Schikaneder, the \\u201cFlute\\u201d librettist, who was a famed actor and impresario but far from a traditional opera singer. \\u201cThere are some low notes that aren\\u2019t really for a tenor, like B flat. But they\\u2019re mostly in the harmony. The lowest when he sings alone is a C, which is very central.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s true, though: When Yannick N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin, the Met\\u2019s music director, asked him to sing Papageno for a recording in 2018, Villaz\\u00f3n at first demurred. \\u201cI mean, in terms of the character, I love the character,\\u201d he said, \\u201cBut, of course, baritone role, ta ta ta. \\u2026\\u201d\", \"In other words, people might take his casting as an admission that the voice that had brought him celebrity was in permanent retreat. It was a fear he soon got over.\", \"\\u201cTo be honest,\\u201d he said, \\u201cit\\u2019s been a long time since I am worried about what people think.\\u201d\", \"This is still a course few would have predicted when he rose, in the early 2000s, as a lyric tenor, boyish and ardent in \\u201cLa Boh\\u00e8me,\\u201d \\u201cRigoletto,\\u201d \\u201cLa Traviata\\u201d and \\u201cL\\u2019Elisir d\\u2019Amore\\u201d \\u2014 even if there was always a duskiness to his tone, allowing him to be convincing in, for example, the heavier title role of Offenbach\\u2019s \\u201cLes Contes d\\u2019Hoffmann.\\u201d A 2005 profile in The New York Times observed that Villaz\\u00f3n was being compared to Pl\\u00e1cido Domingo, at whose Operalia competition Villaz\\u00f3n got his big break in 1999.\", \"\\u201cThe voice, at this early stage,\\u201d the Times profile said, \\u201cweighs in on the light side but is tinged like Mr. Domingo\\u2019s with the dark shading of a baritone.\\u201d\", \"That summer, Villaz\\u00f3n and Anna Netrebko, also fast-rising at the time, created a sensation in Willy Decker\\u2019s spare, vivid staging of \\u201cLa Traviata\\u201d at the Salzburg Festival in Austria, and were swiftly anointed opera\\u2019s next onstage power couple.\", \"\\u201cHe seemed,\\u201d Gelb said, \\u201cto be the most exciting\\u00a0tenor in 2005, \\u201906.\\u201d In 2007, Villaz\\u00f3n and Netrebko were the stars of a gala celebration of the Met\\u2019s 40th anniversary at Lincoln Center.\", \"But while Netrebko\\u2019s career continued to skyrocket, calamity struck Villaz\\u00f3n: He began to crack on some high notes, a tenor\\u2019s lifeblood. Cancellations piled up, including a Live in HD broadcast of \\u201cLucia di Lammermoor\\u201d from the Met alongside Netrebko.\", \"A cyst was eventually discovered inside his vocal cords; after a delicate operation in 2009, he couldn\\u2019t speak for some time, let alone sing. He gingerly re-emerged on opera and concert stages, including a Met run of \\u201cEugene Onegin\\u201d in 2013. (\\u201cDespite some initial cautiousness in the first act, in which he sometimes sounded underpowered,\\u201d the Times review said, \\u201che sang with confidence and poise.\\u201d)\", \"\\u201cIt was for me very important to reestablish myself, to reposition\\u00a0as a tenor,\\u201d Villaz\\u00f3n said. But the long period of uncertainty and tweaks to his technique had left their mark, and he began to lose confidence in himself and his instrument.\", \"\\u201cAround 2015, 2016, that\\u2019s when I started to develop stage fright, because I was afraid of getting something else,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI was hitting nine out of 10 high notes. When you are in this business, and at this level, you hit 10 out of 10. They might not be all beautiful, but you hit all of them. If you\\u2019re not hitting one of those 10, you start thinking, Is this the one? And then you start hitting eight out of 10, and seven out of 10.\\u201d\", \"He worked with sports coaches, and tried taking a small amount of anti-anxiety medication before performances. That helped with his fear, but took away the internal fire that he felt fueled his best work.\", \"\\u201cHow do I stop it being hell to go on and perform?\\u201d he recalled thinking. He re-embraced the Baroque repertory that he had done earlier in his career under the conductor Emmanuelle Ha\\u00efm, moving away from the high notes that had turned perilously unreliable. Then he developed what he called \\u201cuncomfortable sensations,\\u201d even in the middle of his voice.\", \"In 2017, 10 years after headlining the Met\\u2019s 40th-anniversary gala, Villaz\\u00f3n dropped out a few days before his appearance at its 50th. He felt basically done: \\u201cI thought, Let me reach 50 and I can call it quits as a singer.\\u201d\", \"It helped that singing wasn\\u2019t all he was doing by that point. He had some success as a television personality, was directing productions and had been named the artistic leader of the Mozartwoche festival in Salzburg. He had even started writing novels.\", \"But he wasn\\u2019t yet ready to give up performing entirely, and discovered that acid reflux was causing his new round of problems. He had another operation, at the end of 2018, and slowly his vocal steadiness, though not his high notes, came back.\", \"Then, practicing during the pandemic, he hit a note \\u2014 an F \\u2014 and immediately knew something had shifted in the way he produced sound. Working with coaches, he revised his approach to his voice; even some of his older, higher-flying roles felt possible again.\", \"\\u201cThe way it feels, I\\u2019m entering the greatest moment of my career,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI have no ambitions. I don\\u2019t need to achieve, professionally, anything else. It\\u2019s all artistic achievements.\\u201d\", \"So his coming seasons will include Mozart\\u2019s Tito and Idomeneo; Edgardo in \\u201cLucia\\u201d; even Loge, the trickster fire god in Wagner\\u2019s \\u201cDas Rheingold,\\u201d which Villaz\\u00f3n was working on when he had his pandemic breakthrough.\", \"\\u201cI certainly plan to sit with him and discuss other roles\\u00a0with him,\\u201d Gelb said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want this to be a drive-by appearance. But it\\u2019s up to him, and what he feels comfortable with.\\u201d\", \"Papageno, then, is hopefully not the beginning of the end for Villaz\\u00f3n, but a delightful lark \\u2014 a part for which he doesn\\u2019t feel the need to apologize, and on which he can lavish his fascination with the figure of the clown.\", \"\\u201cThey never lose, they never die, and they never quit,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe clown goes on.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"97addb44590811ecaf9325e1fb32ccaa"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"97addb44590811ecaf9325e1fb32ccaa"}},
