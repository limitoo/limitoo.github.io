To engage in a human relationship. And this, as you can appreciate, is not easy in a video call.\\\"\", \"Others aren't so convinced of her well-being.

But she is definitely not safe, not well, and she's totally controlled by the Chinese authorities and nobody knows where she is being detained.\", \"\\\"And so the athletes, if they go to China\\u2013nobody can guarantee their safety.
