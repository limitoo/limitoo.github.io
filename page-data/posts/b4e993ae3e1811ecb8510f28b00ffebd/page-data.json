It is difficult to predict how exactly their decision will affect New York and a number of other states with similar laws.\", \"But legal experts said that is likely that New York will have to replace its current law with a less restrictive one that would allow more people to carry guns in public.\", \"\\u201cWe are likely to see New York be forced to rewrite its law,\\u201d said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in constitutional law and gun policy. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll have to wait until we see the court\\u2019s opinion before we know what\\u2019s constitutionally permissible.\\u201d\", \"The case before the court involves two petitioners from upstate New York, Robert Nash and Brandon Koch, both of whom had sought unrestricted licenses to carry handguns. Both received restricted licenses allowing them to carry firearms for the specific purpose of hunting and target shooting, and Mr. Koch was allowed to carry a gun to and from work.\", \"They were barred from unrestricted licensees because they did not meet New York\\u2019s standard of \\u201cproper cause,\\u201d which requires that a person demonstrate a heightened need to carry a handgun for self-defense.\", \"Their lawyers have argued that the restrictions were straightforwardly unconstitutional based on two relatively recent decisions made by the court that have reframed the way the Second Amendment is interpreted. The court now holds that the amendment protects an individual\\u2019s right to have a gun for certain purposes, including self-defense.\", \"Joseph Blocher, a Second Amendment expert at Duke University School of Law, said that a number of different outcomes were possible if the court were to overturn the New York law.\", \"In one scenario, New York could retain a degree of discretion over who receives a license to carry a concealed handgun, but would be compelled to lower its standards, he said. In another, New York and states with similar laws might simply have to grant licenses to carry handguns to all applicants who meet a certain set of yet to be determined criteria, as is true in a number of other states.\", \"New York politicians have expressed considerable concern about the case. On Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that it \\u201creally worried\\u201d him.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a little surreal that we have justices in Supreme Court suggesting that it would be great to have more and more people armed walking the streets of the city,\\u201d he said.\", \"The ruling is expected to come down after Eric Adams replaces Mr. de Blasio as mayor. Mr. Adams, who emphasized public safety as key to the city\\u2019s recovery during his campaign, said that limiting the state\\u2019s ability to regulate firearms \\u201cis a recipe for disaster.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe need fewer people carrying guns \\u2014 not more \\u2014 and the ability to keep our streets safe preserved, not reversed,\\u201d he said in a statement. \\u201cIf this law is eliminated in New York, police departments in New York City and across the state will have to immediately prepare for more shootings and need additional resources to prevent them.\\u201d\", \"Gov. Kathy Hochul said in an interview with NY1 on Thursday that she believed gun owners had rights, \\u201cbut those rights do not include walking around with a hidden gun.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI really hope that Supreme Court sees the wisdom of what we put in place,\\u201d she said.\", \"While most guns used in shootings in New York City are not owned legally, research has shown that the vast majority of crime guns are often purchased legally in states with less restrictive laws and smuggled into the city. Iesha Sekou, an anti-violence activist in Harlem, said that weakening gun laws would only make the problem worse.\", \"\\u201cLoosening gun restrictions is like pulling the thread out of the sweater,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt will make the work of gun reform and all of the things we fought for to make guns less available \\u2014 it will undo that work.\\u201d\", \"In New York City, police officials have expressed concern that illegal guns are increasingly finding their way into the hands of teenagers or being used to target them. Ms. Sekou recalled how, last week, she watched a 17-year-old boy die after he was shot in the chest in Harlem and consoled his mother after she arrived to the scene on West 132nd Street.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re going to see more of young people\\u2019s bodies bleeding out on concrete because we have looser gun laws,\\u201d she said.\", \"New York\\u2019s concealed carry gun law, the Sullivan Act, was first adopted in 1911 in response to a deadly rise in gun violence in public spaces. New York City had experienced a marked increase in homicides and suicides by gun violence at the turn of that decade, and Mayor William Jay Gaynor had been shot in the neck in 1910 in an assassination attempt in New Jersey.\", \"The law is being challenged at a time when cities throughout the state are again wrestling with a rise in gun violence, which arrived with the onset of the pandemic. In New York City, shootings rose to their highest level in a decade, and although they have begun decreasing in recent months, they remain well above prepandemic levels. Cities like Buffalo and Rochester are grappling with similar rises in gun violence.\", \"While lawyers said that New York was likely to pass the strictest gun regulations it could after the justices\\u2019 decisions, they said that key questions remained unanswered.\", \"\\u201cWhere will it be constitutional for the government to say, \\u2018You can\\u2019t bring guns here?\\u2019\\u201d said Eric Ruben, a professor at Southern Methodist University\\u2019s law school and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. \\u201cAt oral argument, it became clear that line-drawing exercise is going to be very challenging.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Winkler said that most of the justices had seemed to accept the idea that guns could be limited in sensitive places. He said the state was almost certain to aggressively regulate what constituted a sensitive place.\", \"\\u201cNo matter what happens in this case, New York is going to continue to try to restrict concealed carry in ways that anger gun rights enthusiasts,\\u201d he said. And if that comes to pass, one thing is almost certain, he said: \\u201cThere\\u2019s going to be more litigation in the future.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b4e993ae3e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b4e993ae3e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}},
