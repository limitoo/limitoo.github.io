Dixon, an architect who designed several other homes on the block, as well. It is within walking distance of College Avenue, the area\\u2019s main thoroughfare, where there are two large grocery stores, a Chicago-style pizza restaurant, a gastro pub and a See\\u2019s Candies shop. It is also an easy walk to the Rockridge BART station, where the train carries passengers into San Francisco in about 30 minutes.\", \"Size: 2,578 square feet\", \"Price per square foot: $696\", \"Indoors: The front yard reflects the Tudor style of the house, with low hedges wrapping around manicured grass and flowering trees. Beyond the arched front door is a foyer with hardwood floors. The hardwood continues into a sunken living room with large casement windows, a fireplace with a stone hearth and decorative ceiling beams.\", \"The dining room is also off the entry hall, but elevated slightly, with more casement windows, a wrought-iron ceiling fixture and a door to the kitchen, where the standout feature is a fully restored white-enamel O\\u2019Keefe and Merritt stove.\", \"From one side of the kitchen, steps lead down to a bright studio that the sellers use as a crafts room. On the other side of the kitchen is a door to a breakfast room with an original built-in china cabinet and windows that look out over the side yard.\", \"A short corridor connects the dining room to the primary bedroom, windowed on three sides, with a deep closet that has its original crystal doorknob. Next door is a bathroom with well-maintained 1930s tile in a lavender-and-green color scheme.\", \"Across the hall are stairs to the upper levels of the house. Halfway up the staircase is a guest room that could comfortably hold a full-size bed and desk. At the top of the stairs are two more guest rooms, one with a view of the property\\u2019s palm trees and the other with an attached bonus room that could serve as a home office or a nursery. They share a windowed bathroom off the hallway with a stall shower.\", \"Outdoor space: Both the kitchen and the living room have access to a backyard with tall hedges around the perimeter and a mix of trees and flowers planted along the edges of the lawn. A canopy covers a paved patio big enough to hold a dining table, and the detached garage holds one car.\", \"Taxes: $22,440 (estimated)\", \"Contact: Perry Riani, Compass, 510-813-3799; compass.com\", \"Jack Corey, a U.S.C.-trained architect whose work was in high demand in the 1960s thanks to his artful use of post-and-beam construction, designed this house while still a student, as a home for his parents. Later, he used it as his own residence. The house was restored this year by the design firm HabHouse, in consultation with Mr. Corey.\", \"The city of Sierra Madre sits at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains, about 15 minutes from Pasadena and Altadena.

To the left is a living room with floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides, a brick fireplace and exposed beams that stretch across the ceiling and outdoors, over a patio, making the space feel larger than it is. On one side of the living room is a dining area and a door to a kitchen with custom birch cabinets and floor tiles from Japan.\", \"A window-lined hallway off the foyer connects two bedrooms and a bathroom. The bedroom nearest the foyer is behind wood sliding doors, and is large enough to hold a full-size bed. Next door is the primary suite, which has a wall of built-in closets, a row of clerestory windows and a glass door that opens to the side yard; the en suite bathroom has new Japanese floor tile and an original pink pedestal sink repaired during the renovation.\", \"A third bedroom, off the kitchen, has exterior access. Also on this side of the house is another full bathroom, with an original blue bathtub and matching toilet, as well as a laundry closet.\", \"Outdoor space: The renovation extended to the outdoor spaces as well: A trellis detail lost over the course of the home\\u2019s life was restored to the deck, providing shade from the sun. The deck is large enough to hold a dining table and chairs, and has views of the San Gabriel Mountains. The landscaping surrounding the deck and the side yard was done with an emphasis on drought-tolerant plants. A rear alley provides access to the garage, which holds two cars, with additional space for storage.\", \"Taxes: $22,356 (estimated)\", \"Contact: Nate Cole, Suprstructur, and Joey Kiralla and Michelle St. Clair, Sotheby\\u2019s International Realty, 562-673-3550; suprstructur.com\", \"A beach city about 45 minutes south of Silicon Valley, Santa Cruz draws Bay Area residents looking for a slower pace of life and access to some of California\\u2019s best surfing.
