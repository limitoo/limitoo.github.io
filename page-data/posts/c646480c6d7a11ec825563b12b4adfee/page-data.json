Leisure and hospitality companies, such as restaurants, bars and hotels, saw the greatest number of employee exits, with more than 1 million workers quitting in November alone, the U.S. Department of Labor said on Tuesday. That represents an increase of 60% for the industry, a major employment sector, compared with a year earlier.\", \"The data suggests that \\\"Great Resignation,\\\" as some experts have labeled the trend, continues apace amid an extremely tight labor market. With workers in high demand, bosses are raising wages and dangling incentives such as hiring bonuses. That is providing opportunities for many employees to quit lower-paying jobs in favor of more lucrative work.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"People who quit are taking other jobs, not leaving the workforce,\\\" tweeted Heidi Shierholz, the former chief economist at the Labor Department and now president of Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Workers being able to quit their jobs to take better jobs is a very good thing and signals an economy with healthy dynamism,\\\" she added.\", \"In the latest #JOLTS data, 4.5 million people quit, but *6.7 million* people were hired. People who quit are taking other jobs, not leaving the workforce. On net, the labor market is gaining a ton of jobs every month. 2/\", \"Some Americans also may be stepping back from their jobs to start their own businesses or due to COVID-related issues, such as the challenge of juggling work and childcare as infections around the U.S. top 1 million cases per day.\", \"The worker shortage isn't likely to relent anytime soon due to demographic issues on top of the pandemic, according to Emsi Burning Glass.\", \"\\\"With the surge in Baby Boomer retirement, declines in labor force participation amongst millennials, ebbing birth rates and falling immigration numbers, don't expect the labor shortage to be completely solved in the New Year,\\\" said Ron Hetrick, senior economist at Emsi Burning Glass, in an email before the data was released.\", \"Between January 2020 and October 2021, 3.3 million Americans opted to retire, according to new data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank \\u2014 many more than normal demographic trends had predicted.\", \"At the same time, employers posted fewer job openings, which declined to 10.6 million in November from about 11 million in the prior month, the Labor Department numbers show. Several industries saw a decline in job openings, including accommodation and food services, where new job postings fell by about 260,000, the BLS said.\\u00a0\", \"To be sure, the data marks labor-market trends in November, before the rise of the Omicron variant. The sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in December and January may create new headwinds for the labor market.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The surge in infections is already weighing on demand in high-contact service sectors, but the bigger impact of the Omicron wave will be on labor supply, as workers testing positive are forced to isolate,\\\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.\\u00a0\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"c646480c6d7a11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c646480c6d7a11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
