The committee says it needs the documents to further understand the events leading up to, during, and following the January 6 assault on the Capitol.\\u00a0\", \"Judge Tanya Chutkan is now tasked with deciding whether the claim of privilege made by the former president outweighs the incumbent president's waiver of that same principle.\", \"In court on Thursday, Mr. Trump's attorney Justin Clark argued the documents requested are not only subject to executive privilege, but that the requests are also extremely broad and do not lend themselves to a valid legislative purpose for the House.\\u00a0\", \"The request from the House and the National Archives' decision to release the documents amounts to a \\\"broad document dump,\\\" Clark alleged, which has \\\"turn[ed] into a partisan exercise.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"The judge seemed unconvinced by much of his argument, but granted that some of the included records, like campaign polling data, are \\\"alarmingly broad.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Nevertheless, as Clark argued that the committee has other means of investigating the January 6 attack outside of obtaining the archived records like subpoenas and depositions, Chutkan again rejected his claims.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Your client has instructed others who have received subpoenas not to comply,\\\" she told Mr. Trump's attorney, so the records may, in fact, be necessary.\\u00a0\", \"The judge later pressed general counsel for the House of Representatives, Douglas Letter, on the breadth of the House's request for documents, particularly those that seem to predate the 2020 election. \", \"\\\"We want to see who did President Trump talk to, who was he consulting with ... what really led up to this,\\\" Letter responded, explaining an additional job of the committee is working to rebuild public confidence in the electoral system.\\u00a0\", \"Chutkan, however, pressed on, saying, \\\"There has to be a limit ... where is the line drawn?\\\"\\u00a0\", \"And as for the National Archives, Elizabeth Shapiro of the Justice Department also argued that deference should be granted to Mr. Biden's decision to waive privilege over the Trump White House records. \\\"These are not documents where privilege and confidentiality will survive forever. Far from it,\\\" she added.\\u00a0\", \"Since the former president filed his lawsuit, the National Archives has revealed that it identified more than 1,500 pages pertinent to the committee's request. These include daily presidential diaries, the files of then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, multiple binders belonging to then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, and White House talking points alleging voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\\u00a0\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"1f84b7f03d9c11eca10f000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1f84b7f03d9c11eca10f000017025a03"}},
