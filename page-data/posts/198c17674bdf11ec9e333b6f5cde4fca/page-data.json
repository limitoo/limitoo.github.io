Health Service (CAMHS) in July last year.\", \"Meron Savage described her daughter as \\\"an amazing, talented girl with her whole life ahead of her\\\".\", \"They had just chosen paint to redecorate her bedroom, as well as new furniture and accessories to match the theme, when Kate died.\", \"During the last six months of her life, Kate attended the emergency department at Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) on 11 occasions and had seven admissions.\", \"A report by WA's Chief Psychiatrist Nathan Gibson, released last year, found there had been missed opportunities to change the course of Kate's life, including by much earlier intervention, after she was first referred to CAMHS in 2015.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">My last chance to learn\\u00a0truth: mother</div>\", \"Ms Savage this
