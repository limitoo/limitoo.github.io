Japan\\u2019s economy is the world\\u2019s third largest after those of the United States and China.\", \"The stimulus package is Japan\\u2019s largest to date and accounts for around 10 percent of its gross domestic product, officials said. Mr. Kishida said on Friday that it could increase G.D.P. by around 5.6 percent.\", \"\\u201cI want to bring Japan\\u2019s economy, which has been severely damaged, onto a trajectory of recovery,\\u201d he told reporters on Friday afternoon.\", \"The package includes aid to struggling businesses and hospitals, money for strengthening semiconductor supply chains, and programs to encourage domestic tourism and investment in a nationwide university endowment fund.\", \"It also includes a one-time cash handout of 100,000 yen, or $878, per child under 18 for households where the highest-earning parent makes less than about $84,300 a year. Around nine in 10 households with children are eligible.\", \"The cash handouts to young families are not especially popular. Critics have questioned the need for them in a country with an aging society.\", \"Last spring, the government sent 100,000 yen stimulus checks to every resident, but they did little to raise inflation or consumer spending. Analysts estimate that around 70 percent of the handouts went to household savings.\", \"Japan announced a partial easing of border restrictions earlier this month and has already lifted virtually all restrictions on its economy amid a falling virus caseload. Its rate of fully vaccinated people \\u2014 76 percent of the population, according to a New York Times tracker \\u2014 is also one of the highest among rich nations.\", \"But a ban on international tourists continues to weigh on economic growth.\"]","href_hash":"9dc7a167492e11ecbd3dd1f62673603e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9dc7a167492e11ecbd3dd1f62673603e"}},
