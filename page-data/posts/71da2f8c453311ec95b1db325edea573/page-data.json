But now, seeing her husband\\u2019s cousins and her mother quietly weeping, Masooma knew she had lost him, too.\", \"\\u201cHow is this possible?\\u201d asked Masooma, 32, burying her face in her damp head scarf.\", \"For decades, violence has torn through Afghanistan\\u2019s Shiite community, perpetuated first by the Taliban \\u2014 who consider Shiites heretics \\u2014 and in more recent years by the Islamic State Khorasan, or ISIS-K.\", \"When the Taliban, hard-line Sunni Muslims, seized power in August, they vowed to end decades of bloodshed and sought to reassure Afghan Shiites that they would not again be their targets, as they were during the group\\u2019s previous rule from 1996 to 2001. This time around, the Taliban have allowed Shiites to observe the holy holiday of Ashura; they dispatched a Shiite cleric to do outreach in Shiite communities; they visited Shiite mosques to demonstrate solidarity and they vowed that the new government would keep them safe.\", \"But two suicide bombings by ISIS-K at mosques in October, which together killed more than 90 people and injured hundreds of others, stoked fears that in fact the Taliban would allow the Islamic State\\u2019s campaign against Afghan Shiites to go unchecked. The attacks also fueled concerns in neighboring Iran, a Shiite Muslim theocracy and self-proclaimed defender of Shiite Muslims around the world, where officials have voiced concerns about the fate of Afghan Shiites under Taliban rule and the threat of a resurgent ISIS-K launching attacks on Iranian soil.\", \"Now many Afghan Shiites fear the beginning of a new brutal chapter, one in which their security depends on the very movement that once targeted them.\", \"Few understand that devastating new reality more than Masooma and her family. In the span of just two weeks, she and her relatives lost a grandfather, father and son \\u2014 three generations of Afghan men who spent most of their lives in a country at war but died after the bloodshed was meant to be over.\", \"\\u201cWhen the Taliban became in power, we were not expecting these things,\\u201d said Masooma\\u2019s uncle-in-law, Abdul Raziq Rajabi, 50, the morning after Maisam died. \\u201cBut I can\\u2019t say now whether the Taliban will support our people or not.\\u201d\", \"After the attack, an uneasy quiet enveloped their neighborhood of mud brick houses stitched together with narrow alleyways and electric wires dangling overhead. It is one of a handful of Shiite districts in Kandahar, the Pashtun heartland of the country. Some Shiites there are Hazara \\u2014 an ethnic minority that has been persecuted for centuries \\u2014 who migrated to the southern city for work or to flee violence. Others have lived in the south for hundreds of years.\", \"Masooma\\u2019s father-in-law, Haji Nematullah Rajabi, 60, migrated from the central province of Ghazni to Kandahar nearly half a century ago and lived a comfortable life in the relative calm of the city. He started selling agricultural equipment, married his wife, Sughra, and eventually had a daughter and two sons.\", \"Ezzatullah Rajabi, 33, Sughra and Nematullah\\u2019s son, married Masooma and they had three boys of their own. They moved to Kunduz, an economic hub of northern Afghanistan. The move made sense to expand the family business but terrified Ezzatullah\\u2019s mother. After the Taliban briefly seized the city in 2015 and 2016, Sughra called every week begging him to return to Kandahar.\", \"Still, when the Taliban began their military offensive last summer, even Ezzatullah was on edge. After the group seized power and offered public pledges to protect Afghan Shiites, who make up 10 to 20 percent of the country\\u2019s population, Ezzatullah said his fears dissipated.\", \"Then on Oct. 8 an Islamic State suicide attack devastated Ezzatullah\\u2019s mosque in Kunduz, killing at least 43 people.\", \"Masooma heard the explosion and sprinted to the mosque, knowing her husband had gone there to pray. She scoured the bodies being carried out in bloody scarves, looking for him. The next morning, Nematullah arrived from Kandahar and found Ezzatullah\\u2019s body \\u2014 his limbs bent like a rag doll \\u2014 in a hospital morgue. Seeing him, Nematullah nearly collapsed. \", \"The family returned to Kandahar to bury Ezzatullah and the following Friday \\u2014 determined to show his unwavering faith \\u2014 Nematullah went to his mosque to pray. He called Masooma three times that morning asking her to send his oldest grandson, Maisam, to join him.\", \"Masooma relented. But around 1 p.m., she heard another blast \\u2014 this time from two suicide bombers who barged into the mosque during Friday prayers. The explosion left bodies scattered across bloodstained carpets. Dazed survivors poured out of the building through broken windows, while others looked for loved ones.\", \"Nematullah\\u2019s surviving son, Ahmad Zia, found him among the bodies \\u2014 his right side bloodied, eyes closed and barely able to speak \\u2014 and then spotted Maisam, whose head was wrapped in a bloodied scarf. He brought them both to the hospital, where Maisam was put on life support and Nematullah died \\u2014 one of at least 47 people killed that day.\", \"The attack on Bibi Fatima Mosque was ISIS-K\\u2019s first in Kandahar, the Taliban\\u2019s historic stronghold, and it shocked the Shiite community there. For many, the week that followed was a blur of funerals and mourning. In one Shiite neighborhood, mourners poured into a cemetery for bombing victims each day, whispering prayers at the row of fresh graves.\", \"By the cemetery gate, talk of security consumed a group of men as they passed around a pot of tea. The new, untested government could not confront the resurgent threat from ISIS-K, some said. Others questioned the Taliban\\u2019s professed intentions to protect Afghan Shiites \\u2014 even wondering whether some Talibs might see the recent attacks as an invitation to freely kill Shiites.\", \"\\u201cThe Taliban are just saying they are trying to keep our security, but why should we believe them?\\u201d asked Khalil, 36, staring at the graves.\", \"For Shiite community leaders, the implication of the bombing was clear: It was time to take security back into their own hands. Days after the attack, they met with Taliban officials at the mosque \\u2014 the air still heavy with the smell of charred flesh \\u2014 and demanded that the new government return seized weapons to the roughly 40 Shiite places of worship in Kandahar.\", \"The Taliban agreed to return up to three weapons to every Shiite mosque and offered compensation to families of the bombing victims.\", \"\\u201cIt is the right not only of the Shia\\u2019s nation, but the right of all Kandahar\\u2019s people to be secure,\\u201d Haji Mullah Abdul Ghafar Mohammadi 41, the Taliban police chief in Kandahar, said in an interview.\", \"But weeks later, the Taliban had still not yet returned the weapons \\u2014 prompting some Shiite leaders to take matters into their own hands. \", \"As men poured into Bibi Fatima Mosque the following Friday, two men with Kalashnikov rifles manned the entrance, while plainclothes security guards kept watch from behind nearby shop counters. Others were perched on nearly every roof in the vicinity, their bodies hunched over and weapons aimed at the pavement below.\", \". \", \"Still, many remained on edge. At the Rajabi family home, Ezzatullah\\u2019s brother, Ahmad Zia, planned to go to the mosque, but his mother would not allow it.\", \"\\u201cHe is the only son I have left,\\u201d his mother, Sughra, said quietly.\", \"He offered her a pained look, Maisam\\u2019s condition heavy on his mind. For the past week, the boy had been hospitalized, intubated and unconscious. Eleven relatives had taken shifts squeezing an old manual oxygen pump to keep him alive. \", \"When Ahmad Zia went back to the hospital that night, the doctors gave him the news he feared: Maisam was brain-dead.\", \"The next morning, the family gathered for the now well-rehearsed ritual of death. Relatives visited the family home, prayed at the mosque and took Maisam\\u2019s body to the cemetery to bury him, right beside his father and grandfather.\"]","href_hash":"71da2f8c453311ec95b1db325edea573"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"71da2f8c453311ec95b1db325edea573"}},
