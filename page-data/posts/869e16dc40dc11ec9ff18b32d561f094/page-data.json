Mr. Lakey died two days later.\", \"The case brought further scrutiny to the use of Tasers by law enforcement officers. Supporters say the devices are a practical alternative to often-lethal firearms, but critics point out they have contributed to many fatalities.\", \"In addition to second-degree murder, which is punishable by 10 years to life in prison, Mr. Dingman, 35, and Mr. Taylor, 27, were found guilty of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon by a jury in Carter County, Okla., according to court records. They are to be sentenced on Dec. 2.\", \"Shannon McMurray, a lawyer for Mr. Dingman, said on Monday that the former officer planned to appeal his conviction.\", \"Citing a medical examiner\\u2019s autopsy report, she said that Mr. Lakey had an enlarged heart and critical coronary artery disease before he died. The report listed the officers\\u2019 use of electrical weapons and restraint as contributing to Mr. Lakey\\u2019s death.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s just a tragedy for everybody,\\u201d Ms. McMurray said. \\u201cIn my opinion, they acted within policy.\\u201d\", \"Ms. McMurray said that the officers had been trying to avoid using other types of force on Mr. Lakey. \\u201cThey were truly, truly concerned for his safety and theirs if they had gone hands-on,\\u201d she said.\", \"Warren Gotcher, a lawyer for Mr. Taylor, said on Monday that his client would also file an appeal.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re very disappointed in the verdict,\\u201d said Mr. Gotcher, who also pointed to Mr. Lakey\\u2019s health as playing a significant role in his death. \\u201cNo one could look at him and tell that he had that much of a diseased heart.\\u201d\", \"The police department in Wilson, which is about 100 miles south of Oklahoma City, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\", \"A lawsuit filed by Mr. Lakey\\u2019s family said that his body was riddled with Taser probes and that medical providers had told the family that he died from multiple heart attacks.\", \"Spencer Bryan, a lawyer for Mr. Lakey\\u2019s parents, Doug and Cynthia Lakey, said in a statement on Monday that they were \\u201cgrateful to the jury and prosecution for taking these officers off the streets,\\u201d but admonished the police chief over his explanation during the trial about why the officers had kept using their Tasers.\", \"The chief, Kevin Coley, testified that the officers had been attempting to cause neuromuscular incapacitation in Mr. Lakey but that he had kept moving around on the ground, the television station KXII reported. The chief could not be reached on Monday.\", \"During the officers\\u2019 encounter with Mr. Lakey, they were responding to a call that involved his \\u201cacting in a disorderly way,\\u201d according to the State Bureau of Investigation.\", \"When Mr. Lakey would not comply with the officers\\u2019 commands, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Dingman used their Tasers a combined total of more than 50 times, \\u201cwhich greatly exceeded what would have been necessary or warranted by the attendant circumstances,\\u201d court records said.\", \"The records said that \\u201csuch dangerous and unnecessary\\u201d use of the Tasers was a \\u201csubstantial factor\\u201d in bringing about Mr. Lakey\\u2019s death.\", \"Craig Ladd, the district attorney for the 20th Judicial District in Oklahoma, which includes Carter County, said on Monday that police officers were trained to limit Taser exposure to 15 seconds or less and to avoid simultaneously using their devices. But in the case of Mr. Lakey, he said, the electrical connection from the officers\\u2019 Tasers lasted 3 minutes and 14 seconds.\", \"\\u201cThey clearly failed to adhere to these safety guidelines,\\u201d Mr. Ladd said, adding that in Oklahoma, officers are only permitted to use the degree of force \\u201creasonably necessary\\u201d under the circumstances.\", \"\\u201cThey Tased Jared because he was lying naked in a ditch and wouldn\\u2019t put his hands behind his back when they asked him to, even though it wasn\\u2019t clear whether Jared truly understood what was going on or what he was being requested to do,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHe never made any aggressive moves towards the officers, swung at them, lunged at them, or kicked at them.\\u201d\", \"Tasers, which are part of a class of \\u201cless lethal\\u201d tools, are designed to help law enforcement officers temporarily immobilize a person by jolting them with electricity.\", \"Axon Enterprise, which makes them, says the devices save lives and prevent injuries. But more than 1,000 people in the United States have died after being shocked with stun guns by police, according to a 2017 investigation by Reuters.\"]","href_hash":"869e16dc40dc11ec9ff18b32d561f094"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"869e16dc40dc11ec9ff18b32d561f094"}},
