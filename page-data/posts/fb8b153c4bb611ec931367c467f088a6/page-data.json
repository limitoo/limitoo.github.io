The result premiered at Los Angeles Opera in February 2020, and arrives at the Metropolitan Opera on Tuesday, directed by Mary Zimmerman and conducted by Yannick N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin.\", \"Aucoin and Ruhl wrote to each other for several years about turning the poetry of her play into a libretto, building character through music, and understanding the strengths and limitations of opera. They recently looked back at those messages and discussed them in a joint interview. These are edited excerpts from their correspondence and their present-day reflections.\", \"Dear Sarah,\", \"Hi \\u2014 my name\\u2019s Matt Aucoin. Your plays \\u201cEurydice\\u201d and \\u201cThe Clean House\\u201d recently reduced me to a blubbering awe-struck wreck. And then I happened to read an interview with you in which you said, \\u201cEveryone has a great, horrible opera inside him.\\u201d I thought, \\u201cI really want to make a great, horrible opera with this person.\\u201d\", \"Pardon my forwardness \\u2014 and my ignorance, for not knowing your work until now! \\u2014 but I\\u2019m overwhelmed by your lucid musicality. I sensed instantly that you\\u2019re a poet \\u2014 not in any highfalutin\\u2019 sense, but in a more practical one: It\\u2019s clear that you wrote (and write) poetry, and that poetry is a native tongue for you.\", \"Oh, about \\u201clonging looks back\\u201d: I have the same gene as every composer EVER, and I need to write an Orpheus opera.\", \"Might you be interested in creating one together?\", \"Dear Matt,\", \"Thank you so much for the kind words about my plays. I also read an article about you and was struck by a phrase someone wrote about you \\u2014 language becoming music, and music becoming language. I\\u2019m interested in that nexus, too. It\\u2019s true I used to write and still dabble in poetry, and it\\u2019s true I\\u2019d love to collaborate on an opera sometime. I listened to a very small clip of your music on your website and found it quite beautiful; I\\u2019d love to listen to more.\", \"I feel it might be awkward for me to retread the Orpheus territory from his point of view having already written \\u201cEurydice.\\u201d My gut is that I\\u2019m more interested in adapting \\u201cEurydice\\u201d into a musical piece. But it\\u2019s silly for me to make any pronouncements in an email without first talking. So let\\u2019s meet and talk.\", \"MATTHEW AUCOIN I had a separate Orpheus opera in mind that was entirely different, that was in a way an expansion of my piece \\u201cThe Orphic Moment\\u201d \\u2014 much darker, much more twisted. It took a meeting or two for me to be like, you know what, adapting \\u201cEurydice\\u201d makes more sense. I tried to inject a bunch of my ideas into \\u201cEurydice\\u201d; then I felt that the skeleton of the play was so strong that it resisted the foreign energy. So I very quickly decided that we could create a more unified world if we stuck to the play.\", \"SARAH RUHL I don\\u2019t remember it taking you very long to say, \\u201cYes, let\\u2019s do that.\\u201d Always you were trying to make Orpheus more complex, since that was your way in. But Eurydice was so present for me as a character, and it wouldn\\u2019t make sense to retread the material from his perspective.\", \"AUCOIN I think the core of this piece, for me, is: What would you say to someone you lost if you could meet them again in this other space?\", \"RUHL It\\u2019s myth as container, as vehicle \\u2014 rather than myth for myth\\u2019s sake.\", \"Some thoughts \\u2026\", \"Opera as magical realism: I think we should indulge our every magical-realist impulse in this piece. I tend to think opera works better when its creators embrace this quality, since it\\u2019s probably inescapable: If opera is real, its realism is magical. (It just doesn\\u2019t work when people try to house train it or to convince the audience that opera is no weirder or scarier or more surreal than, like, a sitcom.)\\u2014 Matt\", \"AUCOIN In opera, all speech is dream speech. That\\u2019s a law of nature on Planet Opera. Simply because everything is sung, what\\u2019s communicated will tend to have a dreamlike or surreal quality, no matter how much you might want it to sound like \\u201cSeinfeld.\\u201d\", \"RUHL I love what you say about dream speech. I\\u2019ve been wanting to write a piece about the idea that art is a dream we have together. When we\\u2019re sleeping, we dream alone at night. Art becomes an incredible vehicle in which we can have the same dream at the same time, while awake.\", \"It occurs to me that Orpheus has no parents; his lineage is disputed and totally confusing. I\\u2019m sensing that one difference between O + E is that even though Eurydice\\u2019s father is dead, she was deeply close to him, whereas Orpheus was always an orphan.\", \"We might see him first happily singing to himself, and then expressing his pre-wedding anxieties: He\\u2019s torn between his love for Eurydice and his overwhelming need to make music; he\\u2019s not sure where he came from; he\\u2019s never felt 100 percent human; and he\\u2019s unsure if he can give and accept the love he feels so powerfully for Eurydice.\\u2014 Matt\", \"AUCOIN I think there are two implied love triangles in the \\u201cEurydice\\u201d dramaturgy. Eurydice is torn between her connection to her father and her relationship to Orpheus. And Orpheus is also kind of torn between Eurydice and music itself. I think that\\u2019s where the idea of the double [adding a countertenor\\u2019s halo of sound to the baritone role] came from.\", \"I\\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking about Hades. The main thing, from my perspective, is that he\\u2019s a sociopath. He has a total lack of interiority and yet he is alone. Sounds like hell to me. So he feeds off Orpheus and Eurydice, both of whom have (if anything) too much interior life; they\\u2019re too likely to withdraw into their own worlds, and he knows that. He\\u2019s a parasite who sinks his teeth into Eurydice\\u2019s intellect and Orpheus\\u2019s music.\", \"I think it\\u2019s important that Hades\\u2019s lines are simple and direct \\u2014 and emotionally wrong, awkward and unnatural, but in a way that\\u2019s unsettling rather than comical. I think the repetitions of \\u201cinteresting\\u201d risk being a little too funny, especially when they\\u2019re sung.\\u2014 Matt\", \"Do we care that we somewhat lose his absurdity (\\u201cIt was delivered to my elegant high-rise apartment by mistake\\u201d)? The question about humor is maybe a larger question tonally about the piece. I use humor in the play to deflect and deepen the tragedy \\u2014 it could be that doesn\\u2019t play the same in an operatic piece. I don\\u2019t want to totally excise the humor, but in the nasty man it just might not be singable.\\u2014 Sarah\", \"I definitely want to keep the humor!!! I just think Hades needs to be dangerous \\u2014 dangerously deadpan, at first. Which could be funny in its own right. For me the absurdity emerges when we see his gigantic empty loft. But at first, I\\u2019d love him to be eerily nondescript.\\u2014 Matt\", \"RUHL I\\u2019m so happy that Matt has been able to rhythmicize lines and retain their humor.\", \"AUCOIN The challenge with Hades is that it lies at an extreme of the male voice, but he should also sound quite deadpan. The music is absurdly high, but I wanted to create the sense that for him it\\u2019s completely normal.\", \"RUHL I love this idea that Hades is impersonating a person. And I think it\\u2019s wonderful how you figured that out in the singing of it.\", \"AUCOIN It\\u2019s a matter of rhythm and range. Hades\\u2019s music is the exact opposite of proper, correct text setting. When he says \\u201cHow interesting,\\u201d he sings the word \\u201chow\\u201d on a high D flat for an entire bar. And in certain sections, every syllable is accented in this horrible way. It\\u2019s not human.\", \"I think what we are going for is condensing stage time, while distending mythic time \\u2026 if that makes ANY sense!\\u2014 Sarah\", \"RUHL It takes longer to sing than to speak, so everything has to be shorter. But you want the mythic scope of it to still feel big. It\\u2019s a bit of a puzzle. How much can you feel like time is moving slowly in the underworld without actually subjecting the audience to a kind of slowness that they don\\u2019t want to be subjected to?\", \"FATHEREurydice is gone.This is a second death for me.\", \"I wonder about cutting \\u201cThis is a second death for me.\\u201d It\\u2019s a little self-pitying. Might be more moving just: \\u201cEurydice is gone. How do you remember to forget?\\u201d\\u2014 Sarah\", \"AUCOIN This is part of a longer scene where Eurydice\\u2019s father remembers the directions to his childhood home. In an early version of the score, he sang those directions very slowly, and it felt totally wrong \\u2014 like moving through molasses. Sarah, Mary and I all independently came to the conclusion that he had to speak these lines, not sing them. The words carry so much emotion that, unusually for opera, song proved superfluous.\", \"RUHL I had the experience in writing the play as well. I had written a soliloquy that I would describe as an operatic soliloquy; it was poeticized and emotional. And it felt all wrong for who he was as a person.\", \"AUCOIN I think the shape of the drama is so devastating.\", \"RUHL The ending is very sad. I hope it gives people catharsis after this two years of not being able to grieve with others. I\\u2019ve watched two funerals on Zoom. It\\u2019s hard for me to have a good cry on Zoom; I\\u2019m not with other people, and I feel self-conscious with people watching me cry on video. It\\u2019s not that I\\u2019m inviting people to come and cry at \\u201cEurydice\\u201d \\u2014 but in a way, I am.\"]","href_hash":"fb8b153c4bb611ec931367c467f088a6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fb8b153c4bb611ec931367c467f088a6"}},
