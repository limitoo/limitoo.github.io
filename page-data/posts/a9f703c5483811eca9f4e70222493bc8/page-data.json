lunar eclipse?</div>\", \"Here's a rough guide to when and what\\u00a0you'll see across five time zones tomorrow night (all times are local).\", \"As the moon rises over Sydney and Canberra just after 7:30pm-7:45pm,\\u00a0it will be more than three quarters in shadow.\", \"The eclipse will reach its maximum\\u00a0towards the end of twilight at 8:03pm.\", \"All of the Moon will be in shadow except for a\\u00a0tiny sliver of light\\u00a0in the top right-hand corner.\", \"\\\"[Sydney] will have great viewing from eight o'clock, they'll really get\\u00a0to see the maximum,\\\" Dr Hill says.\", \"The partial eclipse\\u00a0in all states and territories in this time zone ends at 9.47pm.\", \"Further south in Melbourne,\\u00a0the eclipse will have already reached maximum before the Moon rises at 8:12pm\\u00a0and the Sun is yet to set.\", \"\\\"It may well be a struggle for the first\\u00a0 20 minutes to half an hour\\u00a0to really be able to sort of see what's going on,\\\" Dr Hill says.\", \"\\\"But we'll still have an hour\\u00a0before the Moon fully reappears again.\\\"\", \"The partial eclipse ends at 9.47pm.\", \"Like Melbourne, the Moon will have already reached maximum as it rises above the horizon over Hobart at 8:17pm.\", \"By the time that twilight ends a little later further south at\\u00a08:51pm,\\u00a0you should be able to make out around half the Moon in shadow.\", \"The partial eclipse ends at 9.47pm.\", \"Queenslanders should get a good view of the maximum eclipse.\", \"Two thirds of the moon will be in shadow when it rises\\u00a0over Brisbane\\u00a0at 6:14pm,\\u00a0just before sunset.\", \"At 7:02pm, twilight will have ended\\u00a0and the Moon\\u00a0will almost be entirely in shadow, except for a sliver of light on its righthand side.\", \"The partial eclipse ends at\\u00a08:47pm.\", \"If you live in Adelaide,\\u00a0you will miss the point when the eclipse is at its maximum\\u00a0(7:32pm), but the Moon will still be three quarters in\\u00a0shadow when it rises above the horizon at 8:11pm.\", \"\\\"Closer to the end of civil twilight (8:31pm),\\u00a0you'll see this band of Moon glowing in the twilight, so it will look really cool,\\\" Dr Musgrave says.\", \"More of the Moon will be slowly revealed until the partial eclipse ends at\\u00a010.33pm.\", \"People living in\\u00a0Darwin\\u00a0will get a similar view to people living in Adelaide.\", \"The Moon rises at\\u00a06:53pm,\\u00a0so you'll miss the maximum eclipse, but\\u00a0twilight ends around 7:16pm,\\u00a0so you'll see the shadow fall away from the Moon.\", \"The partial eclipse ends at\\u00a09:33pm.\", \"Sadly you won't be able to see the partial eclipse at all from Perth and south-western WA, as\\u00a0it is over before the Moon rises at 7pm.\", \"What you might notice if you have keen eyesight is the Moon doesn't look as bright as usual when it rises: it's\\u00a0moving through Earth's outer shadow, known as the penumbra.\", \"But if you live further north in Broome,\\u00a0the Moon rises nearly an hour earlier.\", \"So you may be able to catch the last 15 minutes of the partial eclipse after twilight ends at 6:30pm.\", \"The eclipse ends at 6:47pm in this time zone.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">And that's not all you'll see...</div>\", \"As the Moon rises, it will be in the constellation of Taurus the bull.\", \"So when the Moon is darker, you should be able to make out the stars around it including the beautiful Pleiades, a cluster of stars also known as the Seven Sisters.\", \"\\\"You'll have Pleiades just below the Moon,\\\" Dr Hill says.\", \"Further to the right, you'll see the v-shape of the stars that make up the bull's face, and further right again you'll see the constellation of Orion, aka \\\"the saucepan\\\".\", \"If you can take your eyes off the eclipse above the eastern horizon,\\u00a0turn around and you'll\\u00a0see the three bright planets \\u2014\\u00a0Venus, Jupiter and Saturn
