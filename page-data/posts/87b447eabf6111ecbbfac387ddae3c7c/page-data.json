The former officer served less than half that sentence before he was released from prison in February.\\u00a0His release prompted calls from civil rights leaders, community activists and others \\u00a0who were angry about what they saw as a lenient sentence for the slaying of the teenager \\u2014 whom he shot 16 times \\u2014 for federal prosecutors to charge Van Dyke again.\"]","href_hash":"87b447eabf6111ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"87b447eabf6111ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
