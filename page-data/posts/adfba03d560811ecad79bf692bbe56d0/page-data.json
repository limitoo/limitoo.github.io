He was 72.\", \"The cause was cancer, said the Royal Shakespeare Company, with which Mr. Sher had been closely associated for more than four decades. Gregory Doran, the company\\u2019s artistic director and Mr. Sher\\u2019s husband, had announced in September that he would take compassionate leave to care for Mr. Sher.\", \"Mr. Sher was 32 when he first attracted notice as an actor, playing the leading role of a libidinous, manipulative lecturer in a 1981 BBC adaptation of Malcolm Bradbury\\u2019s novel \\u201cThe History Man.\\u201d He joined the Royal Shakespeare Company the next year.\", \"His breakthrough came in 1984, in the title role of Shakespeare\\u2019s \\u201cRichard III.\\u201d He performed on crutches, which he used as an extension of Richard\\u2019s contorted physique and psyche to evoke Shakespeare\\u2019s description of the character as \\u201ca bottled spider.\\u201d\", \"In The Times of London, Sheridan Morely described his portrayal as \\u201cthe only one in our lifetime to have challenged the 40-year memory of Olivier in that role.\\u201d Other critics agreed that it was a career-making performance. \\u201cIn this unabashed attempt at incarnating evil, Mr. Sher is monstrously convincing,\\u201d Mel Gussow wrote in The New York Times. \", \"In 1985 he won an Olivier Award both for his performance as Richard and for his subsequent role as a drag queen in Harvey Fierstein\\u2019s \\u201cTorch Song Trilogy.\\u201d In his acceptance speech, he said he was happy \\u201cto be the first actor to win an award for playing both a king and a queen.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Sher went on to play numerous great Shakespearean roles, including Shylock in \\u201cThe Merchant of Venice\\u201d (1987), Leontes in \\u201cThe Winter\\u2019s Tale\\u201d (1998), Iago in \\u201cOthello\\u201d (2004), Prospero in \\u201cThe Tempest\\u201d (2008), Falstaff in \\u201cHenry IV,\\u201d Parts One and Two (2014), and the title roles in \\u201cTitus Andronicus\\u201d (1994), \\u201cMacbeth\\u201d (1999) and \\u201cKing Lear\\u201d (2016).\", \"\\u201cThe voice alone is rich, roaring music,\\u201d Charles Isherwood wrote in a 2014 New York Times review of \\u201cHenry IV,\\u201d adding that \\u201cMr. Sher manages to make Shakespeare\\u2019s often arcane language sound as familiar as the slang you\\u2019d hear on the streets today.\\u201d\", \"In 1987, when playing Shylock, Mr. Sher noticed \\u201ca handsome chap playing Solanio,\\u201d he later recalled, \\u201cso I asked the director who he was.\\u201d It was Mr. Doran, who would become his partner and, in 2015, his husband.\", \"After a tense first collaboration, when Mr. Doran directed Mr. Sher in the title role of \\u201cTitus Andronicus,\\u201d a production they took to Mr. Sher\\u2019s native South Africa in 1995, they determined that they wouldn\\u2019t discuss work at home. (They went on to work together extensively, but not exclusively.)\", \"In addition to Mr. Doran, Mr. Sher\\u2019s survivors include two brothers, Joel and Randall.\", \"Mr. Sher\\u2019s dramatic range was extensive. He won rave reviews for his performances in \\u201cCyrano de Bergerac\\u201d and Arthur Miller\\u2019s \\u201cDeath of a Salesman,\\u201d both directed by Mr. Doran. He played Arturo Ui in Brecht\\u2019s \\u201cThe Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui\\u201d and Joseph K in an adaptation of Kafka\\u2019s \\u201cThe Trial,\\u201d and he won his second Olivier Award in 1997 for his portrayal of the painter Stanley Spencer in Pam Gem\\u2019s \\u201cStanley.\\u201d He was awarded a knighthood for services to the theater in 2000.\", \"Mr. Sher was also a prolific writer and an accomplished artist. He published an autobiography, \\u201cBeside Myself,\\u201d in 2001, as well as four novels, two plays and three theater diaries, illustrated with his sketches and paintings.\", \"In many of his books he described his connection to, and ambivalence about, South Africa. \\u201cHome. Love. Hate,\\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \\u201cA triangle, a difficult equation, it\\u2019s always there for me.\\u201d\", \"In 2004 he wrote and starred in \\u201cPrimo,\\u201d an adaptation of \\u201cIf This Is a Man,\\u201d Primo Levi\\u2019s unsparing 1947 account of daily life in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Writing about the 2005 Broadway production, Ben Brantley of The Times said that Mr. Sher \\u201ccreates a portrait in which brutal memory penetrates the very marrow of one man\\u2019s existence.\\u201d\", \"He frequently spoke of being drawn to playing outsiders and misfits. \\u201cI was a white Jewish South African and I didn\\u2019t feel like I belonged in the classical British theater,\\u201d he said in an interview with The Times before the premiere of John Kani\\u2019s \\u201cKunene and the King\\u201d in 2019. \\u201cI always felt a bit like an interloper.\\u201d\", \"In what was to be his last role, he played a terminally ill South African actor preparing to play King Lear. In the interview, he said that he had tried to leave his South African identity behind when he moved to Britain, but that he could now celebrate the way his life \\u201chad come full circle.\\u201d\", \"Antony Sher was born in Cape Town on June 14, 1949, the third of four children of Emmanuel Sher, an importer of animal hides;, and Margery (Abramowitz) Sher, who ran the house. \\u201cHer role in life was of commander in chief, and that often mean battle conditions,\\u201d Mr. Sher wrote of their life in Sea Point, the middle-class white suburb where he grew up.\", \"Although his grandparents were Lithuanian Jews who had fled pogroms in Europe, Mr. Sher said he had little sense growing up that they were living amid similarly oppressive conditions for Black people in apartheid South Africa. \\u201cMy family was typical of white families at the time, almost ignorant about apartheid, which sounds impossible but true,\\u201d he said in 2019. \\u201cI became politicized much later in England.\\u201d\", \"Short, slight and bespectacled, Mr. Sher never felt he fit in at the sports-mad boys\\u2019 school he attended. Sent by his mother to elocution classes, he was introduced to the plays of John Osborne, Harold Pinter and Arnold Wesker. By 16, he had decided to go to drama school in London. \", \"First however, he had to do nine months of national army service, obligatory for all white men in South Africa. Although it was a traumatic experience, he wrote in his autobiography that he later came to regard it as \\u201ca kind of research trip\\u201d for playing Macbeth, Richard III, Cyrano and others.\", \"In 1968, Mr. Sher flew to London with his parents and auditioned for both the Central School of Speech and Drama and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. Both turned him down. The Royal Academy\\u2019s letter, he recalled, was particularly wounding. \\u201cWe strongly urge you to seek a different career,\\u201d it said.\", \"He found a place at the Webber Douglas Academy, where his teachers included Steven Berkoff, then performed with the theater group Gay Sweatshop before landing the role of Ringo Starr in Willy Russell\\u2019s Beatles musical \\u201cJohn, Paul, George, Ringo \\u2026 and Bert,\\u201d which transferred to the West End. During the run of the show, Mr. Sher met Jim Hooper, a fellow actor, with whom he would live for the next 18 years.\", \"It took Mr. Sher a long time to admit openly that he was gay; he had two relationships with women after drama school and a brief marriage before publicly acknowledging his homosexuality in 1989. Rather disappointingly, he wrote, that revelation \\u201cmade no impact whatsoever.\\u201d\", \"He also tried hard, early on, to shed any traces of a South African identity, telling people he was British. \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t just that I was ashamed of apartheid,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cI was also ashamed of coming from a cultural wasteland. How could you become a famous actor if you were a white South African?\\u201d\", \"After \\u201cThe History Man,\\u201d Mr. Sher appeared in a handful of films, including \\u201cMrs. Brown\\u201d and \\u201cShakespeare in Love,\\u201d but his career remained firmly anchored in the theater. He overcame a cocaine addiction in the mid-1990s and later remarked that he had been able to use that experience in playing Falstaff.\", \"\\u201cFor an actor,\\u201d he said, nothing is wasted.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"adfba03d560811ecad79bf692bbe56d0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"adfba03d560811ecad79bf692bbe56d0"}},
