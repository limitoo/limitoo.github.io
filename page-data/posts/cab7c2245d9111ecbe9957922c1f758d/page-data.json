It starts to lose performance the closer it gets, and that doesn\\u2019t aid good racing.\\u201d\", \"When Brawn \\u2014 a former technical director at Ferrari and team principal at Mercedes who won the drivers\\u2019 and constructors\\u2019 titles with his own team, Brawn GP, in 2009 \\u2014 joined the Formula 1 Group in 2017, he set up a research group \\u201cto chase raceability.\\u201d\", \"The takeover of Formula 1 by Liberty Media Corporation in 2017 ensured that there was a budget to tackle the issue.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019d been no resource committed to this area,\\u201d Brawn said. \\u201cThe rules had been developed by the teams who had all the knowledge, the expertise and the funding.\", \"\\u201cThe regulations evolve through proposals and suggestions from the teams. They never made it a priority to make the cars friendly to race each other. Suddenly there was resource made available.\\u201d\", \"The research group, working with the F.I.A., the sport\\u2019s governing body, set about trying to understand the reasons for the loss of aerodynamic performance and designing a car that would allow the drivers to race wheel to wheel on a more regular basis.\", \"The group first constructed a computer model of one car following another to assess the problem. Once that was understood, models were built and tested in a wind tunnel.\", \"The car, which was the creation of Formula 1\\u2019s interpretation of the rules, was unveiled at this year\\u2019s British Grand Prix. The 2022 cars will also have Pirelli\\u2019s new 18-inch tires after decades of the sport using 13-inch tires.\", \"The 10 teams will then produce their own cars based on the Formula 1 design. They will take those cars to the track for the first time in preseason testing at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Spain from Feb. 23 to 25. The first race is in Bahrain on March 20.\", \"\\u201cOur process won\\u2019t stop,\\u201d Brawn said. \\u201cOnce we see the new cars race, we\\u2019ll see the solutions the teams have come up with, and we\\u2019ll evaluate them and make sure we\\u2019re not losing the momentum on this initiative to make the cars more raceable.\\u201d\", \"Formula 1 has improved the way air flows around a car. Recent cars have pushed the flow out to the side, which means the air stays low and slows the following car.\", \"Next year\\u2019s cars will channel the air underneath and through the car, leading to a very high flow over its rear.\", \"\\u201cTo give you an idea of some numbers, this year\\u2019s car, when it was two car lengths behind, it lost half of its performance,\\u201d Brawn said.\", \"\\u201cThe new car only loses 10 or 15 percent of its performance. It\\u2019s a massive difference.\\u201d\", \"After winning eight consecutive constructors\\u2019 titles, Mercedes\\u2019 dominance of Formula 1 could end next year if a rival team has found better solutions in interpreting the rules.\", \"When new regulations are introduced, engineers study them in the hope of discovering a silver bullet.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s pretty much possible that teams who didn\\u2019t compete for the world championship this year, whether it\\u2019s Ferrari, McLaren, Aston Martin or Alpine, come up with intelligent concepts based on more runs than anybody else and just doing it very right,\\u201d said Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal.\", \"\\u201cSo I think we can expect closer fighting for the championships and in races than we have had before, and that\\u2019s exciting.\\u201d\", \"Red Bull fought with Mercedes for the constructors\\u2019 and drivers\\u2019 titles into the last race in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.\", \"Although teams stopped the development of this season\\u2019s cars early in the year to focus their resources on the 2022 models, the intensity of the title fight between Mercedes and Red Bull may have had an impact.\", \"\\u201cWhen Ferrari turn up with the fastest car and smash us out of the park at the first race then you\\u2019ll have to say that it probably did,\\u201d said Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve all known that big regulation changes were coming for 2022, and we\\u2019ve applied our resource accordingly. I\\u2019m sure each team has done what they feel is right, but, of course, the battle with Mercedes put pressure on the organization.\\u201d\", \"Horner said there had been \\u201ca monumental effort\\u201d from his team to focus on the championship challenge and the development of next year\\u2019s car.\", \"\\u201cWe will only see, when we come back in a couple of months\\u2019 time with completely new cars that will look different, feel different and drive differently, as to who\\u2019s got it right and who\\u2019s got it wrong,\\u201d he said.\", \"Ferrari finished third in the constructors\\u2019 championship, 290 points behind Mercedes, a significant improvement after it was sixth in 2020.\", \"Laurent Mekies, the Ferrari sporting director, said next season was \\u201can important opportunity.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAs much as we would like it to be a turning point for us, it is the case for anybody that has not fought for a win,\\u201d Mekies said. \\u201cThey will think the same, so we are conscious of that side of the challenge.\", \"\\u201cIn terms of changing the order, this may happen. I am not saying [the standings] will be upside down, but a few times when we have had a big change in the regulations in the past, it has changed cycles.\\u201d\", \"Haas finished last in this year\\u2019s championship and failed to score a point. The team made the decision before the season not to develop its car to concentrate solely on the 2022 car.\", \"G\\u00fcnther Steiner, the team principal, is optimistic the decision will pay off.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m cautiously confident we will be in a better position,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHopefully in the midfield fighting for points next year.\\u201d\", \"After five years with Mercedes, winning 10 Grands Prix, Valtteri Bottas moves to Alfa Romeo next year. The team scored only 13 points this season.\", \"Bottas said \\u201cthe beauty of the new regulations\\u201d meant \\u201canything is possible,\\u201d but he is realistic.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think we\\u2019re going to be consistently fighting for the wins next year, like with Mercedes,\\u201d Bottas said. \\u201cBut consistently being in the points in the first year with the team, that is possible.\", \"\\u201cThere are so many variables and so many things that will eventually affect how it will be.\\u201d\", \"Because of his history of innovation with Formula 1 teams and his technical knowledge, Brawn is eagerly anticipating the arrival of next year\\u2019s cars and seeing how the teams have deciphered the new rules.\", \"\\u201cWhen the teams first saw the regulations, there were moans and groans about the fact we\\u2019d taken so much scope away from them,\\u201d Brawn said. \\u201cBut as they explored them, they realized there was still plenty of potential.\", \"\\u201cI always took the approach, when I was a technical director, that I had to work within the regulations that were there. Given they were the same regulations for everyone, whoever did the best job with them would be the one who would succeed.\\u201d\", \"Brawn is happy with the solution Formula 1 has delivered, although it is only \\u201ca platform for the future.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThere may be a little bit of disparity in performance when we start off because everyone\\u2019s going to come up with different solutions, but once we\\u2019ve settled down, this will be a much better platform for the cars to be designed around.\\u201d\", \"The question is, will the racing improve? \\u201cYes,\\u201d Brawn said. \\u201cWe will have cars much closer in performance.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"cab7c2245d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cab7c2245d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}},
