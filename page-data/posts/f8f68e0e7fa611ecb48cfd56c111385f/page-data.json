A model of a car with my number was then placed among others on a board-game-like grid filmed from above. Participants could choose from a series of prompts (\\u201cpull forward,\\u201d \\u201chonk,\\u201d etc.) and disembodied hands would move the cars, or not, on the grid.\", \"At the same time, a series of messages in another window was going on and on about someone named Angela, who was dead, or not \\u2014 or maybe a ghost. Since I was simultaneously trying to watch the cars and follow the comments in the chat box, I quickly lost track of the Angela side of things. (It\\u2019s best to experience \\u201cTraffic\\u201d with two screens; I spent the 45-minute running time toggling between my laptop and phone.)\", \"The overall effect was like a puckish re-enactment (with a soup\\u00e7on of Battleship visuals) of Jean-Luc Godard\\u2019s \\u201cWeekend,\\u201d in which a monstrous, paralyzing traffic jam devolves into violent chaos. Except that 55 years after its release, Godard\\u2019s movie remains more trenchant, formally and politically, than \\u201cTraffic\\u201d \\u2014 though it ends on a suggestion of existential dread \\u2014 or any of the other six shows I caught at Exponential.\", \"Unlike its higher-profile January siblings, the Under the Radar and Prototype festivals, which canceled their 2022 editions, the smaller, nimbler Exponential \\u2014 which focuses on emerging experimental artists \\u2014 managed to go ahead by pivoting to a free digital format. (It runs until Monday, and most of the programming will remain available on its YouTube channel for the foreseeable future.)\", \"\\u201cTraffic\\u201d was not the only project to borrow from gaming. In \\u201cStill Goes (The Game),\\u201d much of the screen is taken up by the explorations of two dogs, Spot and Lysol, who become humanoids and set off to wander in a digital world. The creators, Nola Latty and Thomas Wagner, play the game in a smaller window and comment on the proceedings. \\u201cStill Goes\\u201d evades deeper issues relating to the differences between species and unfurls like a lo-fi sandbox adventure.\", \"But it did leave me with questions: How is this theater, or even performance? Why do I feel like I could be watching Ryan Trecartin videos instead?\", \"I mention Trecartin because throughout Exponential, I felt as if theater was trying to play catch-up with the art world. The performing arts have been undergoing an identity crisis during the last two years, and my lack of engagement with much of what I was watching this past week might have been because I had mismanaged my expectations.\", \"Even after two years of pandemic-related disruptions have forced us to start rethinking paradigms and reconsidering assumptions, it\\u2019s still hard to shake habits that were formed when a few Greeks started hanging out in amphitheaters. I had been expecting what Exponential participants might consider calcified (to them) ideas of performances, but the festival appears unconcerned with antiquated borders separating installations, video, live performance, theater, music, movement. Or at least this virtual edition accelerated Exponential\\u2019s evolution toward not caring about those borders.\", \"Fine, but if only there had been more wit, style, imagination.\", \"While one of the festival\\u2019s most anticipated selections, Leonie Bell with Local Grandma\\u2019s \\u201cWe Live to Die: The Grieving Widows Club\\u201d does not open until Monday, the pieces I caught mostly fell short of their proclaimed ambitions. Many show descriptions nowadays, especially on the outer limits where Exponential dwells, tend to read like grant applications promising the excavation of Big Subjects. The reality usually turns out to be merely ho-hum \\u2014 call it the \\u201call bark and no bite\\u201d syndrome.\", \"We were informed, for example, that Joe Hendel\\u2019s \\u201cArtificial (Man) Intelligence\\u201d is about \\u201ca menagerie of cyborg males living in the uncanny valley, exposing their cut up, hybrid psychologies to the world in order to gain a sense of control over their cybernetically deterritorialized destinies.\\u201d What we got was a shapeless digital montage of anxieties, with many lines pulled from subreddits like r/MensRights and r/CircumcisionGrief. The original posters\\u2019 toxic brew of insecurity, resentment and hostility was confounding, but it\\u2019s unclear what the show was trying to tell us about it.\", \"Self-indulgence also hampered Braulio Cruz and John-Philip Faienza\\u2019s \\u201cFlow My Tears,\\u201d in which Cruz mused out loud for nearly an hour. Relief occasionally came in the form of electronic-music breaks. The more beat-oriented ones successfully evoked the pulsing atmosphere of a dank Berlin club \\u2014 the kind of experience in which you can lose yourself, until a guy sidles up next to you to share his important thoughts. \\u201cFlow My Tears\\u201d went on to display some doom-scrolling and concluded by breezily taking Philip K. Dick\\u2019s name in vain.\", \"Justin Halle\\u2019s \\u201cCase Studies: A New Kinsey Report,\\u201d directed by Dmitri Barcomi, took a more playful approach under the glamorous guidance of the drag queen Nancy Nogood \\u2014 the closest the festival came to an old-school theatrical creation. Like \\u201cTraffic,\\u201d \\u201cCase Studies\\u201d incorporates a QR code, but no technology could make up for a rambling script that lacked rigor (a problem that plagued almost every project). Still, it\\u2019s hard to be entirely let down by a show that features a dance to Carly Rae Jepsen\\u2019s \\u201cEmotion.\\u201d\", \"In addition to \\u201cTraffic,\\u201d another work got close to fulfilling its ambition: River Donaghey\\u2019s inventive \\u201cRecursiveCast,\\u201d in which Tad and Tammy (Spencer Fox and the Exponential artistic director Theresa Buchheister) host a podcast dedicated to a science-fiction series titled \\u201cRecursive.\\u201d The show is structured like a series of podcast episodes, with the visuals duplicating a Spotify page. Donaghey nails the sci-fi lingo, with casual references to a dodecasphere, for instance, adopting as fans\\u2019 tendency to assign great importance to details.\", \"\\u201cRecursiveCast\\u201d shares with \\u201cTraffic\\u201d a structural descent into uncontrollable disarray, with the world falling apart despite our best attempts at finding some sort of order, whether by trying to escape from a commuting disaster or by scrutinizing triviality. If there\\u2019s a lesson to be drawn, it\\u2019s that technology may have allowed the Exponential Festival to happen against daunting odds, but hey, we\\u2019re all doomed!\"]","href_hash":"f8f68e0e7fa611ecb48cfd56c111385f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f8f68e0e7fa611ecb48cfd56c111385f"}},
