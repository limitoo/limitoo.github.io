Of course, these Republicans will show up for every ribbon-cutting and shovels in the ground photo op in their districts.\", \"Local Democratic candidates and officials should call them out for their hypocrisy. They put embarrassing Joe Biden before improving the lives of their constituents, and that will be remembered in November 2022.\", \"Robert S. CarrollStaten Island\", \"To the Editor:\", \"I was shocked to read the headline \\u201cDemocrats Pass a $1 Trillion Plan for Public Works.\\u201d Lost is the fact that this bill passed with the support of 13 Republicans, without whom President Biden\\u2019s signature bill would likely have failed. This astonishingly rare example of congressional bipartisanship should be widely celebrated and not omitted from the lead headline. To suggest that it was Democrats alone who passed this into law is misleading at best.\", \"We all have a role to play in repairing the deep divisions that exist between Americans, especially those who have great influence.\", \"Mary HimesCos Cob, Conn.The writer is a founding member of BigTentUSA and is married to Representative Jim Himes, a Democrat.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cHow Bill to Fix Infrastructure Survived Brawl\\u201d (front page, Nov. 7):\", \"Am I the only constituent actually proud of the what the Democrats have accomplished? So much emphasis is falling on the schisms within the party and its drubbing in the recent election that an unprecedented and desperately needed investment in infrastructure seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle. When did $1 trillion become a footnote?\", \"Nancy Pelosi has reminded us of how our political process is supposed to work. Where once the clash of ideas and governing principles that led to compromise occurred across the aisle between the Democrats and Republicans, they now flourish between the centrist and left wings within the Democratic Party.\", \"Fiscal caution among centrists tempers the unchecked, however laudable, ambitions of progressives, and the result will still be as broad and impactful a legislative package as has been implemented in half a century.\", \"Meanwhile, in lieu of any dynamic ideas of their own, Republicans sit on the sidelines heckling and hoping that the Dems hoist themselves on their own petard. I fail to see how that is a strategy likely to benefit the American people.\", \"Jordan SollittoSan Marino, Calif.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cThey Broke With Party on Infrastructure Vote\\u201d (news article, Nov. 7):\", \"Representing your congressional district means that you do what is best for your constituents. This may mean making compromises so that legislation can be enacted.\", \"It is so disappointing to see that Representatives Jamaal Bowman (my district) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez along with four other members of \\u201cThe Squad\\u201d voted against this legislation. When we desperately need people to come together, these representatives let us down.\", \"Miriam Kagan MargoshesHastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Last year two Latina girls were photographed in a parking lot accessing a fast-food restaurant\\u2019s Wi-Fi for school work in Salinas, Calif., reflecting the digital divide faced by nearly one in four Latino families across our state.\", \"With the signing of this $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which includes a $65 billion investment for broadband, this family, along with millions of others, will now be able to access and afford the internet so that they can unlock opportunities in education, health care and the economy.\", \"The focus must now turn to implementation. Philanthropic organizations like ours have long supported grass-roots community organizations working to close the digital divide. If the bill\\u2019s aims are to be achieved, we must partner with and invest boldly in these trusted institutions to make these historic investments an immediate reality. We did it for vaccines and we can do it for infrastructure.\", \"Christian AranaSan FranciscoThe writer is vice president of policy for the Latino Community Foundation.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Let\\u2019s hope that the president\\u2019s team will use the passage of the $1 trillion infrastructure package to educate and show the naysayers how their locality will benefit.
