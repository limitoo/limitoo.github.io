And on the muddy shores of this lake, several dinosaur species used to roam, leaving behind tracks that fossilized under the right conditions and, thus, can still be seen today.\", \"After the Purgatoire River flooded this summer, the dinosaur tracks at Picket Wire Canyonlands were covered in several inches of mud and debris.\", \"This prompted specialists and volunteers to start cleaning up the site using shovels and excavators in order to make the tracks visible again.\", \"It was during this clean-up process that crews uncovered the new tracks. Bruce Schumacher, a paleontologist from the Forest Service, told the Gazette that between 100 and 150 tracks had been identified by crews.\", \"The paleontologist said the tracks were likely made by creatures belonging to the Brontosaurus group of dinosaurs. These animals were very large dinosaurs with long necks and tails that lived during the Late Jurassic Period from about 156 to 145 million years ago.\", \"John Linn, a Comanche National Grassland district ranger, told the Gazette: \\\"Every track down there is a national treasure. I hiked it just yesterday actually. It never ceases to amaze me. I'm always overcome with awe when I stand in those tracks that are 150 million years old.\\\"\", \"The round-trip hike to the dinosaur tracks is 11.2 miles long, starting at the Withers Canyon Trailhead. From the trailhead, hikers descend 250 feet into the canyons.\", \"The dinosaur tracks at Picket Wire were first documented by scientists in the 1980s. Since the initial discovery, around 800 additional tracks have been identified, according to Schumacher.\", \"Most of these have been uncovered during clean-ups like the one that revealed the latest finds.\", \"This summer, \\\"there was an event that flooded an area that had not yet been mapped and recorded,\\\" Schumacher said.\", \"The tracks \\\"could continue for a long, long time,\\\" he said. \\\"But we've kind of reached a point where we've got a good amount exposed. At least I feel like we're at a place to continue to manage it as it is.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1934338/dinosaur-footprints.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Stock image showing a set of dinosaur footprints.
