Questions surround City's new-look attacking line-up, too: there are few out-and-out strikers in their defence-heavy squad, with 29-year old Kiwi international Hannah Wilkinson leading the line alongside vastly less experienced players. The return of Kiwi Rebekah Stott from cancer and the emergence of young stars Darcey Malone, Leticia McKenna, Winonah Heatley, and Chelsea Blissett will be some of the few joys in what could end up being another underwhelming campaign.\", \"Prediction:\\u00a08th\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Melbourne Victory</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/97a840beb823bec853632a831eb07b9e\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> With a consistent squad and some of the game's best young players, can Victory make it a second Championship trophy in two seasons?(Photo by Amy Halpin/Speed Media/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)</div>\", \"Coach: Jeff Hopkins\", \"Last season: 3rd (Champions)\", \"In: Casey Dumont, Courtney Nevin, Emma Robers, Alana Murphy, Harriet Withers, Lynn Williams\", \"Out: Gaby Garton, Annalie Longo, Lisa De Vanna, Natalie Tathem, Angie Beard\", \"Rising star: Polly Doran\", \"Key question: Can they do it again?

Her experience and leadership aside, Polias was also one of Sydney's most important players on the field last season, ranking in the top five across the league for goal involvements - particularly from set pieces. Fellow veteran Ellie Brush has also been ruled out with a second ACL injury, though the recruitment of\\u00a0 33-year old Chilean Maria 'Cote' Rojas from Adelaide could counter-balance that loss of maturity and experience.

The benefit of being a new team is there are few, if any, expectations.
