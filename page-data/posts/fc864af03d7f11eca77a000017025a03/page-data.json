Workers can alternatively get tested at least once weekly for the virus and must wear a mask in the workplace, the AP said.\", \"The approximately 17 million people who work in nursing homes, hospitals and other medical facilities that receive funding from Medicare or Medicaid will not have the option of getting tested in lieu of vaccination Workers can request religious or medical exemptions, although it is unclear how frequently those will be granted.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926217/vaccine-mandates.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Millions of U.S. workers now have a Jan. 4 deadline to get a COVID vaccine. The federal government on Thursday, Nov. 4, 2021 announced new vaccine requirements for workers at companies with more than 100 employees as well as workers at health care facilities that treat Medicare and Medicaid patients. A syringe is prepared with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at a clinic at the Reading Area Community College in Reading, Pennsylvania, on Sept. 14, 2021.</div>\", \"It was unclear how OSHA planned to enforce the rules. A senior administration official said the agency would target companies if it gets complaints.\", \"The release of the rules followed weeks of regulatory review and meetings with business groups, labor unions and others. The regulations form the cornerstone of Biden's most aggressive effort yet to combat the spread of COVID-19, which has killed more than 740,000 people in the U.S.\", \"OSHA drafted the rules under emergency authority meant to protect workers from an imminent health hazard. The agency estimated that the vaccine mandate will save more than 6,500 workers' lives and prevent more than 250,000 hospitalizations over the next six months.\", \"Senior administration officials said the rules preempt conflicting state laws or orders, including those that ban employers from requiring vaccinations, testing or the wearing of face masks.\", \"The administration will face an immediate challenge from GOP state officials who are eager to fight Biden in court and Congress. Senate Republicans immediately launched a petition to force a vote to overturn the vaccine mandate, but with Democrats controlling the chamber, the effort is nearly certain to fail.\", \"More than two dozen Republicans serving as state attorneys general have indicated they plan to sue, arguing that only Congress can enact such sweeping requirements under emergency authority.\", \"Last week, 19 states sued to stop Biden's narrower mandate that employees of federal contractors be vaccinated. That requirement was scheduled to take effect December 8, but the administration said Thursday it will be delayed until January 4 to match the requirements on other large employers and health care providers.\", \"The rules will require workers to receive either two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine by January 4 or be tested weekly. Employees who test positive must be removed from the workplace.\", \"Companies won't be required to provide or pay for the tests, but they must give paid time off for employees to get vaccines and sick leave to recover from side effects that prevent them from working. The requirements for masks and paid time off for shots will take effect December 5.\", \"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a separate rule requiring vaccination for workers in 76,000 health facilities and home health care providers that get funding from the government health programs. A senior administration official said that several large private health care organizations imposed their own mandates and achieved high vaccination rates\\u201496 percent or higher\\u2014without widespread resignations.\", \"The White House sees the new requirements as a potent tool to winnow down the ranks of the tens of millions of Americans who have thus far refused to get a shot.\", \"For weeks, Biden has encouraged businesses not to wait for the OSHA rule to take effect. He has touted businesses that have already announced their own vaccine mandates and urged other companies to follow their lead.\", \"Administration officials say those efforts are paying off, with about 70 percent of the nation's adults now fully vaccinated.\", \"Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, said in late July it was requiring all workers at its headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, as well as its managers who travel within the U.S., to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by October 4. But the company had stopped short of requiring shots for its front-line workers.\", \"United Airlines required U.S. employees to get vaccinated or face termination. Only a very small number of its 67,000 workers refused to do so.\", \"In August, Tyson Foods told its 120,000 U.S. workers that they must be vaccinated by November 1. A week before that deadline, the company said 96 percent of its workforce was fully vaccinated.\", \"However, some companies have expressed fear that some vaccine-hesitant workers might quit, leaving their workforces even thinner in what is already a tight labor market.\", \"Several large business groups complained about the timing of the mandate. Retail groups worried that the requirement could disrupt their operations during the critical Christmas shopping period. Retailers and others also said it could worsen supply chain disruptions.\", \"The National Retail Federation suggested that the new rules are not needed because the rolling average number of new daily cases in the U.S. has fallen by more than half since September.\", \"\\\"Nevertheless, the Biden administration has chosen to declare an 'emergency' and impose burdensome new requirements on retailers during the crucial holiday shopping season,\\\" said David French, a senior vice president for the trade group.\", \"The number of new coronavirus infections in the U.S. is still falling from a summer surge caused by the highly contagious Delta variant, but the rate of decline has slowed in recent weeks. The seven-day moving average is down 6 percent from two weeks ago, at more than 76,000 new cases and 1,200 deaths per day.\", \"The mandate on federal contractors led to demonstrations by opponents, including workers at a NASA rocket engine test site in Mississippi. Some said they are immune because they contracted COVID-19. Others said vaccines violated their religious beliefs and constitutional rights.\", \"\\\"No one should be forced to take a medical treatment just to keep their job,\\\" said Nyla Trumbach, an engineer at the site. \\\"There's years and years of experience and skill out here, and I just want anyone who's watching to see what we stand to lose here if these people don't keep their jobs.\\\"\", \"Dozens of groups sought meetings with administration officials to air their concerns and objections to likely provisions of the OSHA rule, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the AFL-CIO and anti-vaccine organizations.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926237/covid-vaccine-site.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The COVID-19 vaccine mandate for U.S. workers at companies with 100 or more employees will take effect Jan. 4, the federal government announced Thursday.
