A fact sheet from the White House highlighting the increase in tests said they will \\\"help schools safely remain open and implement screening testing and test-to-stay programs.\\\"\", \"With the latest push to boost testing in schools, the Biden administration said it will distribute 5 million free rapid tests to K-12 schools each month. The tests will be used for screening testing, in which some students are tested regularly with the goal of identifying those who are asymptomatic, and test-to-stay programs, in which students exposed to COVID-19 can stay in school so long as they continuously test negative and follow mitigation measures.\", \"States can request the additional tests for high-need school districts, with the first shipments expected to be delivered later this month, according to the White House.\", \"The administration said it is also making lab capacity available to support an additional 5 million PCR tests per month.\", \"In the past year, the Biden administration provided $10 billion for states to set up K-12 testing programs for students and faculty and $130 billion for the safe reopening of schools through the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan enacted last year.\", \"The latest investment in tests for schools comes as Americans are still struggling to find at-home COVID-19 testing kits and, in some places, face hours-long waits at testing facilities.
