The New York City medical examiner determined he had hanged himself with a bedsheet on a night when he was alone because his cellmate had been transferred.\", \"His death in Manhattan set off a rash of unfounded conspiracy theories on social media that were picked up and repeated by high-profile figures, including Mayor Bill de Blasio and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. But investigations by the F.B.I. and the Justice Department\\u2019s Inspector General found no evidence of a conspiracy, proving Mr. Epstein\\u2019s death was a suicide, the Attorney General at the time, William P. Barr, later said.\", \"It was not the first time he had tried to kill himself. A month earlier, after being denied bail on federal sex trafficking charges, Mr. Epstein was found unconscious in his jail cell with marks on his neck in what prison officials investigated as a suicide attempt.\", \"The Friday morning before he died, thousands of documents from a civil suit had been released, providing lurid accounts accusing Mr. Epstein of sexually abusing scores of girls.\", \"Investigations into the suicide found jail officials had made serious mistakes. Mr. Epstein was supposed to have been checked by the two guards in the protective housing unit every 30 minutes, but that procedure was not followed that night. One of the guards was not a full-fledged correction officer.\", \"In addition, because of Mr. Epstein\\u2019s earlier attempted suicide, he was supposed to have had another inmate in his cell, officials said. But the jail had recently transferred his cellmate and allowed Mr. Epstein to be housed alone, a decision that also violated the jail\\u2019s procedures, the two officials said.\", \"Two days after Mr. Epstein died, Mr. Barr said he \\u201cwas appalled\\u201d by the suicide and sharply criticized the management of the jail. He ordered a full investigation. The warden was transferred.\", \"The two guards, Michael Thomas and Tova Noel, were charged criminally with ignoring their duties and then lying about it. Prosecutors said the guards had been browsing the internet and napping rather than checking on Mr. Epstein every half-hour as they were supposed to the night he died. They were also accused of falsifying official logs, recording they had made the rounds. In May, they reached an agreement with prosecutors that allowed them to avoid prosecution and do community service.\", \"This year, a trove more than 2,000 pages of Federal Bureau of Prisons records obtained by The New York Times after filing a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit suggested Mr. Epstein had gone to lengths to persuade jail officials that he was not suicidal after the first apparent attempt to hang himself in July 2019.\", \"The notes and reports compiled by those who interacted with Mr. Epstein during his 36 days of detention show how he repeatedly assured them he had much to live for, while also hinting that he was despondent. After the first attempt, for instance, Jeffrey Epstein said he \\u201cwonderful life,\\u201d denying any thoughts of ending it, even as he sat on suicide watch.\", \"\\u201cI have no interest in killing myself,\\u201d Mr. Epstein told a jailhouse psychologist. He was a \\u201ccoward\\u201d and did not like pain, he explained. \\u201cI would not do that to myself.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ebe13e4652e511ecb32d6b5d32768360"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ebe13e4652e511ecb32d6b5d32768360"}},
