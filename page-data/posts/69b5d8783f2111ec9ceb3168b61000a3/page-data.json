The editorial highlighted remarks from U.S. Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro, who expressed concern this past week about the \\\"rapid expansion\\\" of China's navy.\", \"Taiwan, an island nation, is claimed by China under its \\\"one country, two systems\\\" constitutional principle. However, the democratically-run East Asian country has operated with autonomy and the support of the U.S. for decades. In recent years, analysts have increasingly warned that Beijing could move militarily to take control of the island by force.\", \"\\\"We need to make the US aware that no matter what threats it poses or forces it uses, China's reunification will eventually happen.
