Peng, 35, wrote that Zhang, now 75, and his wife played tennis in Beijing about three years ago and that he later brought Peng into a room at his home where the assault occurred.\", \"\\\"I was so frightened that afternoon, never thinking that this thing could happen,\\\" the post said.\", \"The post was deleted quickly and a search for Peng's account on the platform now provides no results. The accusation is the first against a prominent government official since the #MeToo movement began in China in 2018. The #MeToo movement was quickly stamped out by the Communist Party in the same year and cracked down on civil society.\", \"The Communist Party continues to shut down assault cases such as Peng's, as activists' online posts have been censored or deleted. China's response to Peng's case and the #MeToo movement illustrates its determination to control public opinion and restrain social movements it may not be able to control.\", \"The Associated Press could not verify the authenticity of Peng's social media post since it had been deleted, although screenshots of the post have circulated on Twitter, which is blocked in China.
