Life-changing surgeries and treatments will be cancelled, and there'll be a lower level of care than many patients may expect.\", \"It is dire.\", \"The government says the health services are doing the best they can in the most trying circumstances, but it's more than reasonable to ask why the hospital system was not better prepared.\", \"\\\"We are open. There are impacts of this variant, there are impacts of this virus,\\\" Andrews said on Thursday.\", \"Over the past few months, there's been a major shift in the Premier's approach and rhetoric, one that both reflects the reality of Omicron and the political climate \\u2013 there's only a dribble of social licence left to implement tough measures.\", \"But it does beg the question, could the crisis in the health system have been avoided?\", \"The recommended public health measures, such as density limits and mask mandates, are now only one part of the equation for the government to consider.\", \"In the past, the most draconian measures \\u2014 remember closing playgrounds? \\u2013 were justified by \\\"public health advice\\\".\", \"Even this week, the \\\"public health advice\\\" was cited as the reason that IVF procedures could resume after they were cancelled by the Code Brown. But when other life-changing procedures that don't impact health capacity remain closed, it can get very confusing.\", \"Amidst all the doom and gloom, governments are desperate to project some positivity by trying to focus on the future, telling a weary public this chaos won't last.\", \"And because of the contentious pandemic laws, the government is also forced to show the reasons behind its rules.\", \"This has helped Andrews because it details that his government has rejected advice, in order to protect society and the economy.\", \"Before Christmas, the government ignored advice from Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton to reintroduce density limits and ban dance floors to slow the Omicron wave.\", \"\\\"The public health team will also put forward advice that is very much focused on public health, and that's what you want them to do. Their job is not to run the economy, their job is not to deal with a much broader framework, that's the job of government,\\\" Andrews said this week.\", \"NSW has led the way with this approach, and Andrews has followed, with the fate of NSW providing some political cover for the Andrews government. It also left him little choice, especially with a lockdown-fatigued public.\", \"The view among some senior members of government is that this wave cannot be stopped, and it's better to deal with it quickly rather than allow it to slowly crash on Victoria.\", \"On Sunday, the government is set to outline how the return to school will work, and it's adamant there'll be no delay to term one.\", \"The plan will be in lock step with NSW, the country's two biggest states working hand in glove despite being on opposite sides of politics, a formidable faction for the Prime Minister to deal with at national cabinet.\", \"Teachers, experts and some in government are bracing for the return to school to trigger a fresh wave of cases.\", \"Health groups, including the Australian Medical Association, continue to demand tougher restrictions to dampen COVID's spread and ease the pressure on hospitals.\", \"Without government action, Victorians have voted with their feet.\", \"Fewer people are going out and about, many choosing to stay at home or are being forced into isolation. Data this week showed foot traffic in the city was approaching lockdown levels.\\u00a0\", \"The economy is grinding to a halt, with many businesses saying the past weeks have been worse than lockdown because there is no government support, be it federal or state.\", \"This is a sore the government would not want to let fester, and it has already extended some commercial rent relief programs.\", \"And as loud as some anger is for Andrews, rightly or wrongly most of the public blame for the shadow lockdown is being laid at the feet of the Prime Minister.\", \"Both state and federal governments have been caught unprepared for the Omicron wave, especially when it comes to testing regimes.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/19cb06c29733b5267cd50e613d113e22\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The unavailability of RATs has become the latest thorn for the prime minister.(ABC Sunshine Coast: Owen Jacques)</div>\", \"The political fallout of the Omicron wave is hurting the federal government more than the state.\", \"Andrews' tough measures last year, and the fact NSW moved first to ease restrictions \\u2013 with the encouragement of the Prime Minister \\u2013 means that there's less blowback on Victoria, especially given a cohort, including loud media voices, demanded the state reopen.\", \"The unavailability of rapid antigen tests (RATs)\\u00a0has become the latest thorn for the PM, especially the Commonwealth's reluctance to make them free for all.\", \"Out of both necessity and politics, Andrews has ordered 210 million RATs to cater to\\u00a06.6 million Victorians over the coming months.\", \"Some have questioned why these weren't ordered earlier given their widespread use overseas.\", \"Like so much during this pandemic, Andrews hasn't worried about the price tag.

We should be ready.\\\"\", \"But the ongoing pandemic has made the job of opposition even harder than before, and leaders like Guy are starved of oxygen.\", \"Some of the arguments the Coalition has mounted have also confused voters.\", \"Before Christmas, Guy railed against the Premier's decision to continue to keep the mask mandate for retail and said the government shouldn't panic over the 14th variant of COVID-19.\", \"In the new year, as Victorians either isolated or stayed home to avoid the virus, the opposition blamed the government for overseeing the shadow lockdown and argued against some of the rules even while Victorians, indeed, Australians, chose to stay home to avoid the virus.\", \"Normally, the summer is a downtime for politics, especially in an election year. In 2022, Victorians will vote at both state and federal levels.\", \"Tuesday marks exactly two years since the first case was detected in Victoria, and since then, nothing has run normally.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f0840618c24e470e920bdb567058f650\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> There is anger\\u00a0in some pockets of Victoria over\\u00a0the way Andrews has handled the pandemic.(AAP: James Ross)</div>\", \"There is palpable anger towards Andrews in some pockets of Victoria, with some\\u00a0feeling government has let them down at a time when it was needed most.\", \"But polling repeatedly shows that Labor is on track to be returned for a third term.\", \"This was reinforced this week with a survey in The Age showing Andrews continuing to enjoy popularity.\", \"Despite changing horse mid-stream last year, the opposition continues to struggle to make ground.
